"Remarks at Old South Meeting House in Boston, Massachusetts",2019-12-31T00:00:00+00:00,Elizabeth Warren,/documents/remarks-old-south-meeting-house-boston-massachusetts,"
[As prepared for delivery.]
In a few hours, the dawn of a New Year will break over America, offering us a moment for pause and reflection.
It is normally a moment for optimism. But let's face it: This year in America has been anything but normal.
In the past 12 months, the president has become bolder with his lies and more brazen in his law-breaking. He tried to squeeze a foreign government to advance his own personal political fortunes.
Meanwhile, the Republicans in Congress have turned into fawning, spineless defenders of his crimes.
It brought no one any joy, but the House Democrats upheld their sworn duty to the Constitution and impeached the president of the United States. Soon I will return to the Senate to do my sworn duty as well.
But unless some Senate Republicans choose truth over politics, Donald Trump will be emboldened to try to cheat his way through yet another election.
So as we turn the page tomorrow — into an election year and a new decade — there is a chill of fear in the air.
People are afraid. Afraid for their families and neighbors. Afraid for the children locked in our detention centers and the children on lockdown in our schools. Afraid for women, LGBTQ+ people, especially trans people whose rights will be decided in the Supreme Court next year. Afraid for our country. Afraid for our planet.
And the danger they feel is real. Our democracy hangs in the balance. And now it comes to us — now it comes to us to fight back.
We are a nation that fights back. Fighting back is an act of patriotism.
We fought back against a king and an empire to form a new republic. We fought back against the scourge of slavery even after it was written into our constitution. We fought back against worldwide economic depressions. We fought back against fascist tyrants.
Those moments in American history define us. And at each one of them, if our leaders had approached the moment thinking small, we would not have made it through. Americans do big things. That's who we are. And our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on.
And that is why I come to you on this New Year's Eve with a heart filled with optimism.
We became the world's leading industrial producer and simultaneously gave workers the right to join unions and the right to live decent lives. We created breakthroughs in science and technology and connected the world through the internet. We rocketed to the moon.
We created some of the most beautiful and profound art and music the world has ever seen or read or heard.
And these achievements, these victories — not one of them was born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams.
They were rooted in our unique ability to turn despair into hope, fear into courage, improbability into triumph.
They were born of our ability to imagine a better world, to imagine it so clearly and so thoroughly that we fought for it with everything we had — and turned things we could only imagine into reality.
We are gathered here today in a house of worship. For half a century leading up to the American Revolution, this place served not only for prayer, but also as a safe haven to test out our early ideas of freedom, justice and equality. A hotbed of resistance and rebellion. A center of bold progressive dialogue.
Here, in this room, men and women gathered to confront the moral and ethical challenges of the day. They discussed. They debated. And ultimately, they launched a challenge to the oppression of British rule and started a Revolution.
Here, as they took their places among these pews, the spirit of the American imagination was formed, meeting by meeting, vote by vote, speech by speech.
I want to tell you about one of the people who sat in this very room. A young girl. A young, enslaved girl named Phillis Wheatley.
Born in West Africa, Phillis was kidnapped by slave traders and brought to New England in 1761. From a young age it was clear that Phillis was an extraordinary person. She mastered English, Latin, Greek and English literature at a time when enslaved people could be condemned to death for learning. As she entered her teen years, she became a writer. Back in the early 1770s, as she sat in this church, in these pews, Phillis scoured the holy scripture for the words she needed to give voice to her visions and to spark her imagination.
She imagined a world that did not yet exist, but a world she could see. She penned ideals of a better America. Ultimately, she inspired leaders like George Washington himself. She showed through her work the power of imagination to help fuel a revolution.
Week after week, Phillis came to this room and imagined. Years before the Revolutionary War, she became the first Black woman to publish a book of poetry in America. Her imagination is woven into the tapestry of America's story.
So, just for a moment, here in this place of ideas that took root and shaped a nation, here on the eve of a New Year, let us come together to imagine. Imagine what our country will look like, imagine what your own life will look like, when we finally turn this page in our history.
Now I know some of you may be thinking — imagination? Imagining alone won't be enough. And you are right.
But imagination is powerful. It forces us to contemplate change in our lives; to begin to expect change. Taking the time to see ourselves and our world better than they are today sparks urgency in our hearts and determination in our minds.
So today we come together to imagine.
To imagine a country where the decisions made in Washington aren't simply bought and paid for by lobbyists and big donors.
To imagine a country where the fossil fuel industry doesn't have a death grip on our planet.
To imagine a country where private prisons and detention centers don't exist and no one makes a profit from locking people up.
To imagine a country where the NRA and gun industry don't get to put their own profits above the safety of our children.
To imagine a country where big drug companies and the insurance industry don't stand between Americans and the basic health care they need.
To imagine a country where no politician has to kiss the rings of the rich in order to win elected office.
We come together to imagine this reality because this reality is now within our reach.
When I am president, we will attack corruption in Washington head on. We will attack the concentration of power that makes this government work great for the wealthy and well-connected, and not for much of anyone else.
On day one, we will start to make big, structural change to put the people in charge of our democracy — so we hear everyone's voice and count everyone's vote.
On day one, we will start to make big, structural change to end the rigged economy and to create a new set of rules — rules that give everyone a chance to succeed.
In my administration, we will build an America where you and your neighbor can celebrate each other's success because you both know that our economy isn't a zero sum game. That we each do better when everyone has a fighting chance to build real security and thrive.
Exactly a year ago today I got in the race for president. And I made the decision to run a campaign straight from the heart. As I stand here today, I am deeply grateful that so many of you have put your full hearts into this campaign, as well.
Over the past year I've had the chance to shake hands or hug nearly 100,000 people in more than 190 town halls across the country. Sure, there are lots of differences among us.
We're tall and short. We have different accents, different needs, different talents, different problems, and different dreams. But for all of our differences, we are ready to fight side-by-side for our common aspirations.
I've met voters in big cities, small towns and rural areas who are committed to tearing down the legacy of systemic racism.
I've met straight Americans who are committed to the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. I've met men who are committed to the fight for reproductive rights. Farmers worried about the threat of automation and employees of startups in Silicon Valley who know that companies like Facebook and Amazon threaten our economy and our democracy.
One year into this campaign, you've never found me behind closed doors with corporate executives or spending hours on the phone sucking up to rich donors to fund my campaign.
One year into this campaign, and I'm still listening and learning from people across this nation. Because those moments of deep connection are intense, and they sometimes echo heart-gripping fear.
Children who don't want to get shot at school. Young people who say they'll never be able to pay off their student loans. Seniors whose Social Security check just won't cover the basics.
But fear never dominates. People tell me what's broken, but the fear always comes lit by a hope for change.
Hope for change because they believe in America, and in each other. And I believe too.
My plans for this country have been influenced by letters pressed into my palm by little girls.
My will to fight has been strengthened by the people who have whispered their dreams into my ear.
My determination to lead a movement has been forged by the tens of thousands of people who have said they are ready to fight for the country they know we can be.
So, just for a minute, imagine what that country could mean for you. Imagine who you could be if America worked for everyone.
Imagine how you could thrive if America was safe for everyone. If you lived in a community without fear. Without fear of oppression, of violence, of anti-semitism, white supremacy, and police brutality, how would you live your life?
If you were no longer tied to your job in order to pay off student loan debt, where would you go? Try a different job? Move back to your hometown? Start your own business?
If you were no longer paying half your income in rent, what could you do? Pay off your credit cards? Put money in a savings account? Get a dog? (That idea came from Bailey — but think about it.)
If you were no longer stretched to make ends meet, who would you be? A coach? A volunteer? A parent?
And if you could make these changes, what opportunities would it open up, for you? For your children? For your grandchildren?
And imagine a country where every child is treated as so valuable to all of us that their education is a top priority. Imagine a country where teachers are deeply respected for the work they do — and paid accordingly. Where children with disabilities get the services they're entitled to and the assistance they need. Imagine a country where no child ever has to do an active-shooter drill again.
And imagine a country where every young adult is treated as so valuable to all of us that technical school, two-year college or four-year college is tuition-free and ready to welcome every one of them.
Imagine fleeing violence and oppression and finding an America that matches our best values every day and welcomes asylum seekers and refugees with care and compassion.
And while you're imagining, please re-imagine health care.
If you're part of a typical American household, your family spent almost $12,000 on health care last year. About 1 in 5 of you — including people with insurance — didn't fill a prescription because you couldn't afford it.
So now, imagine an America where Medicare for All ensures health care is a basic human right. Imagine an America where you could get your prescriptions filled, without worrying about the cost.
Imagine an America where Black maternal health is a priority. Imagine an America where, if you get really sick, you can concentrate on getting well — and not worry about bankruptcy.
Imagine an America where monthly social security checks are big enough to cover the bills and leave a little extra for home repairs or an occasional meal out — or maybe birthday presents for the grandchildren.
While the survival of every living thing on this planet hangs in the balance, while fossil fuel companies still call the shots in Washington, imagine an America that has come together to beat back the climate crisis and embrace a Green New Deal.
Imagine what's possible when poor communities and communities of color are no longer dumping grounds for toxic wastes and polluting industries.
And just one more. Right now in America, women make up 51 percent of our population. We account for nearly 50 percent of the workforce and earn more than 57 percent of college degrees. But only about 29% of elected offices in America are held by women.
So imagine an America where more women — women of color, LGBTQ+ women, women with diverse backgrounds — have more power to make the right decisions for our country.
Imagine an America where the lived experience of women… is reflected in committee rooms and corner offices and yes, even that really nice Oval-shaped office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Imagine an America where no matter the color of your skin, who you love, how you worship, where you were born, or what zip code you live in, you are safe and your opportunities look pretty much like everyone else's.
If you can imagine all this — if you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years — then you are more than halfway there. The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it.
We begin this fight with a hard truth: No one who has power in Washington is going to give it up easily. Many corporate executives and career politicians and billionaires on both sides of the aisle want to keep their influence and their wealth. And they are already deep in the fight to do so.
Look at the facts.
Americans overwhelmingly believe that health care is a basic human right. But the private health insurance industry is dumping millions of dollars in false TV ads to scare people away from any change. And the corporate interests know which candidates for president are on their side.
A huge majority of Americans support a wealth tax. But billionaires are on TV claiming that it's impossible to get it done anyway, so we shouldn't bother trying. The billionaires know which candidates for president are on their side.
An overwhelming majority of Americans want to reduce the influence of money in politics. But wealthy donors are lined up, checkbooks in hand, buying their chance to lobby candidates privately and maybe even get to be appointed ambassador. And you better believe the big donors know which candidates for president are on their side.
The billionaires, the corporate executives and their favorite presidential candidates have one clear goal: To convince you that everything you imagine is impossible. To convince you that reform is hopeless. To convince you that because no one can be pure, it's pointless to try to make anything better.
Those with power — and those who do their bidding — dump an endless avalanche of excuses, misdirections, and distractions on the American people. It's all designed to get us to give up and resign ourselves to the way things are — with them in power and everyone else left behind.
But we know in our hearts that power in America can rest with the people. We can and we must have an economy and a democracy that finally works for everyone.
And we, the people, know that the America we imagine together is possible when Americans believe in ourselves and in each other — and when we have the courage to fight for it.
Phillis Wheatly was a poet, but her life was not one of gentle remove. She had circulated her poems and published in the journals of the day, and they had begun to receive attention, both here in Boston and around the country. And there was the problem.
The boldness of her imagination frightened some people. It was a terrifying thought, to some powerful white people, that this young woman, this young enslaved woman, would create something so potent that she challenged the existing order.
So, just a few blocks down the road, at the old south courthouse, a group hauled Phillis into court. They demanded that she sit before a panel of eighteen of Massachusetts's most powerful white men. They demanded that she prove that she had written those poems.
In order to continue to circulate her work, she would have to prove that it was possible that an enslaved Black woman could possess the intellectual capacity to write as she wrote.
Their attack on Phillis was an attack on her intellect, on her integrity, on the very notion that she could exist. Their attack was also an attack on the humanity of people trapped in slavery, an assertion of innate non-personhood.
But Phillis stood tall, and by the end of the proceedings, the judges were persuaded, possibly even embarrassed. Phillis left the courthouse going on to become a nationally and internationally celebrated poet. Her poetry caused George Washington to invite her to visit on the eve of the Revolutionary War. In her short life she became a pioneer of Black literature in America.
Phillis Wheatley's spirit is the American spirit. It's the enduring spirit of imagination fortified by courage. Patriotism infused with the dreams of the great country we can be.
Phillis Wheatley challenged the power structure of the 1770s — just a few years before our fledgling nation would challenge the worldwide power structure by taking on a British king in a revolution.
But Phillis' story and the story of generations of African Americans in this country did not end in victory. Phillis married badly and died penniless. And even as the hopes for the birth of a new nation continued to rise, it would be another century before the tyranny of slavery was destroyed and yet another hundred years before African Americans began to experience true freedom and justice in our country.
Yet in the face of hatred, injustice, and oppression, Black Americans throughout our history have never stopped imagining and fighting for a better tomorrow. Not just for themselves, but for our entire nation.
Black history, American history, has shown us the way to the America of our highest ideals. A roadmap of resistance and endurance in the fight to transform the heart of our nation.
And that fight continues to this very day.
2020 is our fight: Our chance to rewrite the rules of power in our country. Our chance to come together despite our differences and mobilize a movement for change.
I believe that when future generations of Americans look back on this time, they will celebrate us for choosing hope over fear, courage over timidity, dreams over cynicism. I believe they will see that we fought to build an America of our best values — an America that works for everyone.
After the lawsuit, while still an enslaved woman, Phillis wrote a poem entitled On Imagination. She asks her readers to embrace the power of possibility. Here are her words:
We on thy pinions can surpass the wind,And leave the rolling universe behind:From star to star the mental optics rove,Measure the skies, and range the realms above.There in one view we grasp the mighty whole,Or with new worlds amaze th' unbounded soul.

In the spirit of one young woman who raised her voice from these pews more than two centuries ago, let us begin tomorrow committed to dream big, fight hard, and win. Happy New Year.

Steyer Campaign Press Release - Tom Steyer Reaffirms Commitment to Immigration Reform in New Ad,2019-12-31T00:00:00+00:00,Tom Steyer,/documents/steyer-campaign-press-release-tom-steyer-reaffirms-commitment-immigration-reform-new-ad,"
(SAN FRANCISCO, December 31, 2019) — Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer launched a new ad campaign highlighting the moment during the last DNC debate in which he distinguished himself as the candidate vowing to undo Trump's attempts to racially divide our country through immigration. The new Every Right ad shows Steyer's commitment to reforming our country's broken immigration system and putting American values before racist practices.
""I think it's important to note that this president is not against immigration, he's against immigration of non-white people,"" Steyer said in the ad. ""And it's led him to break the laws of humanity in our name. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human-being on every right.""
The new ad comes as Steyer continues to pick up momentum in the early primary states. The most recent Morning Consult poll showed him with 10% support in early caucus and primary states, where Steyer has primarily been on the ground with voters.
See below for the full script:
I think it's important to note that this president is not against immigration, he's against immigration of non-white people.
This is a racial argument by a racist president.
Who's trying to divide us. It's absolutely wrong.
And it's led him to break the laws of humanity in our name.
We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human-being on every right.
I'm Tom Steyer and I approve this message.

Article by Mike Bloomberg - You're In Charge: Forget Your New Year's Resolution,2019-12-31T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/article-mike-bloomberg-youre-charge-forget-your-new-years-resolution,"
This article was written by Mike Bloomberg.
Every December 31st, a time-honored tradition brings Americans of all backgrounds and faiths together: making New Year's resolutions that won't last. It happens in business and government all the time, too – and on a much larger scale.
Business owners and managers often think they need a long-term plan, sometimes because a consultant told them that. And politicians often set goals for many years or even decades after they're gone from public office – without detailing interim targets that the public can hold them accountable for achieving.
It's easy to make long-term resolutions, and there's a certain escapism that comes with it. Why roll up your sleeves and get down to work when you could be mapping out an exciting plan for incredible levels of future success? It's tempting to let your mind fast-forward to the finish line, but projecting to step one hundred can limit your ability to execute step one. Successful athletes don't focus on winning the championship – or even on winning the first game. They focus on preparation.
Issues like climate change and gun violence can't wait for decades-long timetables. We need leaders who will attack the problems facing our nation as soon as they can, however they can. I refuse to wait for the perfect solution before making a move. The hardest challenges require action that begins today, not tomorrow—forget long term.
That's not to say there's no value in thinking ahead. My advice is to conduct the following exercise:
Think logically and deliberately about what you'd like to do. Work out all the steps of the process – the entire what, when, where, why, and how. When you know it cold, write it out on a piece of paper. The act of writing forces you to confront questions you hadn't before. Address those things that you forgot, ignored, underestimated, or glossed over in your mind. Make sure your written description follows, from beginning to end, a logical, complete, doable path.
Then tear up the paper – and get to work.
It's a good exercise in planning while also being a good reminder about what matters most. Real life doesn't follow big, carefully laid plans. Setbacks happen. Surprises arise. Small opportunities lead to unforeseen bigger ones. Conditions and opportunities change in ways we can't anticipate – and that can change the direction of our work, and how we define success. You'll inevitably face problems different from the ones you anticipated. Sometimes you'll have to zig when the business plan says zag. Plans are only as useful as your willingness to toss them aside.
A reporter once asked me what I thought Bloomberg had failed at, as opposed to the successes that have allowed us to grow. I gave it some thought, then answered: ""Nothing. But what we accomplished wasn't always what we set out to do."" A failure leads to a new insight or idea that leads to new products and customers. We're flexible and adaptable. If we had stuck to a rigid plan, we might not be as big or as successful today.
Don't let planning get in the way of doing. I once saw the classic cart-before-the-horse error during a presentation by a potential Bloomberg competitor. His slides had great-looking mock-ups of the company's future shipping department, showing conveyor belts shipping out thousands of the units. The problem? They hadn't yet built the first unit. And they never did.
I've always focused on what's next, not what's way down the road. And I have always believed in playing as many hands as possible, as intelligently as I can – and working like crazy today, and getting up and doing it again tomorrow.
People have a lousy record of predicting the future, and they aren't much better at planning it out. By all means, set high goals and dream big. But then get down to work, and as the months and years pass, be ready to change course. The path to success is not a straight line, and the destination may be a place you haven't imagined. The best resolution is to get started on the journey now – and to charge ahead with deliberate speed.

DES MOINES – Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Monday named former Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement (CCI) president, farmer and retired nurse Barb Kalbach as an Iowa campaign co-chair. Kalbach spoke at tonight's town hall in Winterset in Madison County, Iowa.
""I have seen up close how Sen. Sanders listens and responds to the challenges facing Iowa and the rest of the country,"" Kalbach said. ""Bernie knows that one person alone cannot accomplish all that needs to be done. He is the only candidate who recognizes that he needs all of us working together in a grassroots movement.

Kalbach is a fourth-generation family farmer from Adair County. On behalf of Iowa CCI, Kalbach organized a bus tour of factory farms in Iowa with Sen. Sanders and rural advocates earlier this year. Kalbach also worked in Madison County Hospital's nursing units for years and has been a longtime advocate for universal health care in Iowa.

Booker Campaign Press Release - Cory 2020 Launches Six-Figure Iowa TV Buy with New 60 Second Spot,2019-12-30T00:00:00+00:00,Cory Booker,/documents/booker-campaign-press-release-cory-2020-launches-six-figure-iowa-tv-buy-with-new-60-second,"
""The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose… as your president, that's how I will move us forward together.""
Newark, NJ — Cory 2020 will launch a six-figure TV ad buy in Iowa today with a new, 60 second spot that tells the story of Cory Booker's career-long record of success in building uncommon coalitions. Cory has built these coalitions and brought people together in order to take on the biggest challenges in our country — challenges that have left too many people and too many communities behind.
The ad reminds Iowa caucus-goers that Cory is the Democrat who will help Americans recognize our common pain, ignite our spirit of common purpose, and mobilize a coalition big enough to defeat Donald Trump in November.
The ad calls back to Cory's years taking on and beating the Newark political machine and his Senate record bridging partisan divides in order to pass major legislation. It uses excerpts from remarks Cory has made throughout this presidential campaign — and his career. It will begin airing in the Des Moines and Cedar Rapids media markets on Monday, December 30th.
The spot, titled ""He Will Win"", can be viewed HERE.
The 60 second ad was produced by WIN, an innovative firm that takes political media and communication outside the standard confines of politics as usual. The WIN team working with Cory 2020 is comprised of strategic veterans Rick Fromberg and Rania Batrice and Chief Creative Officer Matt McLaughlin.
Below is a transcript of the spot:
There's a spirit in this country that is so powerful.
The spirit of the people who are willing to live every day in pursuit of the dreams that do not yet exist in this country.
It's a story of people constantly demonstrating to be the best of what it means to be an American.
In Newark there are many heroes to hold onto. People who humble me because they have found a way to have unyielding faith.
We face perilous times. The question is, will we show that same level of courage?
The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose, because we know that our fates are united, that we have a common destiny.
And as your president, that's how I will move us forward together.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Andrew Yang Unveils Series of New Policies to Rewrite the Rules of Our Fundamentally Anti-Woman Economy,2019-12-28T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-andrew-yang-unveils-series-new-policies-rewrite-the-rules-our,"
To rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy to work fairly for everyone, Andrew Yang is releasing policies to elevate women to leadership roles in both the public and private sectors, protect a woman's right to choose, and require safe and fair working conditions for pregnant women.
NEW YORK — Today, Andrew Yang released two new major policies: one focused on the promotion of women to leadership roles in the public and private sectors and a second aimed at protecting and expanding a woman's right to choose. To make the 21st century economy work equally for all, Andrew Yang is prioritizing equal representation among leadership roles and women's rights to bodily autonomy.
Andrew Yang has been a long-time champion of elevating women to leadership roles throughout his career, and he will continue to do so as president of the United States. Elevating women to leadership roles within the private sector and government is both prudent and ethical. Studies have shown that organizations with more women in leadership roles are more efficient. More importantly, we should ensure enough women hold leadership positions in our organizations because it's simply the right thing to do.
Andrew Yang is committed to elevating women to leadership roles in the military and in his administration—including cabinet-level positions. His policy focusing on women in leadership incorporates a commitment to appoint women to the federal bench, requires women to be included on corporate boards, and highlights his gender-neutral paid family leave federal mandate.
Andrew Yang believes a woman's right to choose is fundamental. His new policy highlights this as the only way to ensure women are able to fully and fairly participate in today's economy, and it also asserts that women and medical professionals are the only ones who should be trusted to make this decision. Restricting access to abortion bars professionals from providing these crucial services and sets a dangerous precedent for our society as a whole.
In the policy, he highlights his commitment to work with Congress to codify Roe v. Wade into law, appoint judges who support a woman's right to choose, repeal the Hyde Amendment, and increase funding for Planned Parenthood, among other actions.
In addition to policies surrounding women in leadership roles and a woman's right to choose, Andrew Yang released a plan to ensure fair working conditions for pregnant women so that women can continue to advance their careers during and after a pregnancy.
Too often pregnant workers face both discrimination and inadequate support in the workplace. If the rules of our 21st century economy are to work for everyone, pregnant workers must be treated fairly in the workplace and be given reasonable accommodations for their changing physical abilities.
Andrew Yang will advocate for legislation like the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to guarantee pregnant workers reasonable accommodations. He will lobby the states to pass their own anti-discrimination laws to protect pregnant workers until a federal mandate can be passed, and he will implement a comprehensive federal Paid Family Leave plan that provides all families—regardless of makeup—the necessary time to heal and bond with their child.
Women's rights are human rights, and elevating more women to leadership positions and expanding women's right to choose will ensure we are equipped to navigate the dramatic economic and technological shifts ahead of us. Taking these steps will make us a more efficient and more equitable society.

Sanders Campaign Press Release - Zephyr Teachout Endorses Bernie Sanders for President,2019-12-27T00:00:00+00:00,Bernie Sanders,/documents/sanders-campaign-press-release-zephyr-teachout-endorses-bernie-sanders-for-president,"
The anti-corruption scholar and professor will join Sanders for the ""End Corporate Greed"" Tour in New Hampshire
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bernie Sanders today received the endorsement of Zephyr Teachout, a nationally recognized corruption scholar, and one of the lawyers on the first Emoluments lawsuits against Donald Trump. Teachout is a longtime progressive activist speaking on the danger of foreign and corporate money in American politics.
""Bernie Sanders has built an extraordinary multi-class, multi-race movement grounded in community and compassion,"" said Teachout. ""He's showing us that together, we can beat back the corruption of billionaires, beat the reckless profiteering of corporations, and beat Donald Trump. Bottom line: Bernie Sanders is constitutionally incapable of sucking up, and that's why people love him. They know he'll always be on the side of the little guy against big agriculture, big banks, big pharma, big tech, hate, and fear. He's built the kind of movement that we need to fight the corruption that is killing us.""
Teachout's book, Corruption in America, is generally recognized as essential reading in corruption scholarship and a major contribution to understanding the history of corruption law. Her work was cited in the House Judiciary Impeachment Report, as well as by Justice Stevens in his dissent in Citizens United. She was one of the countries' few experts on Emoluments prior to the Trump Presidency, and wrote the first New York Times article raising questions about Trump's pending constitutional violations. She is currently a plaintiff in an ongoing lawsuit attempting to overturn Citizens United.
""Zephyr has dedicated her life to stamping out corruption in our country,"" said Sen. Sanders. ""She has directly taken on the greed of Donald Trump and fought tirelessly for a political system that rejects the influence of big money and special interests. I am honored to receive her endorsement and look forward to working together to defeat Trump and create an economy and a political system that finally works for everyone.""
Teachout will join Sanders for the ""End Corporate Greed"" tour in New Hampshire this weekend, including a Healthcare Affordability Town Hall in Dover, an Environmental and Corporate Greed Panel in Plaistow, a Democracy Town Hall in Concord, and a Town Hall in Newport.

Steyer will make the case that he is the best candidate to go toe-to-toe with Trump on the economy
(Des Moines, IA, December 27, 2019) – Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer will be starting the new year by traveling through fifteen counties in Iowa on his ""People Over Profits"" bus tour, starting in Council Bluffs and ending in Newton. Steyer was recently in Iowa City where he laid out his economic agenda to leverage his decades of experience building a successful business from the ground up and understanding global markets coupled with his success taking on corporate power at the ballot box to reform our system of unchecked capitalism and create nationwide prosperity.
This bus tour is about talking with Iowans about their economic frustrations and future. Steyer will lay out how we can revitalize the rural economy, organize together to take on the corporations that have bought the government, ensure economic justice by undoing the purposeful exclusion of communities of color from wealth building, and build a green economy that saves the planet and creates well paying union jobs. Iowan and senior advisor to the Steyer campaign, Zack Davis said this about the bus tour:
""Tom has demonstrated time and time again that he is ready to take on the tough fights that lay ahead. Whether it's giving rural communities the tools they need to lead on climate or creating a green economy that revitalizes whole communities while saving the planet, Tom has unmatched experience, success, and passion on creating an economy that works for all people. Iowans are sick of a fake businessman who has gone back on too many promises and ruined too many livelihoods. Throughout this tour, Tom will engage directly with Iowans, meeting them where they are, and demonstrating that the way to break the corporate stranglehold on our democracy is to put people over profits.""
The route of the bus tour is:
Jan 1: Kickoff in Council BluffsJan 2: Logan, Manning, Onawa, Sioux CityJan 3: Sheldon, Spirit Lake, Algona, Fort DodgeJan 4: Hampton, Mason City, New Hampton, WaterlooJan 5: Marshalltown, Newton

"Remarks in Des Moines, Iowa",2019-12-27T00:00:00+00:00,Amy Klobuchar,/documents/remarks-des-moines-iowa-8,"
I want to tell you how excited we are to have made all 99 counties today, every one in Iowa. That was great. And also, it was a very, very big moment of pride for me to have my family with me, John and Abigail, when they went to that last county. And so, we were on Christmas Eve, like many of you here, we were at church and we went to see the little, the little nativity play they had during the service. And it reminded me of a story many, many years ago when Abigail was in the nativity play at that same church and she was, back then, now she's 24, then she was four. And she was to play the angel, and they had her draped in these big angel wings, and we were in the pews and she wouldn't go out to practice. And I say to her, ""Why won't you go out there? Why won't you go out there?"" And she goes, ""Mom, I want to be the donkey!"" And I said, ""No, no, no. Jimmy and Joey are the donkey, you can't be the donkey,"" these two hot teenage boys who are in the costume. And she says, ""Well then I want to be Mary."" And I go, ""No, Mary is 14."" I said, ""I don't understand. You have the coolest part. You get to go out at the end and spread your wings. I don't get it."" And she finally looked way up to the top of the church, she says, ""Mom, I don't know how to tell them I don't know how to fly."" And I said to her, that moment, ""Honey, not all angels fly.""
So, I want to start by thanking you for being here on a Friday night when there are a lot of things you could be doing with your time. And you are truly the guardian angels of our democracy because you are giving others that may not even know you, the wings to fly by caring this much about our country and being part of this great process that we call democracy. So, thank you for that.
So, I made this promise to visit all 99 counties before I maybe knew just how far apart or that I'd be visiting a planetarium at 11 at night, but that was, we did that! Or that I thought there maybe would be a hearing coming up, an important one in the next month that maybe I'd have to get 27 counties done in three and a half days. But the point of this, which is you should learn something about me, is I kept my promise.
More than that, it was a statement of purpose for me. And that is that I believe that we need someone as president, who's going to be the president for not for half of America, but all of America – someone who will unite this country and bring people together, not only for a big victory, which we so badly need, but also for even bigger victories to take on the pharmaceutical companies, to bridge the rural urban divide with infrastructure and broadband and expanded child care, and housing. And yes, to save our climate once and for all.
The fact is, we can take back the White House, but we don't want to have that victory by eke-ing it out at four in the morning--yes, it would be nice. But we know if we don't do that, that state at four in the morning will not be Iowa. My theory of the case is if we want to get all of these important things done, we can't just win by a little, we have to win big. And that means keeping the House of Representatives strong, reelecting Abby and Cindy and electing Rita and JD and winning the US Senate seat in the state of Iowa. That is how you send Mitch McConnell packing,
We have this opportunity, an opportunity to turn back the division and exclusion – the bitterness and the hate. We can actually work together again. We have a chance to defeat a man who treats facts just like a brochure copy for one of his fail real estate deals – who's publicly lied--ready for this? The Washington Post keeps track of this. Who has publicly lied over 15,000 times, an average of 14 times, every single day of his term, who cheats the American people like he cheats on one of his golf courses. The difference between the people on the golf courses, is it's people's lives that are at stake when he's President of the United States.
Instead, we can start believing each other again, we can start trusting each other again. We have a chance not only to defeat Donald Trump, but to defeat what stands for. My profound advice, after seeing what has happened around this country, is that we better not screw this up.
I'm Amy Klobuchar and I'm running for president. I'm sure, as I noted on that debate stage, that you all have heard Donald Trump say that he is self-made, but in fact, he started off with a small loan--his words--of over a million dollars from his dad, but actually, over the course of his career, he got $413 million from his dad. $413 million, and the last three years have shown us that that $413 million windfall left him with a sense of what? Entitlement, a sense of actually, vindictiveness for some reason, a sense that even the presidency is just another cookie jar that he can raid.
I come from a different sense, a different set of values. My ancestors, they came to Minnesota as immigrants, looking for a better life. My grandpa was Slovenian, he worked 1500 feet underground in the mines up in northern Minnesota, the iron ore mines, and he did that so he could have a better life for his kids and actually, for his brothers and sisters. He was the oldest boy. And when his parents died, he made sure that they could make it too. And there were eight of them.
But he saved money in a coffee can with my grandma in their basement to send my dad and his brother to college. And my dad went to community college. So that money in a coffee can--and you cannot fit $413 million in a coffee can. That coffee can, that was my family trust. And this is what I believe, and my grandpa knew this when he was forging on the long and dangerous days in that mine. They used to line up the caskets in the church in town. My dad remembers this because so many were lost because our mines were unsafe, before the unions were a major role in making them safe. The opportunity my grandpa got, he gave to my dad, and my dad got a better education. He became a newspaperman. He got to see the world. My mom, she was raised with no money either in Milwaukee, and she came to Minnesota, and she taught second grade until she was 70 years old.
So our family story is a story of opportunity, that simple idea that when you are given an opportunity from a parent or a grandparent, from someone you work with, from a teacher, from a neighbor, from a friend, that should not leave you with a sense of entitlement. No, that should leave you with a sense of obligation. An obligation to lift people up instead of slamming them down. An obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding it for yourself.
So that's really how I got involved in public service. My family, yes, but also because when Abigail was born--she's here, so it's a really useful thing. You can see her beautiful face, but when she was born, she actually was really really sick, and she could not swallow. And it was a big surprise. We thought we're going to have this great, everything was going to be great, like all parents expect, but then, as Ruth Ann knows what happened with her little boy that she adopted, not everything is quite what you expect sometimes. And that's a measure sometimes of a parent, but it's also a measure of a community and how community handles that.
So when Abigail was born she couldn't swallow, total surprise. It was a total surprise. They didn't know if she had a tumor, she was in--passed every test. This little baby in an x-ray, x-ray after x-ray, after x-ray. And I had been up for two nights. And then they said, ""We don't really know what's wrong, but she's in intensive care. She might have a genetic disease. She probably has a tumor, we don't know. But sadly, the insurance rules say you need to get out of here."" And I go, ""What?"" And they said, ""That's the new rules. 24 hours. That's all you can spend in the hospital."" I had no sleep. I was a new mom. They were throwing all the stuff at me that I had to learn and they kicked me out of the hospital. And when John was wheeling me out of that wheelchair, I literally looked up--this is funny, I had this moment in the middle all this tragedy. and I go, ""I bet this wouldn't happen to the wife of the head of the insurance company.""
I did say that. I did take that moment, but in a larger context. But anyway, weeks went by, she was in and out of the hospital. She actually didn't get better for a number of years, she was fed by a tube. But at that very moment, she was hooked up to all these machines. And that was, by the way, a lot of gifts for me, the gift of seeing other parents. She ended up coming through that but a lot of parents whose kids have permanent disabilities, Ruth Ann's story, what they go through, the gift of seeing that firsthand was a gift I brought with me that I hold on to. But the other gift I learned was how to actually get something done. Because when I got out of there, I started reading about that rule and how bad it was for families, and I joined up with some other people in the legislator that had the same problems. I wasn't elected to office at the time so I literally went there as a mom and testified and told my story. And I learned a few things from that experience. Our whole goal was to make sure you got at least 48 hours in the hospital. And the first thing I learned was that, maybe some of our legislators will relate to this, but at the time was almost all men in the Minnesota Legislature and when you start talking about embarrassing things like episiotomies in front of an almost all-male legislative committee, I think they would have passed the New Deal like that. ""Alright, alright, okay!""
And then the other thing that I learned was how to get things done. And in fact, the House and Senate bills were a little bit different. And people were trying to use that divide to try to make it a delay so it wouldn't take effect maybe for a year, maybe for even longer than that. So what I did is I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the people that were trying to delay it. And when the legislators said, ""Well, when should this take effect?"" Because it usually takes effect August 1, and all my friends raised their hand and they were like, ""Now!"" So, not only did they not delay it, they moved it up so it took effect the day the governor signed it. That happened.
That is how we passed one of the first laws in the country, that later became a federal law when Bill Clinton was president, guaranteeing new moms and their babies a forty-eight-hour hospital stay. And after that, I loved this life. I love getting things done for people, I knew you could do it if you just set your mind to it and you're creative about how you got it done. And I want to tell you something very clearly; I am a proud progressive. But I am someone that believes that you can be both progressive and practical at the same time. Because that story, that story I just told you, that was about taking on powerful interests, that was about getting things done, but the only way we got things done was actually by finding some common ground.
In that case, we got really strong support on both sides of the aisle, and we were able to get it done. Common decency, common goals; that's been the hallmark of my work since I got involved in politics, standing my ground while seeking common ground. When I got elected to the Hennepin County Attorney, I was the first woman in that job, I pushed to improve the criminal justice system. I supported, was a strong supporter of drug courts, I still am. And I fought to ban assault weapons even way back then. And I took on hate crimes. When I got to the Senate, I have been responsible, as was mentioned by Andy, for passing over 100 bills--and Ruth Ann--where I am the lead Democrat, including forty-one that broke the gridlock of this administration. That's a nice way of saying Donald Trump signed the bills into law.
So if you cannot make progress, how can you truly be a progressive? You can say you're a progressive, but at the end, after you're there, you're on and you're in, you better have something to show for it. I'm running for president to put an end to the polarization, to the gridlock, to the dysfunction, because it is our only hope of making the American dream real, of giving everyone the opportunity I just told you in my story and I know that you all have your own stories as well.
I will end this president's shameful efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act it's protections for pre-existing conditions. And by the way, as I listened to Ruth Ann's story, you think about that, the people that most came up to me when that was going on in Congress, when that bill was pending, that vote was pending, was people with kids with disabilities. I remember a mom in a small town parade, who was pushing a stroller and she said, ""This is my son. He has Down Syndrome."" She said, ""I will do anything to fight for my boy to keep his health care. But remember,"" she said. ""This is what a preexisting condition looks like."" That's what that fight was about. And by the way, if we look at the Affordable Care Act, I want you to remember one thing as we look at--do you blow it up, do you do this, you know where I am on this. I think we make it better--the Affordable Care Act is now ten points more popular than the president of the United States.
So, as president I know we can build on Obamacare by doing a few things. First of all, ending the privatization of Medicaid right here in Iowa, bringing down the price for consumers with a nonprofit public option. And we can be both progressive and practical by taking on this issue in a smart way, not by kicking 143 million Americans off of their current health insurance, but by making the Affordable Care Act stronger.
You do that with that non-profit public option, you do that by taking on big pharma. And I have been leading that effort since I got into the US Senate. That means getting rid of that provision in law that bans Medicare from negotiating--bans Medicare, it doesn't just say, ""Oh uh."" It bans Medicare from negotiating for better prices for our seniors. They got that in because they have two lobbyists for every member of Congress. They think they own Washington, they might, but they do not own me.
Also, we can also greatly improve the Affordable Care Act and our healthcare system by finally reckoning with the addictions that we face in our state and in our country, and with mental health care. So I combine these two into one policy. They are different in many ways, but my funding sources are the same because so often mental health gets left behind. Yet one in five Americans suffer from mental illness sometime in their life. There are only 64 public mental health beds in the state of Iowa right now. That is a travesty. So we need a president that's willing to come to grips with this and take it on. For me it is personal; my dad struggled with alcoholism most of his life. When I was growing up, by the time John and I got married, he had three DWIs. Two of them were back in the 70s so there wasn't much consequence and he kept drinking. But by the time he got the third one, by the time he got the third one, the law has changed. And the judge looked at him and then he said to him, ""You know what, you got to choose, jail or treatment."" And my dad chose treatment because he had insurance that covered that treatment and because, in his words, he was ""pursued by grace"". He had his faith. He had his family. He had his friends and it changed his life. And so right now--by the way, a little quick note, he is 91 years old. We just saw him at Christmas, visited him in the assisted living. And about a year and a half ago, he was telling me how his AA group still visits him in assisted living. And in his words, ""Well, it's hard to get a drink around here anyway.""
But that changed him. And I think everyone should have that right to have their life changed. I think everyone should have a right to be ""pursued by grace"". That's one big way that we can improve on the Affordable Care Act. Another, by the way, instead of re-litigating this by lawsuits like Donald Trump is trying to get rid of it, we can actually stop those lawsuits. A president can do that herself. Stop those lawsuits, let it be, improve it, and then take on the elephant that doesn't even fit in this room, and that is long term care. We should be dealing with the big, big challenge of long term care, which is everything from finding a cure to Alzheimer's, which is going to affect 14 million people by the year 2050, to improving long term care insurance, to making it easier for people to live in their homes. That is what we should be dealing when we see a doubling of our senior population.
So what else can we do if we have a president who wants to do it? Well, I will take on big oil and take real steps to fight the climate crisis that threatens our existence. I'm not taking a dime of profiteer money in this campaign. And on day one of my term, we will rejoin the international climate agreement. When we got out of that agreement, there were only two countries not in it, Nicaragua in Syria. They have now gotten in the agreement.
I'll take on Big Oil, and take real steps to fight the climate crisis that threatens our existence. I'm not taking a dime of fossil fuel money in this campaign. And on day one of my term, we will rejoin the International Climate Agreement. And out of that agreement, there are only two countries not in it: Nicaragua and Syria. They have now gotten in the agreement. We are the only ones not in the agreement. On day two, we will bring back the clean power rules from the Obama administration which would make a big difference. On day three, we will bring back the gas mileage standards which the car companies in the US had wanted to do until Donald Trump tubed it. And on day four, five, and six, I will introduce sweeping legislation to deal with climate change. And on day seven, we will rest. We won't actually.
So, I actually I was having this issue with my announcement when there was a blizzard with four inches of snow on my head, leading the president to send out a tweet making fun of me for talking about climate change in the snow and giving me the name that I actually liked: ""Snow Woman."" To which I wrote back, ""Mr. President, the science is on my side and I like to see how your hair would fare in a blizzard.""
So, what else. What are some other big challenges that we have to take on? One is taking on the NRA. And like Minnesota is a proud hunting state. So is Iowa. And I look at these gun safety measures and I say do they hurt my Uncle Dick in the deer stand? They do not. Universal background checks do not hurt my Uncle Dick in the deer stand. And the most amazing transformation has happened in our country. It didn't happen when I was in law enforcement when we tried to reinstate the assault weapons ban. We couldn't get it done. Not even with the police chiefs. It actually sadly did not even happen after Sandy Hook when those parents valiantly tried. It happened when those kids in Parkland stood up. That's when things changed in a different way. When those kids stood up, kids across the country saw them and they started asking questions. It was not unlike what happened with gay marriage. Yes, I am aware that Iowa was one of the first states.
What happened was the kids started to say to their dads and grandpas, including boys. Wait a minute, I know I like to go out hunting too but why can't we have universal background checks? Why can't we have a limit on magazines? Why can't we at least have the right amount of time to vet things? That's what changed things.
So you've got to elect people like Abby and Cindy to the Congress that were willing to vote for universal background checks. And I think you know where the story is now. This story is not over, because this story is going to have a major, major chapter in front in 2020. But the chapter on a way was 2018 and that is when the House passed universal background checks after the new Congress came in, they closed the Charleston loophole, which will give police more time to vet and they close the boyfriend loophole which is my bill that I've been trying to push for years that I wrote that says that domestic abusers, convicted domestic abuser should not be able to get an AK-74.
Well guess what happened to those three bills despite having some Republican support in the House? They are all sitting where? On Mitch McConnell desk along with 400 other bills that are awaiting action. So we get back to my original premise that if we want to get these things done, we can't just win by little; we have to win big.
What else do we need to do? We have to end the unfair economic policies of this president who gives billionaires handouts while the rest of us get stuck with the bill. We will never forget his words when he went to Mar-a-Lago after passing the tax bill, surrounded by his friends. Were any of you there? I didn't want to embarrass anyone if they were there. Just wanted to make sure because what he said in that room when he said was, he said, ""You've just got a lot richer."" That's what he said. We will not forget that. That's what he did. He went into that room and said this. Me, I want to come back to this room and say, I got you universal child care. We did that for your retirement, we did that for our seniors, that we did something about climate change. That means representing the people that you were elected to represent. It means connecting an affordable education today's economy, doubling programs for public and private colleges, providing free one and two year degrees. That's what that's what Ruthanne was talking about. Respecting the dignity of work, remembering that we're going to have over a million openings for home health care workers in this country. We are. So if they can't get by and they're not able to afford to live, that's not going to work very well for seniors. So we have to figure out a way to do that. And that means respecting the dignity of work.
On all of these issues, we will be progressive. Yes, but we will also be practical. Real plans, not pipe dreams. A real plan means you're going to know how you're going to pay for it. Check my website, I showed--dotted every single ""I,"" crossed every ""T,"" unlike our current president. And you can pass it into law. A real plan means I will not promise what I cannot deliver. I believe as long as we win by a good margin, we can get all these things done.
Now, we all know there are powerful interests standing in our way. That's why I put forward that 100 day plan. FDR was the first president to do it and he did it because he was facing an economic crisis. We are facing a trust crisis right now. So what we need for people to understand the government has their back is to act immediately. And in that hundred day plan--I suggest you look at it--137 things a president can do without Congress that are legal.
That is the key. And even the lobbyists will not be able to sign off some checks to stop it. A president can do it. First off, it means jump starting the real immigration reform, leading to passing a bill by the end of the year. It means standing with our allies rather than cozying up to dictators, and subverting an election. You've heard of the three r's: reading, writing and arithmetic. Well, I have the five R's for foreign policy. That means restoring American leadership, repairing our alliances, rejoining international agreements, responding to threats around the world in an appropriate way, and reasserting American values. You can really just get it down to one R. And that means returning to sanity in our foreign policy.
And there is something else we must do at home if we hope to lead the world and and we hope to work together as one America to meet the challenges we face. We must heed the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, that we are all quote, ""tied in a single garment of destiny, whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly."" That means when white supremacist rally in support of hate, there aren't good people on both sides. There's only one side and that is the American side and that is the good side. We have to respect all people again, regardless of their race, or their religious faith, or their national origin, or sexual orientation. We have to replace meanness, meaning polarization with cooperation. This means, as I mentioned, taking back the Senate and getting rid of the number one polarizer on Capitol Hill.
It is easy to hurl insults, to peck out angry tweets in your bathrobe, and kick the real work--It's just a bad image, I know--and kick the real work of governing, the real work of leading down the road. It's easy to draw a line in the sand and sketch out grand ideological schemes that may never see the light of day. The hard work, the unglamorous work as these guys sitting behind me know, the real work of democracy is finding what we have in common, what united Americans, what we can actually achieve together. I learned from my grandpa that the real glory comes from doing not what's easy, but what's hard.
I learned that from my dad's struggles with alcoholism that really what matters is you can have the determination and grit to get through whatever obstacles are in your path. I learned from my mom decades in the classroom, that real progress takes patience, not taking your marbles and running home. And I learned in my three terms as a United States Senator, something that the president will never learn. And that is to get across the bridge, you have to build one, not blow one up. And that is what I've learned and it's what I've learned in life that has allowed me to win every single congressional district every single time, three times in every district in Minnesota. And by the way, when I run I help lead not just run for myself. We have flipped the state house every single time I've lead our ticket. We have flipped into Democrat. So if you want to broaden our tent and widen our coalition and to lengthen our coattails in this country, we have to run with that philosophy. If you want to bring common sense to our national debate then I hope you'll work with me. If you want to bring heartland humility to the White House, come join us.
I got in this fight as a working mom. I just told you that story. Like so many of you, who saw injustice and rallied other moms to stop it. That's all it takes, all it has ever taken the will to stand up and say stop. You heard Andy tell the story of Joseph Welch, that lawyer who grew up an immigrant family from Primghar. He was the one that stood up to Joseph McCarthy and said ""have you no sense of decency?"" So many times we see the people that you least expect to win, that you least expect to be the ones that stand up, end up being the ones that stand up to the decency of this nation. So I'm asking you to stand up with me to restore the decency of this nation again, to rise up to make this country work for everyone again, to fight for an America that stands its ground, while seeking common ground. And I'm asking you to join our campaign to make our cause, your cause. And I promise you this, if you do that, the best is yet to come.

Bennet Campaign Press Release - Bennet for America Makes First TV Buy in New Hampshire With Ad Showing How Michael Bennet Is the Opposite of Trump,2019-12-27T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-press-release-bennet-for-america-makes-first-tv-buy-new-hampshire-with-ad,"
MANCHESTER, NH — Bennet for America today launched its first television ad in New Hampshire as part of its integrated strategy to introduce Michael Bennet to the voters who are just now tuning into the race. The ad — ""Opposite of Trump"" — makes clear why Bennet is the best person to beat Donald Trump and lead the country forward.
Last week, the campaign announced it needs to raise $700,000 by January 16th to have the resources to compete in New Hampshire, including for the launch of this ad. Today, it made public that because it has hit $165,000 of its goal, it is immediately investing $60,000 in a week-long TV buy in the Granite State and an expanded digital campaign. The campaign will increase its ad buy over the coming weeks as it continues to raise, and intends to reach a six-figure buy.
""Voters are asking one question in this election: Who can beat Donald Trump?"" said Bennet for America spokesperson Shannon Beckham. ""To beat Trump, we need the opposite of Trump, and Michael represents that in every way. People who are exhausted by the daily circus in the White House are looking for a candidate who will return things back to normal and start to make progress for their families. When Granite Staters meet Michael, they walk away believing he is the leader we need to make that change, and this ad will ensure even more people see why he is the best candidate to take on Trump.""
Earlier this month, Bennet announced his commitment to hold 50 town halls in New Hampshire during the final 10 weeks before the First in the Nation primary. With his tally at 21 town halls since then, Bennet is now tied for #1 among Democrats in New Hampshire Public Radio's tracker of events. Bennet will return to the Granite State for a seven-day trip starting December 30, including hosting the first event of 2020 at 12:01 AM on January 1st. The campaign has also announced new endorsements, including Paul LeBlanc, president of Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), and State Reps. Joyce Fulweiler and Marjorie Smith.
Watch the ad here.
Read a transcript of the ad below.
To beat Donald Trump, we need the opposite of Donald Trump. That's what I am.
Trump has divided our country like no other president. I'll unite the country, and we'll fix it together.
Trump's the first president to take health care away from millions. I have a plan to cover everyone in three years and lower costs, without bankrupting the system.
Trump is a pathological liar. I'll tell you the truth, even when it's hard.
Trump doesn't care about your kids or mine. Every decision I make is for the kids I served as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. I'll wake up every morning thinking about you and your family, and how to make your lives better.
So if you want a president who's focused on the next generation, and not just the next tweet, then give me a look. I'm Michael Bennet, and I'm running for president.

Sanders Campaign Press Release - New Hampshire's Highest Ranking Democrat Andru Volinsky Endorses Bernie Sanders for President,2019-12-27T00:00:00+00:00,Bernie Sanders,/documents/sanders-campaign-press-release-new-hampshires-highest-ranking-democrat-andru-volinsky,"
MANCHESTER, N.H. – Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky of New Hampshire's 2nd District — the highest-ranking elected state Democratic leader and a progressive beacon in New Hampshire politics — is endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Volinksy will share the announcement with voters today at a town hall in Lebanon alongside Senator Sanders, part of Sanders' three-day End Corporate Greed Tour in New Hampshire.
Like Sen. Sanders, Volinsky has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to public service and defending against injustice — from fighting to save the pensions of New Hampshire's public sector union workers to returning over $100 million in overpaid healthcare premiums back to New Hampshire's cities and towns. Volinsky has proven to be a consistent advocate for New Hampshire's schools and property taxpayers for decades, having led the Claremont School Suit legal team that overturned the unfair way that New Hampshire funds its schools. As an attorney, Volinsky has represented victims of workplace discrimination and people injured by big corporations, and has defended against the death penalty throughout the South and before the US Supreme Court.
""The people of New Hampshire, and across our nation, deserve a president who will put working families first. We need a president who will stand with the people as we face the major issues of our time, from confronting climate change with the Green New Deal to making sure no family is left behind by leading on Medicare for All,"" said Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky. ""I believe this election requires a movement; a powerful culmination of honest conversations between people that unite our shared values in the face of overwhelming division stoked by Donald Trump, Chris Sununu, and their acolytes. That is why I am proud to endorse Bernie Sanders for president, because Bernie stands with the people. He knows this election is not about him. It's about all of us.""
Volinsky is currently a Democratic candidate for governor in New Hampshire, focusing his campaign on education, climate action, healthcare reform, and addressing income inequality.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Actor Steven Yeun Endorses Andrew Yang for President,2019-12-26T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-actor-steven-yeun-endorses-andrew-yang-for-president,"
Today, actor Steven Yeun endorsed Andrew Yang for president. Best known for his starring roles in The Walking Dead and Burning, Yeun and his family immigrated from South Korea to the United States when he was young, where he was raised in Troy, Michigan and went to school at Kalamazoo College.
""After meeting and speaking with Andrew Yang several times, I didn't see a traditional politician. I saw a real human being who is authentic and genuinely cares deeply about everyday people and our country. I think he is rising to the challenge of a new world and he's uniquely thinking about the future and the life we will leave for our children and further generations,"" said Steven Yeun.
""We're thrilled and honored to have Steven become a part of the constantly growing Yang Gang. His story is a true testament to the American Dream that immigrants from around the world come to this country to pursue. Beyond his personal success as an actor, it's his humility and kindness toward others that really align with the Humanity First values of our campaign, the same values that continue to power the momentum of our campaign as we head into 2020. Evelyn and I also love watching The Walking Dead, so Steven's support is exciting in many ways,"" said Andrew Yang.
The high-profile endorsement today follows Andrew Yang's commanding debate performance at the sixth Democratic primary debate in Los Angeles. In the day after the debate, the campaign raised $750,000 from 20,000 donations, a third of which came from new donors. The impressive haul adds to the over 350,000 grassroots donors to the Yang campaign, the vast majority of whom are small-dollar donors.

SACRAMENTO, CA – Mike Bloomberg 2020 announced today that Chris Masami Myers will join the campaign as California State Director.

He was previously Executive Director of the California Democratic Party from 2015-2017, overseeing the 2016 presidential primary, and has also worked as Research Director and Managing Director of the state Party. In July of 2017, Chris was appointed by Governor Jerry Brown as Chief Deputy Director of the California Workplace Development Board.
""There is simply no one in California today who can rival Chris' knowledge of our state's politics and nominating process. We are incredibly lucky to have Chris lead our efforts in California, where one in nine national delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday,"" said Kyle Layman, California Senior Advisor for Mike Bloomberg 2020. ""We are building the strongest state operation in California primary history, and I'm proud to welcome him to our team.""
Mike Bloomberg 2020 has hired now more than 200 initial hires in more than 20 states across the country with more to come. In California, the state with the most delegates, the campaign has already hired more than two dozen staffers, less than four weeks from the campaign's launch. These staffers are deployed across the Golden State, and the campaign will further expand its footprint in California in the months ahead of Super Tuesday.
""I am incredibly proud of the work we have done to build a more inclusive and robust California Democratic Party – and I know that the foundation we laid will serve California Democrats for years to come,"" said Chris Masami Myers. ""Despite California's diversity and its impact on our national conversation, past presidential campaigns have taken us for granted. Mike is the candidate that Democrats need to beat Donald Trump in November, and I'm proud to join a campaign that reflects our values and that will take Mike Bloomberg's message to every corner of California.""

"Bennet Campaign Press Release - Bennet Unveils Principles to Guide Trade and Agriculture Policy, Announces Support for USMCA",2019-12-23T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-press-release-bennet-unveils-principles-guide-trade-and-agriculture-policy,"
DES MOINES — As the Senate prepares to vote on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Michael Bennet today unveiled the principles, facts, and policies he will use to guide his approach to agriculture and trade in the White House.
After years of uncertainty caused by President Trump's reckless trade war, Bennet's approach is designed to secure a stronger future for farmers, businesses, workers, and consumers and restore America's economic leadership around the world. His proposals include the creation of a first-of-its-kind Trade Opportunity Fund to help workers take advantage of the opportunities from trade agreements and provide community-level and individual support targeted to places that need it most.
""Globalization is going to shape the American economy in the 21st century whether we want it to or not. Farmers understand that better than anyone,"" Bennet said. ""Unlike President Trump, who has harmed farmers, businesses, and workers with his reckless trade war, I will take the long view to strategically grow markets and restore America's economic leadership around the world. I'll also make investments in rural communities most affected by trade, and start to close the rural-urban divide to stitch our country back together again.""
Bennet also announced his intention to support the USMCA.
""Trump's reckless trade war created uncertainty for farmers in Iowa and around the country. The updated USMCA will give them something they can rely on,"" Bennet said of the USMCA. ""It will bring our trade policies into the 21st century and boost labor and environmental standards in North America. Workers were clearly at the table during these negotiations, and I plan to vote for the deal.""
Bennet has served on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for the last decade, where he has led efforts to create certainty for farmers, open up new export markets, boost rural economies, write and pass two Farm Bills, and most recently push back on the Trump Administration's reckless trade policies. He also serves on the Senate Committee on Finance, which has jurisdiction over trade agreements.
A Bennet administration will:

End Trump's brinkmanship and reckless trade war that has cost our farmers and ranchers money, wasted their time, and closed the door to overseas markets;
Create a new Trade Opportunity Fund, with 20% of the benefits of any trade deal, to help workers take advantage of the opportunities from that trade agreement and provide community-level and individual support targeted to places that need it most;
Marshal our allies and trading partners to collectively push back on China's mercantilist trading practices;
Provide more support for workers and communities by investing $500 billion in the 70% of Americans who do not go to a four-year college and helping economies transition;
Address regional, local, and industry—not just national—effects of trade; and
Include enforceable labor and environmental standards at the core of all trade agreements.

AGRICULTURAL AND TRADE PRINCIPLES
After his appointment to the Senate in 2009, the first committee Michael Bennet requested to serve on was the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Over the last decade, Bennet has led efforts to create certainty for farmers, open up new export markets, boost rural economies, write and pass two Farm Bills, and most recently push back on the Trump Administration's reckless trade policies.
The following principles, facts, and policies will guide the Bennet Administration's approach to agriculture and trade to secure a stronger future for farmers, businesses, workers, and consumers and restore America's economic leadership around the world.
PRINCIPLES
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, GLOBALIZATION WILL SHAPE THE 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY.
As president, Bennet will use trade agreements to shape global practices to intentionally benefit American farmers, businesses, workers, and consumers.
ALTHOUGH TRADE HAS BEEN AN OVERALL BOON TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, IT HAS COME WITH COSTS TO CERTAIN REGIONS.
For too long, we've failed to acknowledge and adequately address the costs to vulnerable communities and workers.
DEMOCRATS CANNOT BE AN ANTI-TRADE PARTY.
Simply offering a list of grievances will not improve global trade practices or create opportunity for working Americans. We need to lead the work of lifting up standards for trade around the world and opening up export opportunities for American farmers, businesses, and workers. In this way, we can better distribute the benefits of trade.
THE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO DRIVE AMERICA'S RURAL ECONOMY MERIT TOP CONSIDERATION IN FUTURE TRADE AGREEMENTS.
Roughly half the soy and wheat grown in this country, and a quarter of the pork produced in Iowa, is sold in overseas markets. Finding new, fast-growing overseas markets to sell products into is vital for the growth of family farmers and ranchers. It is also vital to the 1.2 million jobs sustained by agricultural exports, including jobs in sales, manufacturing, and transportation in rural areas across the country. However, President Trump's trade war has cost U.S. GDP $134 billion to date, exposed farmers and ranchers to retaliation, and sacrificed overseas markets in Asia to foreign competitors like Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia. As president, Bennet will work with our allies to expand agricultural opportunities overseas—not limit them or sacrifice them to other producers.
TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT STRENGTHEN ECONOMIC BONDS WITH ALLIES AND TRADING PARTNERS CAN LIFT GLOBAL STANDARDS ON WORKERS' RIGHTS, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, FOOD SAFETY, AND FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES.
Those rising standards ensure American workers and businesses can compete on a level playing field. Any trade agreement Bennet signs as president will include high and enforceable labor and environmental standards, as well as standards to crack down on unfair competition.
FACTS
TRADE HAS LIFTED AMERICAN GROWTH AND INCOMES.
From 1950 to 2016, trade added $2.1 trillion to the American economy—an average of about $18,000 per household and $7,000 per person. Those averages are not evenly distributed, and some Americans have been harmed by trade. We must address this dislocation, but we cannot ignore the benefits trade brings to our economy.
95% OF THE WORLD'S CONSUMERS LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE FASTEST-GROWING DEVELOPING MARKETS ARE OVERSEAS.
American farmers, businesses, and workers benefit from being able to sell into these fast-growing markets.
EXPORT-DRIVEN JOBS PAY ABOVE-AVERAGE WAGES.
Jobs supported by exports are estimated to pay up to 18% more than non-export jobs.
FARMERS AND RANCHERS NEED TO GROW EXPORTS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
Net farm incomes are down over 30% since 2013, driven in part by President Trump's reckless trade war and failure to secure the certainty that our farmers and ranchers need to grow their businesses. In 2018, American producers exported $140 billion of American-made agricultural products, but since the start of the Trump Administration, American agricultural exports have effectively flatlined.
NEARLY HALF OF OUR IMPORTS MAKE AMERICAN FARMS, RANCHES, AND BUSINESSES MORE COMPETITIVE.
45% of American imports are inputs into other products that are made in America, helping our farms, ranches, and businesses stay competitive in a global economy. Not only have farmers and ranchers been exposed to retaliation on these products, but the cost of imports like fertilizer and farm equipment have risen too.
THE OTHER HALF OF IMPORTS LOWER THE COST OF LIVING, ESPECIALLY FOR THE POOREST AMERICANS.
Reductions in tariffs and expansions of trade have lowered the cost of consumer goods in particular, increasing the purchasing power of all Americans but especially lower-income Americans. On the other hand, increases in tariffs reduce Americans' incomes and disproportionately harm the lowest-income Americans. Tariff increases also harm growth and productivity and lead to more unemployment and higher inequality.
FOR TOO LONG, THE ECONOMY-WIDE BENEFITS OF INCREASED TRADE RESULTED IN IGNORING THE COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED BY TRADE.
Some communities and workers—particularly the nearly 70% without a four-year college degree and regions with high shares of manufacturing employment—have been disproportionately harmed by trade in recent decades.
INCREASED TRADE IS A DEVELOPMENT TOOL.
Trade with developing countries can lift billions of people out of deep poverty and build a global middle class that will continue to grow as a market for Made-in-America products and services. Expanding trade also raises labor standards and reduces pollution as other countries import cleaner technologies and improve their labor practices.
SURVEYS OF AMERICANS FIND STRONG, BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR INCREASING TRADE.
That support has grown as Americans have seen the consequences of President Trump's reckless and nonstrategic trade war, with three-quarters of Independents and Democrats and a majority of Republicans registering as pro-trade in a recent survey.
POLICIES
The Bennet Administration will:
END TRUMP'S BRINKMANSHIP THAT HARMS OUR FARMERS, BUSINESSES, WORKERS, AND CONSUMERS.
The Bennet Administration will end President Trump's reckless trade war that has cost our farmers and ranchers money, wasted their time, and closed the door to overseas markets.
Retaliatory tariffs have crushed soybean and pork exports to China, increased costs for farmers buying fertilizer and equipment, and shut down access to overseas markets—allowing foreign competitors like Brazil to gain a permanent foothold to sell products like soybeans in the region. Agricultural exports are projected to decline by $4.5 billion in 2019, in part due to Trump's trade war. Rising input costs and retaliatory tariffs contributed to a 16% decrease in farm incomes between 2017 and 2018.
Tariffs also cost American households more than $400 in 2018, and are projected to cost double that amount in 2019—more than offsetting the small benefits from the Trump tax cuts for the typical family.
The trade war has recklessly damaged relationships with our allies, undermining efforts to coordinate pressure against China and other bad actors.
Rather than slapping tariffs on our allies and exposing our farmers and ranchers to retaliation, the Bennet Administration will do the hard work of building global coalitions to pressure bad actors while maintaining and opening up new agriculture markets.
CREATE A NEW TRADE OPPORTUNITY FUND TO SUPPORT WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES AS PART OF TRADE AGREEMENTS.
Trade agreements should be accompanied by targeted support for workers and communities to ensure they benefit from the agreement, especially workers without a four-year college degree. Every trade agreement Bennet signs as president will set aside 20% of the benefits, as projected by the International Trade Commission (ITC), to create a Trade Opportunity Fund. These funds will help workers take advantage of the opportunities from that trade agreement and provide community-level and individual support targeted to places that need it most.
The Bennet Administration will empower labor unions, state and local leaders, small businesses, farmers, and trade economists to make recommendations for how best to channel the Trade Opportunity Fund to take advantage of the trade agreement. Together, we will provide targeted assistance to support workers and communities who could face increased competition due to the agreement.
MARSHAL OUR ALLIES AND TRADING PARTNERS TO COLLECTIVELY PUSH BACK ON CHINA'S MERCANTILIST TRADING PRACTICES.
China competes unfairly in ways that disadvantage American farmers, businesses, workers, and consumers. We should not cede to China writing the rules for trade in the Asia-Pacific region as President Trump has done. We should work with partners to set the rules of the road on our terms. Russia, Iran, and North Korea stand to benefit from China's approach to trade, but many more countries share our interests. The only way to apply enough pressure on China to change its behavior is to work in concert with our allies and trading partners. Instead, President Trump has chosen a go-it-alone strategy, in which he launched a reckless and nonstrategic trade war—using our farmers and ranchers as collateral—and alienated our allies and other countries who should be making common cause with the United States to crack down on China's unfair practices.
As president, Bennet will marshal our allies and trading partners around the world to collectively push back on China's mercantilist trading practices. This includes cracking down on China's unfair subsidies of their domestic producers and state-owned enterprises; theft of intellectual property; inappropriate and coercive barriers to selling or operating in China; and economic espionage.
PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FOR WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES.
Even outside the context of trade agreements, we need to do much more to support workers attaining the skills they need to earn a living wage, not just the minimum wage. Bennet's Plan to Reward Hard Work invests $500 billion in the 70% of Americans without a four-year college degree; prevents and fights recessions, which hurt workers living paycheck to paycheck the most; and helps communities facing an economic transition—whether driven by trade or for any other reason. These are all essential policies for the United States to effectively take advantage of trade.
ADDRESS REGIONAL, LOCAL, AND INDUSTRY—NOT JUST NATIONAL—EFFECTS OF TRADE.
We should focus on local and regional effects of trade and trade agreements and do much more to help communities, workers, and industries who are at risk of missing out on opportunities from increased trade. The Bennet Administration will ensure that the ITC analysis fully assesses the regional, local, and industry-level benefits and costs of a trade agreement, as opposed to just the national impact.
INCLUDE ENFORCEABLE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AT THE CORE OF TRADE AGREEMENTS.
The Bennet Administration will insist we include strong and enforceable labor and environment standards at the core of any trade agreement. A strong inspections regime will increase our ability to ensure other countries are abiding by their agreed-upon standards, and act on enforcement more quickly without other countries standing in the way of the dispute resolution process. These standards will lift up other countries' practices so they cannot undercut American workers and businesses by mistreating or underpaying their workers or by shirking their obligations to a clean environment.

Des Moines, Iowa — Today, Brent Oleson — a Linn County Supervisor — endorsed Joe Biden for President. Oleson, a former supporter of Congressman Beto O'Rourke, announced his endorsement of Vice President Biden by citing his experience, plan to build on Obamacare, and unique ability to restore integrity to the Oval Office.

Vice President Joe Biden has a proven record of accomplishment and leadership on these issues. Joe has brought people together to solve problems and find solutions — and he's a respected statesman that can, on day one, restore America's standing in the world after years of Donald Trump's reckless foreign policy. In February, I plan on going to my Iowa Caucus site with my two children to support Joe Biden for president, because their future and dreams for our country depends on it.""
Biden for President has announced more than 185 Iowa endorsements — including a major slate of 25 endorsements last week. Recently, Vice President Biden also earned support from the Mayor-elect of Davenport and the former President of the Iowa State Education Association.

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Bloomberg 2020 Campaign Launches 'We Can't Let Trump Win' Website Featuring a Powerful Video Reminding Democrats What's at Stake in the 2020 Election,2019-12-23T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-bloomberg-2020-campaign-launches-we-cant-let-trump-win,"
Mike Bloomberg is leading a national campaign to defeat Trump in November
New York, NY— Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg today launched a new microsite, We Can't Let Trump Win, that focuses on the damage President Trump is doing to our country and the general election campaign he's been waging since he took office. The site features a new video reminding voters that the Bloomberg campaign's strategy is to run a national campaign, focusing on the states where the general election will be decided.
""We can't afford to wait to start campaigning in the rest of the country,"" a voter says in the ""How We Win"" video, which will become a part of the digital advertising campaign in Super Tuesday states. ""It's time to think bigger and act bolder.""
As mikebloomberg/2020/beat-trump outlines: ""Donald Trump has waged an uninterrupted re-election campaign since his first day in office. Over the past several years, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have raised hundreds of millions of dollars and they are spending immensely on social media. Trump will soon outpace every current Democratic candidate, except Mike Bloomberg, in cash-on-hand by almost 10 times, with millions more pouring in each day. His impeachment has generated a flurry of donations from loyalists. And unfortunately, recent polls show that major Democratic rivals are falling behind in key battleground states, partly a result of Trump campaign efforts.""
The video will also live on the campaign's YouTube channel.
The Bloomberg 2020 campaign has hired more than 200 staffers in more than 20 states, with expansion plans on the horizon. Just this weekend, Mike met voters and opened field offices in Philadelphia, PA, Detroit, MI, and Milwaukee, WI.

Castro Campaign Press Release - Castro Campaign Announces Julián Castro Youth Coalition,2019-12-23T00:00:00+00:00,Julián Castro,/documents/castro-campaign-press-release-castro-campaign-announces-julian-castro-youth-coalition,"
Coalition will work to spotlight important issues and injustices, inspire grassroots support, and empower young community leaders and peers to take action
SAN ANTONIO, TX (December 23, 2019) – On Monday, December 23, the presidential campaign of former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro, announced the Julián Castro Youth Coalition, a group of young leaders from across the country who are committed to fighting for the most vulnerable communities, speaking out on social justice issues, and empowering their communities and peers to take action.
The coalition's founding members include young leaders advocating on issues such gun violence prevention, immigrant rights, environmental justice, and educational equity. The group will host frequent coalition calls, brainstorm campaign travel, highlight issues and injustices, hold grassroots meetings, and recruit other youth leaders across the country.
""I support Julián Castro because of his authentic leadership rooted in understanding the unique needs of communities across our country,"" said Coalition member Marco Dorado. ""He is at the forefront of boldly addressing some of the most pressing issues facing our country in a time when we sorely need leaders to step up to the plate and offer solutions to challenges faced by people across America.""
Thandiwe Abdullah, Coalition member and police brutality activist said, ""I support Julian Castro because he has consistently shown up for black communities targeted by gun violence and has concrete plans to challenge the present and growing threat of police brutality.""
""I have chosen to support Julían due to his genuine commitment to helping end the gun violence epidemic that we are having in this country,"" said Coalition member Ariel Hobbs. It is an issue that affects people all over the country on a daily basis, and for years it has been swept under the rug. For me, Julían is the candidate that I feel truly understands the causes of gun violence. His plan for ending gun violence combined with his other policy stances provide a comprehensive layout that will help end the epidemic.""
""As a DACA recipient myself and someone who aspires to one day serve this country, his resiliency and willingness to continue the fight gives me hope for my future,"" said Coalition member Yazmin Aguilar. ""To me, Julian is the definition of what the American dream.""
Coalition member Aaliyah Joseph said, ""Castro should be the next Presidential nominee because his agenda is an agenda that is empowering Americans that will make this country its most sustainable, equitable, and inclusive self.""
The founding members of the Coalition include:
Marco Dorado ( Immigrant Rights, Economic Opportunity)Carolina Silva ( Education Equity, Immigrant Rights)Maria Yepez ( Immigrant Rights)Yazmin Aguilar ( Immigration and higher education, economic development and social justice)Tatiana Washington ( Gun Violence Prevention)Diego Garcia ( Gun Violence Prevention)Olivia Koulish ( Gun Violence Prevention)Aaliyah Joseph ( Environmental Justice, Racial Equity, Intersectionality)Ariel Hobbs ( Gun Violence Prevention )Thandiwe Abdullah (Police Brutality)Micaela Lattimer (Immigrant Rights)

"Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg Rebuilding 'Blue Wall' in PA, MI, WI",2019-12-21T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-rebuilding-blue-wall-pa-mi-wi,"
Opens Campaign Offices Today in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee, Totaling 5 New Offices in 5 States This Week
Today, Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is meeting with voters and opening campaign offices in Philadelphia, PA, Detroit, MI, and Milwaukee, WI, kicking-off robust field operations in each state. Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin will be critical to any effort to defeat Donald Trump, and Bloomberg is investing early and consistently from now through November to reach voters in ""the Blue Wall.""
In 2016, Trump won by less than a percentage point in each Blue Wall state. Out of millions of ballots cast, just 46,765 votes in Pennsylvania, 10,704 votes in Michigan, and 22,177 in Wisconsin earned Trump 46 crucial electoral votes which led him to victory.
""Today, we're opening offices in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee. We're also funding digital advertisements against Trump and will be registering voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In 2016, those states were supposed to be our 'blue wall' and we can't wait until the general election to start rebuilding it,"" said Bloomberg. ""The only way we're going to beat Trump in November is to run statewide campaigns in swing states starting right now, and that's exactly what we're doing.""
Mike Bloomberg at the Philadelphia Campaign Office for Mike Bloomberg 2020.
Building a national campaign with an unparalleled state structure, Mike Bloomberg 2020 has already hired an initial team in 20 states across the country with more to come. The initial team of now more than 200 staff embedded in states, supported by the headquarters team, will engage voters across the country while focusing on the delegate-rich March primary contests such as those that make up the Blue Wall.
Bloomberg is meeting with voters in each city, visiting small businesses and discussing pressing issues with community members. He is spending time in Philadelphia's Reading Market, Detroit's Avenue of Fashion, and the Milwaukee Public Market.

Today's events cap a week of state HQ and field office openings, putting brick and mortar dots on the national map and demonstrating Bloomberg's commitment to talking with voters in all parts of the country about the issues that matter to them — and running a national campaign to defeat Donald Trump. He opened five offices in five states, traveling to Charlotte, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee earlier in the week. Bloomberg has pledged to keep staff in key states through the 2020 General Election to defeat Donald Trump.
This week, he also announced his health care policy in Memphis, TN, emphasizing that every American should have access to affordable, high-quality care. The plan details his goals for improving the current system, where prescriptions cost too much. In Chillicothe, OH, Bloomberg met with community members to discuss the opioid epidemic and shared his plan for tackling it.
In every town Bloomberg visited, supporters said they believed he had something very special to offer America — proven leadership, the know-how to get things done, and the ability to defeat Donald Trump in November.

Sanders Campaign Press Release - Bernie 2020 Rolls Out Massive List of California Endorsements Ahead of Los Angeles Rally,2019-12-21T00:00:00+00:00,Bernie Sanders,/documents/sanders-campaign-press-release-bernie-2020-rolls-out-massive-list-california-endorsements,"
40 elected officials, more than 80 community leaders, and more than 200 academics throw their support behind Sen. Sanders
CALIFORNIA – Ahead of Sen. Sanders' rally in Los Angeles with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez today, 40 elected officials, more than 80 community leaders, and more than 200 academics in the Golden State announce their support behind Sen. Sanders' candidacy for President of the United States, demonstrating the growing momentum of the Bernie 2020 campaign in California.
The endorsements are in addition to 86 earlier endorsements from elected leaders, two major labor endorsements from National Nurses United and United Teachers Los Angeles, the grassroots network Bay Area Rising, the entire City Council of Coachella, and a statewide endorsement from the California Young Democrats.
""Having fought for the rights and dignity of working immigrant women for two decades, I trust Bernie Sanders to be a champion for justice for all of us,"" said Oakland City Councilmember Nikki Bas. ""Our nation needs a bold, principled leader who will end status quo politics and put the needs of everyday people before corporate profits. We must build a massive movement to win national rent control, deep investments in affordable housing, Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, immigration reform, and just alternatives to mass incarceration. I'm endorsing Bernie Sanders because he is building a movement to create a country that cares for all our families.""
""Bernie Sanders is the child of immigrants - people who worked hard and who struggled to make a life in this country,"" said Los Angeles City Councilmember Gil Cedillo. ""That is where he comes from, that is who he is. Bernie Sanders has been explicitly articulating every single thing that we have been fighting for our entire lives. I still stand behind my words that not since the Rainbow Coalition of 1988 have we seen such a diverse and progressive movement for the heart and soul of the Democratic Party under the leadership of Bernie Sanders. Our nation needs a revolutionary movement and there is no other viable candidate to carry out our agenda backed by our core values. I stood with Bernie in 2016, and I am even more proud to stand with him today, and endorse his candidacy as the next President of the United States.""
""We need a president who is committed to caring for the people of this country--from the men and women who bravely wore our nation's uniform to the young people who are sleeping on our streets,"" said Will Rodriguez-Kennedy, President of the California Young Democrats. ""Bernie Sanders has always fulfilled our moral obligation to lift up all Americans and give them the opportunities they deserve to thrive.""
""Bernie Sanders' prophetic call to love and compassion is finding an answering cry for justice, especially among those who have suffered too hard for too long,"" said Anna Harrison, Associate Professor of Theological Studies at Loyola Marymount University. ""His clarion cry, 'Not me. Us,' is our best hope for the future.""
""We are proud to have the endorsement of some of California's most progressive and dedicated elected officials, community leaders, and academics,"" said Rafael Návar, Bernie 2020 California State Director. ""We have the grassroots support we need to win this election, and with these leaders on our side, Bernie Sanders will become the next President of the United States.""

Trump Campaign Statement on Christianity Today Editorial,2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Donald J. Trump,/documents/trump-campaign-statement-christianity-today-editorial,"
""The impeachment proceedings brought on by the Democrats in the House have not only caused anger, but also further division among the American people. The media bias that has been apparent for the past three years has taken a dramatic turn to be even more divisive. I was outraged when I saw that Christianity Today – a publication that my grandfather founded – used his name to support their personal political agenda.
""President Trump has followed through on his promises made to the people of the United States. He has overcome historic opposition since day one of his term. However, he continues to work hard for the American people. He believes in this country. I believe he has been put in this position for a time such as this. He has had the courage to stand for things that no other man in his position has had the courage to do – protecting the U.S. Constitution and the belief of our forefathers that we are one nation under God; supporting our biggest ally in the Middle East, Israel; and appointing judges that will protect religious liberty. He is the only president in recent history that has stood up for the most vulnerable in our society – the unborn.
""I believe that we are called to honor those in authority. Today, I am praying fervently for President Trump, his family, his administration, and all of our leaders that are fighting for the US people. I continue to be thankful for President Trump's leadership and resilience when faced with hate and attacks from all sides.""

Sanders Campaign Press Release - Bernie Sanders Raises More Than a Million Dollars on Debate Day,2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Bernie Sanders,/documents/sanders-campaign-press-release-bernie-sanders-raises-more-than-million-dollars-debate-day,"
WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Friday announced that yesterday it raised more than a million dollars from tens of thousands of contributions – the best single debate day for the campaign all year.
""A lot of candidates on the debate stage last night worked hard to convince voters that our leaders must rely on super PACs funded by the wealthy and gather big checks in wine caves to beat Donald Trump in 2020,"" Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said. ""Bernie Sanders is proving them wrong every single day. Working class Americans know Bernie is going to stand with them when he's in the White House because he always has and they're saying it loudly by pitching in a few dollars when they can. Refusing to take cash from billionaires and CEOs is a key reason why the senator will earn the trust of voters and generate the enthusiasm needed to win the nomination, sweep Donald Trump out of the White House and create a political revolution to transform our country.""
The fundraising total and number of individual donations yesterday was the highest for Sanders' campaign during a debate day in 2019, which is just the latest sign of the momentum his campaign is seeing all over the country.

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter Named National Political Chair for Mike Bloomberg's 2020 Presidential Campaign,2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-former-philadelphia-mayor-michael-nutter-named-national,"
New York, New York – Today, Mike Bloomberg 2020 announced that former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter has been named National Political Chair to the campaign. Mayor Nutter served as the Mayor of Philadelphia for two terms from 2008-2016, and prior to that spent nearly 15 years on the Philadelphia City Council. He also served as President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors from 2012-2013.
Mayor Nutter will advise the campaign on policy development and strategy, and serve as a national surrogate on behalf of the campaign, recruiting key voices to join the campaign and traveling to field offices and events, speaking to constituents and press about why Mike Bloomberg is uniquely qualified to unite and rebuild the country at a time when it is more divided than ever.
""Mike Nutter knows that real leadership means delivering results for the people you serve, and I'm honored to have his support,"" said Mike Bloomberg. ""We share a belief in the power of government to unite people and get big things done. Mike was an innovative mayor who made one of America's biggest cities stronger and safer, and I've always appreciated his candor and counsel. While all the other Democratic candidates are focused on other states, we are building a campaign that can win critical battleground states — including Pennsylvania — and we are excited to have Mike on our leadership team.""
The announcement comes ahead of Mike Bloomberg's visit to Philadelphia on Saturday to open the first field office in Pennsylvania.
""Mike Bloomberg is my kind of leader,"" Mayor Nutter said. ""He cares about the drug crisis, gun violence, the environment, and access to high-quality healthcare for all Americans. But more than that – he's proven he can get things done on these issues for decades — as an entrepreneur, mayor and through his philanthropic efforts. Mike is a man with a plan. He's a doer. He won't let us down.""
During his mayoral tenure, Mayor Nutter lowered crime, improved educational attainment rates, made Philadelphia the greenest city in America, and attracted new businesses and residents to the city. He led an ethical and transparent government focused on providing high quality, efficient, and effective customer service. He brought the homicide rate down to a 50-year low, boosted high school and college degree rates, added hundreds of miles of bike lanes, launched the first low-income friendly bike share system in the country, and actively recruited businesses to open in Philadelphia. As President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, he strengthened federal-city relationships and promoted the development of effective national urban policy.
In 2011, Esquire magazine named Mayor Nutter to its Americans of the Year list and later in 2014, he was named Public Official of the Year by Governing magazine. During his tenure, Philadelphia received more than 150 awards for innovative programs, good government practices, and excellence.
Since leaving office, Mayor Nutter has remained active in public policy, civic engagement, education, and government across the country. He has been tapped by academic institutions to serve in a number of leadership and fellowship capacities including Columbia University, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. In 2019, Mayor Nutter was tapped to serve on the Board of Directors of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Council on Criminal Justice, and the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Donations Surge After Andrew Yang's Commanding Debate Performance,2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-donations-surge-after-andrew-yangs-commanding-debate,"
NEW YORK — Following Andrew Yang's commanding debate performance last night, the campaign raised $750,000 from 20,000 donations, a third of which came from new donors. The impressive haul adds to the over 350,000 grassroots donors to the Yang campaign, the vast majority of whom are small-dollar donors.
""The most important thing we can do over the coming weeks is make sure that Iowans and New Hampshirites are hearing Andrew's message. It's exciting that voters are seeing much more of Andrew in-person and on TV, but there's still more to be done — we've found that when voters truly listen to what Andrew has to say, they very quickly consider him as one of their top choices. His message, in conjunction with our strong ground-game, spell out tremendous upside for this campaign come February,"" said Campaign Chief Nick Ryan.
Today's fundraising feat comes on the heels of recent fundraising accomplishments, including the campaign's single largest 24-hour fundraising haul on November 30, when it raised nearly $750,000 online from more than 18,000 contributions.
Last week, the campaign raised $2 million from 65,000 contributions over 10 days while Andrew Yang met with nearly 1,600 Iowans during his first bus tour through the state.

"Klobuchar Campaign Press Release - What They Are Saying About Amyn Klobuchar at the Sixth Democratic Debate in Los Angeles, California",2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Amy Klobuchar,/documents/klobuchar-campaign-press-release-what-they-are-saying-about-amyn-klobuchar-the-sixth,"
The Reviews Are In: Klobuchar A Clear Winner At The Sixth Democratic Debate
LOS ANGELES, CA — After another standout performance last night from Senator Amy Klobuchar at the sixth Democratic presidential debate in California, numerous outlets, strategists, and media personalities praised her for her strong performance. CNN, Vox, The Daily Beast, Mother Jones, Newsweek, and USA Today all declared Senator Klobuchar as one of the night's winners, with The New York Times writing, ""There was no match for Ms. Klobuchar on Thursday when it came to the electability argument""and The Washington Post writing, ""Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was a standout, consistently strong and agile in her answers, positioning herself as having the capacity to be 'progressive and practical at the same time.'""
See what others are saying:
CNN: ""WINNERS: Amy Klobuchar: The Minnesota senator benefited the most from the smaller number of candidates on stage. She got to talk a LOT more than in past debates and used that time very, very well. She started strong -- outshining her competitors with her answer on how to convince the public that the impeachment was the right move. Time and time again in answer after answer, Klobuchar drove home her basic message: I'm from the Midwest. I'm a woman. I get things done. And, she effectively took it to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg over his dismissiveness of service in the Senate. An excellent debate performance when Klobuchar really needed one.""
The Daily Beast: ""Amy Klobuchar Seizes Her Debate Moment, Crushes It""
The New York Times: ""There was no match for Ms. Klobuchar on Thursday when it came to the electability argument.""
The Washington Post: ""Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was a standout, consistently strong and agile in her answers, positioning herself as having the capacity to be ""progressive and practical at the same time."" While she has been slow gaining traction in the polls, I continue to think that Klobuchar is the candidate most likely to pull off a surprisingly strong showing in Iowa.""
Vox: ""Amy Klobuchar deserves a closer look from electability-minded Democrats""
USA Today: Winners: Amy Klobuchar: Klobuchar strategically acted as a peacekeeper a few times Thursday, touting her Midwestern roots by stopping a few word-battles between other candidates on stage with a ""come on, you guys."" She then seamlessly dovetailed into her own stance on the issue.
Newsweek: ""Klobuchar found her voice as a moderate candidate with a more relaxed and assured debate performance.""
Politico: ""Klobuchar busts out""
Boston Globe: ""Amy Klobuchar's big night on the Democratic presidential debate stage""
McClatchy: ""KLOBUCHAR HAS A NIGHT: Amy Klobuchar has consistently performed well in debates, but the game she brought to Los Angeles was unquestionably her best yet. The Minnesota senator owned the first 30 minutes with crisp, detailed answers from how an effective impeachment trial should proceed to leaping at a contrast with Sanders over the bipartisan renegotiated North American trade deal, which she supports.""
Vox: Winner: Amy Klobuchar: A very different Amy Klobuchar was standing on the debate stage Thursday...In her place was a confident Klobuchar who was in a groove all night, with personal anecdotes, quippy one liners about ""wind caves,"" a snappy moment telling Pete Buttigieg to respect the experience of his fellow candidates onstage, and clear, substantive responses to policy questions.
Wall Street Journal: ""Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar came out swinging and landed her punches. Her lengthy exchange with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg over experience was the first time the debates have gotten below the surface-level questions about age and health. She also showcased her ability to combine humor and sharp words to draw effective contrasts.""
TIME: ""Iowa will be the first state in the nation to cast ballots for a Democratic nominee, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar leaned into that fact during Thursday's debate. ""The way we take on climate change in a big way is by talking about what's happening on the coast as I just did,"" the Minnesota lawmaker said, ""but also by talking about what's happening in the midwest — where I'm from. It's not flyover country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding."" In her answers, she was more determined than ever to reach midwestern and other blue collar workers, many of which have seen their farm bankruptcies increase by 25% in one year, and extreme rain increase by 50% since 1900.""
FOX 9: ""Amy Klobuchar gets some spotlight in Dem debate""
Mother Jones: ""Amy Klobuchar seemed like the big winner, relatively speaking. She got plenty of speaking time, she was clearer than usual in her answers, and she did the best job by far of selling a moderate vision without directly attacking Warren or Sanders.""
NBC News: ""Klobuchar claims moderate, Midwest bona fides""
New York Magazine: ""A candidate who really needed a good debate, Amy Klobuchar, got a lot of airtime and sounded animated and fluid, if a bit over the top in advertising her down-home midwestern humor.""
Star Tribune: ""Sen. Amy Klobuchar turns up volume at debate: 'The president is not the king'""
MSNBC: ""Sen. Amy Klobuchar: ""I know how to win"" statewide and in red districts""
NAACP: Thank you @amyklobuchar for raising voting rights. We agree. ""You shouldn't lose your right to vote. Let's stop the purging. Let's stop the gerrymandering."" #DemocraticDebate
Tommy Vietor: Klobuchar is having a night
Vanita Gupta: Sen. @amyklobuchar is right: There are forces in America trying to make it harder to vote – and states across the country are attempting to aggressively purge voters from the rolls. Voting should NOT be a use it or lose it right. The voter purges need to end now. #DemDebate
Frida Ghitis: Klobuchar has been very good all along. Not surprising the field is thinning and she's quietly holding on.
Maria Shriver: @amyklobuchar is smart, strong, and on her game tonight. She has midwest credentials and Washington experience. #DemDebate
Josh Rogin: Klobuchar just won the Warren-Mayor Pete battle.
Matt Viser: This is Amy Klobuchar's best debate. By far.
Carla Marinucci: Winner: @AmyKlobuchar's best debate yet; used humor to expand on key positons & argue for electibility. Close 2nd: @PeteButtigieg under attack, kept bouncing back. @BernieSanders, @Ewarren, @JoeBiden, no harm/no foul. @AndrewYang refreshing, @TomSteyer showed passion. #DemDebate
Jonathan Tamari: Klobuchar the first one to directly answer without falling back to her standard stump speech""
Charlotte Clymer: Amy Klobuchar is the only one who has directly answered this question, so far. #DemDebate
Nicholas Thompson: How will you get more people to agree with you on impeachment? Biden, Pete, Warren, Sanders: tell them again that Trump is bad. Klobuchar: Actually break down the case in a smart way so they understand.
Pod Save America: Asked what next steps are on impeachment, Sen. @amyklobuchar calls for McConnell let witnesses testify in the Senate trial. #DemDebate WE ARE FEELING THIS ANSWER.
Allison Winn Scotch: Senator @amyklobuchar is coming out as confident as she has ever been at a debate. Very strong. Presidential.
Jennifer Rubin: Klobuchar global Watergate and her shout out to Iowa farmers were winners.
Kayla Jardine: Klobuchar is having a good night and the audience is recognizing her!! The most comfortable I've seen her on stage #DemDebate
Greg Sargent: .@amyklobuchar: Day 1: Rejoin Paris climate deal. Day 2: Restore regs on power plants. Day 3: Restore regs on tailpipe emissions. Followed by: Price on carbon. Good and clear.
Randi Weingarten: Strong start from @amyklobuchar: ""The President is not King in America. The law is King."" #DemDebate #AFTvotes
Christina Reynolds: ""The way we tackle this election is by winning big in the election."" Amen @amyklobuchar. And we need to win in all the races, not just the big one.
Jennifer Rubin: Klobuchar doesn't give the same answer in every debate so she sounds fresh and you are actually interested in what she has to say.
Shannon Fisher: I'm impressed with Klobuchar's debate performances. She is a straight-talking, clear-headed, consistent, intelligent, positive candidate with an air of sincerity. If her hair would just stop trembling, I think Amy Klobuchar would be a STRONG contender against Trump! #DemDebate
Jamelle Bouie: oh and before we get too far from it, klobuchar's answer on voting rights was great""
Julian Zelizer: The smaller stage, combined with some very good moderators, has offered many of the candidates, such as @amyklobuchar, an opportunity to showcase their talent in ways that have been difficult until now.
Grace Segers: Amy Klobuchar is also having a good night. Her performance is actually reminding me of her questioning of Brett Kavanaugh — not necessarily in tone, but because she is confident in herself and in her values in a way she hasn't fully embodied in previous debates.
Daily Kos: Klobuchar makes a call back to the immigration package championed, and almost passed, by Ted Kennedy. Nice piece of personal history. She's having a strong showing tonight. #DemDebate
Holly Figueroa O'Reilly: Klobuchar is having her best debate yet. #DemDebate
Adrienne Elrod: Damn @amyklobuchar just keeps getting better and better during these debates!

Klobuchar Campaign Press Release - Amy Klobuchar Campaign Raises More Than $1 Million in 24 Hours After December Debate,2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Amy Klobuchar,/documents/klobuchar-campaign-press-release-amy-klobuchar-campaign-raises-more-than-1-million-24,"
MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Tonight the Amy for America campaign announced that it received more than $1 million in the 24 hours following the sixth Democratic presidential debate in California. The campaign surged in online support with more than 5,500 new website signups and received contributions from thousands of grassroots donors after Amy's winning performance.
""On last night's debate stage, Amy Klobuchar proved that she is the candidate who can take on Donald Trump and help Democrats win big up and down the ballot,"" said Amy for America Campaign Manager Justin Buoen. ""Her message is resonating with Americans who are looking for a President who can bring people together and deliver real results. In the 24 hours following the debate, we have raised more than $1 million, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses. We will continue to build a strong grassroots operation to win in the primary and take on Donald Trump in the general.""
Today, Klobuchar kicked off her For All of America bus tour which includes stops in 27 counties across Iowa in four days. With the release of the DNC debate qualifications this morning, Klobuchar is one of five candidates qualified for the seventh Democratic presidential debate in January.

Statement by Elizabeth Warren - My Plan to Create 10.6 Million Green Jobs,2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Elizabeth Warren,/documents/statement-elizabeth-warren-my-plan-create-106-million-green-jobs,"
By Elizabeth Warren
Earlier this month, climate scientists published new research suggesting the planet is hurtling towards an ecological tipping point that would irreversibly damage the earth and threaten our livable climate — for good. This most recent study adds to the growing body of evidence that climate change is happening faster than scientists originally thought. And it further reinforces what we already know: we have roughly a decade left to avoid catastrophic impacts by ending our economic dependence on fossil fuels and substantially reducing global emissions.
But while climate change presents an urgent threat, it also presents the greatest opportunity of our time: the chance to rebuild our economy with 100% clean energy, to address the racial and economic inequality embedded in our fossil fuel economy, and to create millions of good, union jobs in the process.
This is not the first time our country has faced a threat of this magnitude.
When Franklin Delano Roosevelt said we would build a historic air force of 185,000 planes to defeat the Nazis, America had a nascent military aircraft industry. But FDR rallied the nation to the task: by the end of World War II, we had produced around 300,000 aircraft in less than 5 years.
When John F. Kennedy told the nation that we would send a man to the moon in under a decade, people said that would be impossible, too. But our top scientists and engineers came together and changed the world forever, delivering not just a lunar landing but also a torrent of new technology that helped working Americans here at home.
From World War II to the space race, American ingenuity has risen to meet seemingly impossible challenges — leading the world and unleashing economic benefits for Americans in the process.
Today we face a new challenge. Defeating the climate crisis will require the ingenuity of the moon landing and an economic and industrial mobilization unseen since our efforts in World War II. It will need to happen at the speed and scale of FDR's New Deal, which launched over 50 federal programs and pulled millions of Americans out of unemployment. It will take workers of all kinds to rebuild and repower our energy grid and to upgrade our transportation, building, and water systems to guard against the worst effects of climate change and protect our most vulnerable communities. And it will take workers in every corner of America — from construction foremen in the Rust Belt to pipefitters in the Bayou — to transform our country's infrastructure.
The Green New Deal is the answer to this national call.
After the 2008 crash, President Obama ushered through the historic American Reinvestment and Recovery Act to jumpstart our economy and bring an end to the Great Recession. Included in this total federal investment was $90 billion for clean energy, making it one of the largest investments in clean energy in U.S. history. The Council of Economic Advisors later reported that every $1 invested in clean energy leveraged an additional $1.60 in non-federal and private dollars.
Using this historical data and other estimates as a guide, my plans for a Green New Deal will result in an estimated total public and private investment of $10.7 trillion in our new clean energy economy. And independent experts that examined my ideas for a Green New Deal to analyze how they will drive job creation estimated that they will create 10.6 million new green jobs. This will help rebuild the middle class by providing family-supporting wages, career pathways, and worker protections in our new green economy.
This is the opportunity of the Green New Deal: a $10.7 trillion total investment in our clean economy that spurs 10.6 million green new jobs. And we'll do it all together — with no community and no worker left behind.
I mean it when I say that defeating the climate crisis will be a top priority of my administration. That's why today I'm releasing my plan to enact a climate change agenda that not only reduces our carbon emissions but also jumpstarts our economy.
Developing the Green Workforce of the Future
There are already clean energy job opportunities across the country. But with $10.7 trillion in federal and private investments, we can turn these opportunities into 10.6 million new, union jobs rebuilding our nation's infrastructure and transitioning to the new clean energy economy. To support the millions of skilled and experienced contractors we will need to plan and execute large construction and engineering projects in the new clean economy and to support the first responders, healthcare workers, social workers, and other public and private employees who respond to climate-induced disasters, my administration will commit to investments in retraining, joint labor management apprenticeships, and creating strong career pipelines to ensure a continuous supply of skilled, available workers. And, we will look for every opportunity to partner with high schools and vocational schools to build pathways to the middle class for kids who opt not to go to college.
Expanding job training
We currently invest $200 million annually in apprenticeship programs across the country. Successfully training and re-training millions of skilled laborers to rebuild our nation's infrastructure, however, will require scaling up dramatically. That's why my plan to Defend and Create American Jobs calls for a tenfold increase in investments in apprenticeships — a $20 billion commitment over the next ten years. I'll follow Governor Inslee's lead by re-establishing dedicated programs for green industrial and construction job training and placement under the Workforce Innovation & Opportunity Act (WIOA), too.
And investing in job training is only the first step. A Warren administration will link public investments in clean energy infrastructure to apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship training, as well as graduation rates and local hires, to ensure that we are creating a full training-to-career pipeline. My plans also call for expanded technical and trade school opportunities to create pathways into good jobs in the new clean energy economy that will not require a college degree. And my administration will create regional sector-specific training partnerships to help better align training with the local job market, leverage the community college system, and ensure that workers gain transferable skills.
Partnering with unions to rebuild the middle class
I am committed to ensuring that all of the 10.6 million new jobs in the clean economy pull working Americans back into the middle class — and to working hand-in-hand with unions to do so. That's why I will fight for good wages and strong benefits for every worker that joins the new clean economy. A Warren administration will condition federal clean energy investments to state, local, and tribal governments on employers offering family-supporting wages and benefits — and will enforce this through Project Labor Agreements, prevailing wage laws, and Community Benefit Agreements. And I will work hand-in-hand with unions to return power to the working people powering the green economy. Unions built the middle class and unions will rebuild the middle class in the green economy of the future, too.
I've already committed to making sweeping reforms to our labor policy. These changes will extend labor rights to all workers — for example, narrowing the definition of “supervisor” under the National Labor Relations Act to end the exclusion of workers like the construction foremen that will lead the charge on building our clean energy grids. They will guarantee workers entering this new economy have a voice in actually shaping it by strengthening organizing and collective bargaining rights and increasing worker choice and control, including by requiring large companies to allow workers to elect no less than 40% of board members. And I will work with unions to design the training and apprenticeship programs that can create strong career pipelines for workers to enter this new green economy, helping to expand opportunities — and a continuous supply of skilled workers to power this transformation.
Ensuring the new clean economy is open to everyone
In addition to employing millions of new workers in the clean economy, I am committed to leaving no worker behind as we transition to an economy powered on clean energy. That includes honoring our commitments to fossil fuel workers by holding fossil fuel companies accountable and defending worker pensions, benefits, and securing retirements. I will make sure the opportunities created are available to those who have traditionally been excluded — especially women and communities of color — by imposing new rules on companies that hope to receive federal contracts.
Rebuilding our nation's infrastructure as part of the new clean energy economy will take all of us, including returning citizens — which is why my administration will partner with organizations that make renewable energy and associated job training available to underserved communities and formerly incarcerated individuals. And my plan to empower workers will expand worker safety protections for workers entering the green economy — like our transit workers who are increasingly subject to assault — and I will strengthen anti-discrimination protections for workers from all backgrounds.
Repowering our Energy Sector
In 2018, clean energy industries employed over 3.2 million Americans — more workers than in the petroleum, natural gas and coal industries combined. The clean energy industry is rapidly expanding — the two fastest-growing jobs in the nation are solar panel installer and wind turbine technician. But there is more to do, and the federal government can and should play a role in increasing the speed and scale of this transition. A Warren administration will focus on rebuilding and repowering our energy grid to grow our economy — and my plans will create 6.8 million good paying jobs in the energy sector, all while cutting carbon pollution.
100% Clean Energy Plan
While some states and utilities have been leading the way on cleaning up their electricity sources, far too many are falling behind. My plan calls for the federal government to set a bold standard for achieving 100% carbon-neutral power by 2030, including carbon-free baseload solutions, putting us on the path to a 100% emissions-free electricity supply by 2035.
These ambitious targets will require us to ramp up renewable energy generation and deployment dramatically. Cleaning up our energy system will create a diverse range of jobs — from construction worker to electrician to project manager. But these good paying jobs won't just be in renewable energy. They will also come from making homes, offices, and industries more energy efficient. And through my Green Manufacturing plan, we'll jumpstart American research and manufacturing in areas like battery storage, which will require a whole new set of skills and laborers. And wherever possible, we'll invest in modernizing our grid with American-made materials, spurring still more jobs right here at home.
Offshore Wind Jobs
Right now, there is only one offshore wind project operating in this country — Rhode Island's Block Island Wind Farm. It's clear that today, we are failing to make use of the clean, powerful energy resource that lies just off our coasts. My Blue New Deal For Our Oceans plan will jumpstart the offshore wind industry. Bringing these offshore wind projects to life will generally require the help of workers from more than 70 different occupations — from machinists to engineers, sailors to ironworkers, electricians to longshoremen. By 2030, offshore wind energy development from Maryland to Maine could support more than 36,000 full time jobs. And even after they're built, we will need workers to operate and service the turbines. My Blue New Deal also calls for electrifying and shoring up our ports, creating additional jobs throughout our coastal communities.
Restarting Our Transportation Sector
America's transportation and trucking industry accounts for more than 10 million direct jobs, with over 3 million truck drivers alone. But right now, transportation also accounts for the largest portion of U.S. carbon pollution. Moreover, our public transportation infrastructure is crumbling: the American Society of Civil Engineers gave our roads a “D” grade on their most recent infrastructure report card, with one out of every five miles of highway pavement in poor condition.
For too long, our government has failed to invest in critical infrastructure — and unless we take action, poor conditions will continue to plague one of our most important industries. But this, too, is an opportunity: as we rebuild our crumbling transportation infrastructure, we can build in climate resiliency, and create a transportation system powered by electricity rather than fossil fuels. The massive project of investing in our transportation infrastructure will affect every state and county in the nation, creating about 2.6 million jobs in the public and private sector.
Build Green Program
Public transportation is a $71 billion industry that employs more than 430,000 people. And yet, 45% of Americans still do not have access to public transportation, leaving those without access reliant on car ownership to get to work, school and worship. We know that increasing public transportation rates and decreasing vehicle miles traveled is one of the best ways to reduce emissions. That's why I'm proposing a new Build Green program, which would establish a new grant program to electrify public buses, school buses, rail, cars, and fleet vehicles that is modeled after the Department of Transportation's BUILD grant program. This program will be paid for by closing corporate loopholes, and will open up new funding opportunities for states, cities, counties and tribal governments to expand and electrify public transportation options. A study conducted in the Twin Cities found Black, Asian-American, and Latinx commuters have longer commutes than white commuters. And people with disabilities face particular barriers in using and accessing public transportation. These investments will be crucial to ensuring equitable and accessible transportation for all.
100% Clean Vehicles
Demand for passenger electric vehicles is growing at home and abroad — but even though more and more people want electric vehicles, they still only account for around 1% of vehicles on the road. To spur auto manufacturing in this space, I have put forward a bold and ambitious goal to require all new light -and medium-duty vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero emission vehicles. We'll achieve this goal by investing in a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. By the end of the first term of a Warren administration, there will be a charging station at every rest stop in America. And this nation-wide network of charging infrastructure will begin to lay the groundwork for electrifying long-haul trucking, too.
But charging station infrastructure is only half the battle. Right now, consumers don't have enough access to vehicles. In 2011, there were only two mass market electric vehicles available to consumers — and even now, the auto industry offers only fifteen models. While car manufacturers are already trying to meet growing demand, my investment in clean energy technology, including products designed for use in the electric vehicle supply chain, will further increase adoption of electric vehicles by making it easier for auto manufacturers to build the vehicles that consumers want.
We've let our failure to take action destroy our transportation infrastructure for too long and a Warren administration will make sure that the Department of Transportation acts with the speed and scale necessary to address the climate challenges ahead of us. I will take executive action to require the Department of Transportation set performance management rules that require federal transportation investments to be accompanied by life-cycle analysis and reduction strategies for climate and other transportation related pollution.
Renewing Our Water Infrastructure
America's water infrastructure is crumbling. The government's failure to invest is putting Americans in danger in two ways: first, our levees, dams and inland waterways infrastructure are all at risk — and will only become more stressed by climate change as sea-level rise, extreme flooding, and drought all become more frequent and severe. Second, our drinking water is increasingly at risk: as the infrastructure supporting it crumbles, an estimated 77 million Americans live with tap water that violates federal safe water standards — and this number does not even include the millions more served by very small water systems or private domestic wells. Meanwhile, more and more Americans struggle to afford their water bills as water bill costs have risen at more than double the rate of inflation over the last 20 years. Fixing our water infrastructure is an urgent priority — but we risk not having enough hands on deck, as the water sector's aging workforce increasingly enters into retirement. Reinvesting in our nation's water infrastructure isn't just essential for the health and the safety of our communities, it's also a chance to grow our workforce. In a Warren administration, we'll not only protect Americans by rebuilding our nation's water infrastructure — we'll also create about 190,000 thousand good, union jobs in the process.
Rebuilding America's dams, levees, and inland waterways
Our nation's dams, levees, and inland waterways provide necessary infrastructure for shipping and hydroelectric power — but they've been so underfunded that they are putting our communities at risk. When the Oroville Dam's emergency spillway failed in 2017, nearly 200,000 people were evacuated from rural Northern California. And the failure of New Orleans' levees during Hurricane Katrina made Katrina one of the most devastating U.S. hurricane on record, killing 1,800 people, damaging 70% of homes in New Orleans, and resulting in damages of $125 billion. This stops now. A Warren administration will triple the US Army Corps of Engineers' annual budget so that they have the resources they need to upgrade our water infrastructure and defend our vulnerable communities from harm. We'll pay for this with savings from my plan to transition the military away from its dependence on fossil fuels and other internal Department of Defense funding shifts. This dramatic expansion will create new opportunities for good, federal jobs as we update critical infrastructure across the nation — an investment that is more important than ever to defend vulnerable front-line communities from more frequent and more severe weather events.
Ensuring safe drinking water for all
Nearly a decade ago the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recognizing access to water and sanitation as basic human rights. But today, the United States is in the middle of a dangerous drinking water crisis. Not only do an estimated 77 million Americans' have tap water that violated federal standards, but at least 2 million Americans still don't have access to running water. And because of a long legacy of unfair, racist, and deliberate policy choices, communities of color are disproportionately likely to lack access to safe, affordable drinking water. After decades of declining federal investments in safe water, it's time to invest in safe, affordable water for our communities. That's why I have committed to fully capitalizing federal programs that fund drinking water capital infrastructure, such as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. And I will go further by supporting Rep. Joe Kennedy's Affordable Safe Drinking Water Act, which would extend the horizon for states and localities to repay revolving loans and expand the funding to cover the installation of lead and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) filtering systems and remediation measures. These important updates to the State Revolving Fund programs will not only guarantee much-needed upgrades to our drinking water infrastructure, but will also spur necessary investments to allow for expanded job opportunities. My administration will continue to invest in brownfield remediation, which is why I have proposed to reinstate and then triple the Superfund Tax to ensure that we protect our communities from the legacy of environmental harm and we put people to work in the process. And I will remain committed to standing with communities across the country that are impacted by lead.
Jobs in the water sector are wide ranging: there are more than 200 different occupations, including in skilled trades, administration, and finance. What's more, because every community needs quality water, these jobs exist across the nation. I will work to create more inclusive career paths for water workers to meet the needs of our drinking water infrastructure by fighting for increases in the percent of local hires and minority/women-owned contracts that are awarded as part of water-related government contracting. And I will work with Congress to fully fund the EPA's Brownfields Environmental Workforce Development and Job Training Grants Program and the Environmental Health Sciences Environmental Career Worker Training Program, which is helping to improve workforce development for water-related careers. Lastly and in order to confront America's drinking water crisis head on, I will take executive action to develop a national inter-agency safe and affordable drinking water roadmap. And to inform this effort I will convene a Water Equity Advisory Council with representation from key environmental justice and community-based organizations that are on the frontlines of addressing our safe water crisis.
Rebuilding our Homes, Buildings and Schools
In his Second Inaugural Address, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that the “test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.” Later that term, FDR signed into law the Wagner-Steagall Housing Act, which put Americans to work building new, modern affordable housing units across the country. But today, whether it's a leaky window, an old appliance, or mold in a home, it's hard-working Americans that pay the price through increased utility bills and housing costs.
As I've outlined in my 100% Clean Energy Plan, I'll work with states and local governments to develop and implement new and stronger building codes to reach zero-carbon emissions and building those new standards into federal grant requirements, tax credits, and mortgage products. And I'll launch an initiative to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings, with the goal of upgrading 4% of buildings a year until the job is done. All told, my plans will create over 970,000 thousand new jobs as demand grows across sectors from the manufacturing of American-made energy efficient materials to large and small-scale construction efforts.
Safe and affordable housing
We currently have a government that has paid lip service to the idea of providing all Americans in need with safe and affordable housing. The federal government hasn't funded new public housing construction in decades and has turned a blind eye to the massive maintenance backlog needed to make sure the limited housing we do have is safe to live in. That stops now. My Affordable Housing Plan would invest $500 billion over 10 years to address this crisis and would create 3 million new housing units. As a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, I recognize the right to safe, affordable housing for every American and the need for new, green jobs to realize FDR's dream. My Green Public Housing program will build on the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, by raising living standards and providing the financial assistance necessary to retrofit these homes. This will require training a new American workforce and would alone create 240,000 new jobs. We can address the climate crisis while we tackle the housing crisis, too.
Providing our children with healthy learning and living environments
As a former public school teacher, I know firsthand how our children's learning can be affected by their environment. More than half of our public schools need repairs in order to be in “good” condition. Our poor school infrastructure has serious effects on the health and academic outcomes of students and on the well-being of teachers and staff. That's why in my K-12 plan I've committed at least an additional $50 billion to improving our school infrastructure. This will require a workforce across the country to identify the schools most in need and carry out the necessary upgrades to provide our children with the learning environment they deserve. There's nothing more important to me than investing in our kids because it means we're investing in our future.
Green infrastructure means inclusive infrastructure. We have to recognize that our building infrastructure crisis is an environmental justice crisis. The disparities in our building infrastructure reflect the racial inequities that exist in America today. Historically, redlining denied entire groups of people — primarily communities of color — the chance to live in neighborhoods of their choice while also making them the victims of environmental racism. Studies have shown that low-income and minority children bear the brunt of poisoning from lead-based paint and failing lead pipes in older housing units. Our system has also failed Americans with disabilities who occupy 41% of our public housing units and yet only 3% of those units are ADA accessible. These same inequities exist in our public schools, too. In New York City, for example, 83% of elementary schools in New York City are not fully accessible to students with disabilities.
This ends in a Warren administration. It's the job of our government to reverse these injustices, and I will put Americans to work to finish the job. That's why I will use the full force of the federal government to invest in addressing these disparities — and creating millions of good, union jobs in the process.Together, these plans will curb homelessness in America, put Americans to work in quality jobs, protect the health of American families, and ease the burden on their pocketbooks.
Financing the Green Jobs Plan
Defeating the climate crisis and transitioning our economy to run on 100% clean energy will take big, structural change. That's why my plans will result in $10.7 trillion in federal and non- federal funding to fight for a Green New Deal — backed up by detailed plans laying out exactly how we will use those dollars — to address the size of this crisis.
The transition to clean energy is an opportunity to transform our economy, creating new industries, like in zero-emissions building construction, and greatly expanding others, like electric vehicle manufacturing, at a speed and scale not seen since World War II — and creating huge opportunities for state, local and non-federal investment in the process, too. My Administration will create new financing tools to unlock state, local, and private investment and direct it towards meaningful investments that tackle climate change, produce jobs, and reduce inequality. And my administration will put in place strong protections to ensure that this $10.7 trillion commitment flows to the right places, so that our climate investments benefit all Americans — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
A New Green Bank
A Green Bank is among the best ways to ensure a dedicated funding stream for an economy-wide climate transition to reconcile the scale of investment required with the speed of transition necessary to defeat the climate crisis. I'll work with Congress to establish a bank modeled after and expanded upon the National Climate Bank Act, introduced earlier this year by my friend and colleague Senator Markey. We'll put in place strong bipartisan oversight and governance to ensure that investments are equitable and benefit working Americans. And ultimately, this new Green Bank will mobilize $1 trillion in climate and green infrastructure investments across the country over 30 years.
The Green Bank will open up new markets for greater investment by working alongside existing federal authorities through direct spending, grants, and loans. It will provide security for investors looking for climate-friendly investments in mid- to large-scale infrastructure projects that serve the public interest but might not otherwise attract private capital due to risk-return thresholds, payback horizons, credit risk or other factors. It will increase the overall scale of clean energy investment and the pace of substitution of clean energy technologies for fossil-fuel based technologies, while also protecting consumers by keeping energy prices low and ensuring compliance with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's regulations. And it will expand opportunities for communities and the private sector by directing funds toward communities on the front lines of the climate crisis that have traditionally been left out of investment opportunities.
Green Victory Bonds
Today many states have green bonds programs, using the proceeds to fund land use projects, river and habitat preservation, and energy and water infrastructure. Green bonds have also surged in popularity worldwide, with sales growing 46% last year to about a total of about $460 billion.
While the federal government has never issued a green bond, the World War II-era “Victory Bond” program was a major success, raising $185 billion — over $2 trillion in 2012 dollars — and four out of five American households bought Victory Bonds. I'll propose a “Green Victory Bond,” backed by the full-faith and credit of the United States by the Treasury Department, to finance the transition to a green economy. These Green Victory Bonds will be sold at levels that allow Americans across the socioeconomic spectrum the opportunity to own a piece of the climate solution, and to benefit from the new green economy that we build together.
America has a long and proud history of rising to the challenges that have faced this country — and defeating the climate crisis is no exception. A Warren administration will ensure that as we fight climate change, each and every American benefits from the opportunities created by the clean economy — especially the 10.6 million workers who will power our transition to 100% clean energy.

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg Campaign Opens Tennessee Headquarters,2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-campaign-opens-tennessee-headquarters,"
Nashville, Tennessee — Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg visited Nashville today to open the Tennessee headquarters for his 2020 campaign. The office is the campaign's first field office in Tennessee.
Nashville Mayor John Cooper and Bloomberg sat down for coffee prior to the opening. They discussed highlights from Bloomberg's health care policy that he released earlier in the day.
The Nashville headquarters is located in Saint Cloud Corner at the corner of 5th Avenue on Church Street. Twelve staffers are focusing on building campaign and field operations across the state of Tennessee, with a staff that will continue to grow in the coming weeks.
""Unfortunately, of all 50 states, Tennessee has one of the highest rates of uninsured Americans. We've just got to do something about that,"" said Bloomberg at the office opening. ""This is a country that is wealthy, this is a country that we think is compassionate. And to leave people without the ability when they don't feel well to go to a doctor, or if there is something really wrong to get treatment, is just something that we should never tolerate. This morning in Memphis, I announced a health care plan which I think is practical, I think has a decent chance of getting it through Congress, because if you don't have those two things it's just pie in the sky and we're wasting our time and it's just hot air.""
Bloomberg announced his new health care policy in Memphis, outlining achievable reforms that will increase access to coverage and reduce costs for all Americans. Bloomberg will create a public insurance option, similar to Medicare, that everyone will be able to enroll in.
""The Affordable Care Act was actually a major achievement that took us in the right direction, and President Obama deserves an awful lot of credit for that,"" said Bloomberg. ""But now we have to finish the job, and we have to make sure that every person in America has access to coverage and affordable care.""
Tennessee is one of several key states voting on Super Tuesday. Bloomberg is leading a uniquely national campaign to win the Democratic nomination and defeat President Trump in November. The campaign will continue to open field offices across the country in the next few weeks.
Bloomberg's Tennessee team will be led by State Director Courtney Wheeler. Wheeler is a veteran political strategist in the state and was the campaign manager for Karl Dean's gubernatorial run last year.

Booker Campaign Press Release - Cory 2020 Will Air First TV Ad During Democratic Debate,2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Cory Booker,/documents/booker-campaign-press-release-cory-2020-will-air-first-tv-ad-during-democratic-debate,"
""Together"" Will Air on Cable in Early States, Select National Markets
Targeted Specifically at Debate Watchers, Ad Is Opening Salvo in Cory 2020's Announced TV Advertising Campaign
Newark, NJ — Cory 2020's first television ad will run today during the Democratic debate.
In the 30-second spot, titled ""Together"" and targeted specifically at Democrats tuning in to the debate tonight, Cory Booker notes that although he will not be on the December debate stage, he will still win the election by bringing people together in common cause and common purpose to tackle big challenges.
""Together"" is the first part of a $500,000 down payment on television and digital advertising aimed at convincing voters to support Cory Booker that the campaign announced last week.
Cory 2020 will run the new ad on cable TV in 22 markets nationwide, including the four early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina -- and New York, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. The ad will run during the debate, which is being broadcast by PBS and simulcast on CNN.
This weekend, nine Democratic presidential candidates, including every candidate on the December debate stage, urged the DNC to rethink the January debate qualification thresholds to ensure that the debate stage includes all viable candidates and fully reflects the diversity of the Democratic Party.
The debate qualification thresholds for the January debate have not yet been announced, but four public polls released in the past 10 days have shown Booker at four percent or higher in support, including three state-level polls (in Iowa, South Carolina, and Wisconsin). No state-level debate qualifying polls were released between the November debate and the December debate qualifying deadline.
Since the November debate, Cory 2020 has seen a surge in financial support and interest from voters in early states. After traveling to Nevada yesterday, Booker will spend the next five days in Iowa, launching a bus tour of the state tomorrow and hosting a flurry of events across the state.
Cory 2020's new 30-second television ad can be viewed HERE:
Below is a transcript of the ad:
BOOKER: How long are these things? 30 seconds? Are you sure we can afford this?
You're only gonna see this ad once because I'm not a billionaire. I won't be on tonight's debate stage, but that's okay because I'm going to win this election anyway. This election isn't about who can spend the most, or who slings the most mud. It's about the people. It's about all of us, standing together, fighting together. Not just to beat Donald Trump, but to bring about the transformative change we need.

Patrick Campaign Press Release - Deval Patrick Announces Policy Agenda for 2020 Campaign,2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Deval Patrick,/documents/patrick-campaign-press-release-deval-patrick-announces-policy-agenda-for-2020-campaign,"
Releases Platform Centered on Four Policy Pillars: Opportunity, Reform, Democracy, and Foreign Policy
BOSTON, MA - Today Governor Patrick unveiled a policy agenda for his 2020 campaign. The agenda, posted on Medium, is made up of four main pillars: opportunity, reform, democracy, and foreign policy. Following today's rollout, Governor Patrick will travel to Manchester, New Hampshire, where he will discuss his agenda with voters at a roundtable discussion. Throughout January, Governor Patrick will hold four events across the country, each of which will focus on one of the four pillars.
""My platform recognizes that real people don't live their lives in policy silos, but rather at the intersection of a number of policy and personal choices."" Governor Patrick said. ""I developed these agendas based on my own lived experience as a kid on the Southside of Chicago, as a civil rights lawyer, a private citizen working in business, and as Governor driving change at the level where policy impacts people.""
The platform focuses on four main agendas-- an Opportunity Agenda to grow the economy, create better jobs, create wealth for more people in more places, and create wealth for the country to reduce the national debt; a Reform Agenda to fix the country's big systems, including health care, immigration, criminal justice, and tax systems, so that they align with the nation's values and enable people to reach for their American Dream; a Democracy Agenda to enable the American democracy to serve all people, not just the powerful and the well connected; and a Leadership Agenda to rebuild the United States' power and influence in the world.
As a whole, Governor Patrick's vision for the country focuses on renewing the American Dream for everyone, everywhere-- ensuring that every single person in the United States has an equal shot at obtaining success. Among other things, the agenda advocates for creating a national service program that would grant participants tuition-free higher education in return for participation, sets out a three-part plan for promoting broad-based economic mobility, and establishes a vision for U.S. foreign policy based on the strength of enduring American values. Further, specific policy details will be released with each of the rollouts.
Today, Governor Patrick will spend part of the afternoon in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he will hold a roundtable with New Hampshire voters. He will speak with New Hampshire residents about the issues that impact them and speak about his policy platform as it relates to their lives. Next month, Governor Patrick will hold four events regarding each of the policy pillars-- in Iowa, South Carolina, Chicago, and New York.

For Everyone Everywhere
This election season has been rich in policy proposals — from health care to immigration to taxes. Fellow Democrats up and down the ballot are offering many important and bold solutions to our Nation's biggest and most persistent challenges. At the same time, most people don't live their lives in policy silos, but instead at the intersection of multiple policy and personal choices; not in policy abstractions but at the point where policy touches people. Besides, most voters tell me that they don't vote on the strength of a white paper.
So, in the coming weeks, on DevalPatrick2020.com and at events around the country, we will roll out policy ""agendas,"" packages of interconnecting policy proposals that help to show what it takes to make change that lasts at the level where policy touches people. Much of it comes from experience I have had getting results. Some of it is informed by experience in other contexts where the lessons are transferable. All of it is anchored in what people tell me are on their hearts and minds.
Our policy agendas will offer a lot of the ""what,"" a bit of the ""when,"" and even some of the ""how."" And because no candidate and no party has a corner on all the best ideas, there will also be ways on the website to engage citizens on alternative ways to accomplish the goals.
But instead of going straight to the ""what,"" the ""when"" and the ""how,"" I'd like to start with why. Because I think it is important for Americans to understand why, as a leader and as a citizen, I am so deeply committed to building together a more prosperous and just America for everyone everywhere.
Optimism and Effort — Deval's Story
I have lived the American Dream. As many know, I grew up in poverty on the South Side of Chicago, in my grandparents' crowded two-bedroom tenement. I went to big, broken, overcrowded, under-resourced, sometimes violent public schools, schools with beleaguered yet often inspiring teachers. All around me were broken playgrounds, broken street lights, broken families and broken lives — much of it the result of broken promises.
Even so, I was never raised to lower my gaze or my ambitions. I wanted to go to college, and was encouraged to go — even though no one in our home had ever been. I was encouraged to build a career and a family I could provide for, to imagine being a citizen of the world, and expected to contribute to it. I wasn't raised to feel entitled to anything — except that if I worked hard and played by the rules, I could get a fair chance.
My early lessons were never about blind optimism. ""Hope for the best,"" my grandmother would tell us, ""and work for it."" Optimism and effort — and an unspoken trust that America would provide a fair chance. And while this may once have been the expectation of average Americans everywhere, it was rarely so for African Americans, especially those who grew up under Jim Crow. So the lessons I got from those particular adults are gifts I cherish deeply.
I got a break through a scholarship to a boarding school outside of Boston, and then another one to college and eventually law school at Harvard. I have since been a civil rights lawyer and a business lawyer, a business executive and a two-term governor, and the founder of an impact investment fund. I have had a chance to raise a family, to own a home, to make a way for myself, and to help others. I have lived the American Dream.
Grit, resilience, personal responsibility were all necessary for my American Dream. But so was a good school and great teachers. So was a job when I was ready for it and a way to travel to and from it. So was a college and a place to live and a doctor that I could afford. So was public assistance and public safety when my family and I needed them.
Nothing was easy or predictable, and not everything went right. But the point is that I have not been limited by the circumstances of my birth — because of my own efforts, because of the grace of God and many others, and also because government provided those things that helped me help myself. Government — not as some distant, nameless, faceless abstraction but as us, you and me, as ""the name we give to the things we choose to do together"" (in the words of former Congressman Barney Frank). In a sense, government was the guarantor of basic fairness.
That matters because freedom in America depends on equality, opportunity and fair play, hard won foundational truths. In America, as Bryan Stephenson so beautifully puts it, ""the opposite of poverty is not wealth: it's justice."" Basic fairness. My American Dream was made possible by having a fair chance.
Up for Grabs
In many ways, for many people, America has become less fair. Even when heading off to boarding school, I knew that I was not the only one. I knew there were other kids just as bright, just as ambitious as me who were not getting and would not get their chance. I knew that the deck had been stacked against African Americans from the start and that even then, in the 1960s and 70s, the Nation was still grappling with how to square our reality with our ideals.
Over the years, we've seen the American Dream grow further and further out of reach for more and more Americans in more and more places. We've seen the steady retreat from public schools, the persistent unwillingness to rebuild broken things and neighborhoods and people. We've seen attention paid to certain fortunate corners of the country while smaller cities and towns and rural communities — and even poor neighborhoods in those otherwise flourishing big cities — see mostly neglect. From leaders in every sector, we've seen a careless overemphasis on short-term gain — businesses focused mainly on the next quarter, elected officials focused mainly on the next election — while our long-term interests suffer.
We've tilted our economy and our politics toward the well-connected. We've come to associate poverty with the unrelated concept of fault. And we've bleached justice slowly but methodically out of the criminal justice system. Common cause, let alone common decency, has vanished from much of our national politics, and we've so diminished and belittled government over the years that the public's confidence in it to address common needs keeps sinking.
Leaders who spend every waking moment trying to divide us have made it worse. Caging children and demeaning the weak and vulnerable has made us ashamed.
But the troubling fact is that before the current administration the poor were stuck in poverty, and the Great Recession exposed how the middle class are just a paycheck or two away from being poor. People know the cheery economic indicators don't tell the whole story: how inflation is low so long as you don't count the cost of housing, education and health care, the very things that help people lift themselves and their families to a better life; how unemployment is low so long as you do count both of the minimum wage jobs it takes to survive. The frustration, alienation and even betrayal folk feel in farm country, in coal country, in small cities and towns and many a suburb across America today is remarkably like what I recognize from growing up on the South Side of Chicago. The American Dream I have lived is up for grabs.
Results in Massachusetts
But it doesn't have to be this way. There is a way forward that's not about holding others back, without blaming the unknown or fearing the future. There is a way to build together.
I know because that's what we did in Massachusetts. We faced the worst economic crisis in a generation but, because we stuck together, made shared sacrifices to enable shared prosperity, we emerged stronger on the other side.
After 8 years of hard work and focus, Massachusetts ranked first in the nation in student achievement, health care coverage, energy efficiency, veterans' services, and entrepreneurial activity, to name just a few.
We helped revive an economy hammered by recession by turning it into a global innovation powerhouse, creating a 25-year employment high.
We developed a national model for addressing climate change by working with our neighboring states on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a successful cap and trade program; planning for and investing in resilience and recovery; closing coal-fired power plants; and building a solar, wind and energy efficiency sector that generated ample alternatives and created tens of thousands of jobs.
We made meaningful reforms in transportation, criminal justice, the ethics rules and the pension system — and we did it with unions instead of to them.
And we did that and more with responsible budgets, while earning the highest bond rating in state history.
We didn't get everything right; nobody does. But we got these and other results because we governed not just for today but for tomorrow, not just for the people who voted for us, but for everyone everywhere.
If we want affordable health care for everyone everywhere, if we want an economy that offers a future for everyone everywhere, if we want a justice system that is just, an immigration system that works, and a tax system that makes sense, we need leadership that builds bridges. A politics that says we have to agree on everything before we can work together on anything, that offers government by slogan and short-term wins, that consistently puts power ahead of principle, is exactly the kind of politics that brought us to this point. Substituting our version of that kind of politics for theirs in this next election is not actually going to deliver change that lasts, if it delivers change at all.
I am running for President to deliver meaningful change that lasts — not for the sake of change itself, or in the service of some slogan or passing catchphrase. But to help America keep her foundational commitments, to renew the American Dream, and to put it within reach of everyone everywhere.
That's why I am proposing the policies to come. They are the means to a very ambitious but achievable end. They are the tools, the innovations and the investments I believe we can and must achieve to renew the American Dream.
The Deval for All Policy Platform
There are four parts:

An Opportunity Agenda to grow our economy, create better jobs, create wealth for more people in more places, and create national wealth to reduce the national debt;
A Reform Agenda to fix those big systems — including health care, immigration, criminal justice, and taxes — so that they align with our values and enable, instead of impair, the American Dream;
A Democracy Agenda to enable our democracy to serve all people, not just the powerful and the well-connected, so that Washington produces the results citizens want; and
A Leadership Agenda to rebuild our power and influence in the world, for friends and foes alike, based on the strength of our diplomatic and intelligence capabilities, our military, our economy, and our values.

This post offers an overview of the full platform. In January, we will announce more details about each agenda here on Medium, at DevalPatrick2020.com, and at events around the country.
The Opportunity Agenda
Opportunity is central to the American Dream. We need an economy that builds on America's strengths in innovation, that seizes the competitive edge in a global knowledge economy, that engages the ingenuity and creativity of all Americans, and that makes a place for everyone everywhere when they are ready to work. To me, that means more than redistribution. That means an economy that grows out to the middle and the marginalized, not just up to the well-connected. I reject ""trickle down economics,"" that long-discredited but stubbornly-held notion that if we just favor the rich, benefits will ""trickle down"" to everybody else. Instead I believe we must place our emphasis on the things people need to lift themselves on a path to economic mobility and their American Dream: education, innovation and infrastructure.
Education. First, I believe Americans everywhere should have ready access to first-rate education — free from pre-K to community college or the first two years of a 4-year college, free or reduced thereafter (depending on a person's having participated in national service, about which we will say more in our Democracy Agenda), and affordable through life-long workforce development and retraining. In a knowledge-based economy, such as ours is becoming, education is the single best investment we can make in our own collective future.
As your President, my administration will make those investments. It starts with supporting teachers and the public schools in which they teach. Having a well-prepared and committed teacher in front of a classroom can transform the life of a child and retrace the arc of a life. We need to treat teaching as the profession it is.
We will work with states and cities to dramatically expand federal support for public schools, and pair that investment with new tools — like longer school days, after-school enrichment programs, or more social services in the schools themselves — to make sure every child has the opportunity to thrive, and to close persistent achievement gaps. We should support STEM education, foreign language teaching, opportunities for skills development such as coding, vocational and technical skills to help address the middle skills gap, and so-called ""soft skills"" training. The goal is to have excellent schools with excellent teachers within reach of every child, everywhere. The strategy should be flexible enough to meet the different needs of different children in different communities.
So that they are free or at least affordable, public colleges and universities should be publicly funded. The retreat from this basic formula is the reason public higher education has become in many places as inaccessible as private institutions for many students. For students overburdened by student debt today, we should at a minimum refinance their debt to eliminate or substantially reduce the interest; if we did so retroactively, we could credit excess interest paid against the principal balance. Our objective must be to eliminate student debt entirely and responsibly. And any student who gives a year or more of national military or civilian service — a paid program we will propose as part of the Democracy Agenda — would be given as many years of free tuition and fees at a public college or university.
Education is the on-ramp to opportunity in the knowledge economy and making it accessible must be a top priority of my administration, working collaboratively with states, cities, towns and rural leadership, teachers and other innovators dedicated to building a better future. We made great progress in Massachusetts, and I believe many of those approaches can scale up to the national level.
Innovation. After education, we should focus on innovation because it is our competitive edge in the world. That means cultivating industries like clean tech, precision manufacturing, robotics, gaming, cybersecurity, transportation, green construction and biotech, urban agriculture, and regenerative and organic farming, biofuels, and soil carbon sequestration to name just a few of the economic revolutions underway or within our grasp. It also means making capital available, not just loans, outside the concentrations of capital on the East and West Coasts, along with mentorship and coaching, so that entrepreneurs start their businesses and small businesses can grow. Supporting entrepreneurs in local communities can create more jobs and wealth. I believe that the public/private partnership of MassChallenge is a model for the this kind of business incubator that can be replicated in communities across the country where, as we know, talent already exists but capital and a cluster of fellow innovators may not.
Not only does this approach offer an opportunity for individuals and families to build their own future in areas where housing may be more affordable and their family may already have roots, but it is a key ingredient in the formula for rebuilding the hollowed-out centers in many small cities and towns across the country whose residents feel left behind by or worried about rapid economic change.
America should dominate the innovation economy. Not only does it play to our historical strengths, but it can also help answer some of our most pressing social and environmental challenges. Take income inequality. Beyond the redistribution others are talking about, expanding the economic pie and enabling more people to earn and to own a greater share of it is critical. And we need to be ""all in"" on a growth strategy that reaches every part of the country — not just in major cities on the coasts, and not just for folks with advanced degrees. Improving economic mobility — the fair chance for people now and in future generations to live their American Dream — is the lasting answer to economic inequality.
Climate. A flourishing innovation economy similarly helps us address climate change. Developing solar, wind and other generation alternatives, as well as ever better strategies for energy efficiency, is essential to moving quickly to a carbon-free future. It also creates a market opportunity for new companies, new jobs and new exports. Rather than seeing the future as a threat, we can shape our own future, and we can do it in a way that expands opportunity for working people and people who live in communities where they feel American enterprise has forgotten them. That is what we tried to do in Massachusetts, and it's a formula that can work for America.
Infrastructure. Infrastructure investment is the third key ingredient. It is perhaps the unglamorous work of government but it is the public platform for personal ambition and private prosperity. It also creates jobs now. We are not talking about make-work. America needs first-class roads, rails, bridges, train stations, and airports to move people and goods efficiently and safely around the country and around the world. America needs access to high-speed broadband and mobile service everywhere to move ideas, orders, health care (including acute and mental health care), education and training, and to meet public safety and national security needs. America needs a modern, efficient and reliable electric grid and modern, reliable and safe drinking water systems in every community. We need school buildings and parks, laboratories and libraries, rural health centers and urban hospitals. And we need resilience and recovery plans developed and invested in to respond to a changing climate, with a keen eye on the poor and minority communities where much of the impact will land.
Americans know we need extensive and sustained investment in public infrastructure. Americans also understand that investing in infrastructure now pays off in multiples over time, just as we today benefit from investments made in the 1950s and 1960s. There are innovations in how we make those investments (new construction technologies, new ways to think of energy efficiency, new partnerships between federal, state and local governments, public-private partnerships) that we should try, but making those investments will be a critical priority in my administration's work to renew the American Dream.
The Reform Agenda
The Reform Agenda that is about making meaningful fixes to the big systems that consistently fail to meet modern needs.
Health Care. We are committed to health care for every American everywhere that provides reliable, affordable, high-quality health services. We do it by supporting and expanding a public option within the Affordable Care Act, one that is free to some and low cost to others, and that could even be modeled on Medicare. And we will engage a broad coalition of stakeholders, from health providers and policymakers to patient advocates to refine and propose improvements as we learn — the very formula that made it possible in Massachusetts to deliver health insurance to nearly 99% of our residents.
Immigration. America deserves an immigration system that assures human dignity as well as a secure border, that encourages the determined and creative whose values align with ours to make their home here. We will propose to do it by providing a path to citizenship for Dreamers and others in the country without legal status; work authorization to students who complete their studies in the United States; smoother, more transparent, more secure and predictable visa application processes and enforcement; and a recommitment to our historic openness to refugees and new Americans. We must also secure our borders and other ports of entry, but with more modern, more effective and less ham-fisted ways than with a physical wall. And while we are at it, ICE needs an overhaul.
Criminal Justice. America needs a justice system that focuses less on warehousing people than on preparing them to re-enter productive life. An end to private prisons, an end to the criminal prohibition on marijuana, a revival of parole and other programs to prepare the incarcerated for their release, treating those dealing with substance use disorders as patients instead of criminals, and sentencing reform that provides non-violent drug offenders a real chance at re-entering society are all elements of this agenda.
Gun Safety. America needs better gun safety measures. We must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. That requires, at a minimum, universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and retrofits like bump stocks, coupled with a voluntary buyback initiative. And it requires support for research on the cause and sources of gun violence.
Taxation. And we need reform of our tax systems. On the personal income tax side, we should treat all income as ordinary income (including carried interest and other investment income), dramatically simplify the code, so that everyone — from the meek to the mighty — pays their fair share of the price of our civilization. We should raise the corporate income tax to 25% and eliminate the loopholes that still permit some of the most profitable companies in the world to pay no income taxes. And finally, we should raise the estate tax, paid once when wealth is transferred at death, with every dime collected used to pay down the national debt and invest in America's future.
The Democracy Agenda
There is much more to reform. Assuring veterans' access to adequate health services. Protecting reproductive rights. Prosecuting hate crimes and domestic terrorism. Respecting while also serving Native communities. Regulating ""big tech"" companies. The agenda is long because the list of challenges that has been ignored or overlooked is long. But that is a direct consequence of how we govern ourselves today.
For too long, we have treated our democracy like it could take infinite abuse without damage. That is simply not true. It's time for that to change. And that's why we need to pursue a Democracy Agenda.
Voting. We would start with voting. The Justice Department in a Patrick administration will aggressively combat the vote suppression that has steadily and cynically choked off the fundamental act of citizenship. We would also explore ways to make voting easier: automatic voter registration, election day registration, early voting and voting by mail. We need to update the Voting Rights Act, and engage a joint state-federal effort to incentivize states to expand access to the ballot.
Campaign Finance. We will work with the Congress to fundamentally reshape the way we finance our political campaigns, including pushing ""dark"" money out and limiting the influence of lobbyists. Citizens United must be overturned.
Democratic Institutions. The Electoral College has outlived its usefulness and we will work to abolish it in the Constitution. We would also work with Congress and state legislators to end hyper-partisan gerrymandering, where elected officials choose their voters instead of the other way around.
National Service. To rebuild our national community, indeed our democracy, we will propose universal national service for all 17 or 18 year olds. What concerns me as much as our national divisions is how easy it is to divide us. I believe this is because Americans don't know each other. Working alongside another American from another part of the country in service of the country's military or civilian needs gives us the chance to understand each other more deeply, and ultimately to reject the superficial assumptions we make about other Americans whose backgrounds and experiences are different — while also helping the Nation address a host of unmet needs. From AmeriCorps to the Peace Corps to teaching opportunities at home and aboard to service with the armed forces — we will advance ways to give Americans, young and old, the paid opportunity to serve their country and their community. And in return for their national service, service members will earn free tuition at public universities.
The Leadership Agenda
Finally, our Leadership Agenda addresses my plan to rebuild American power and influence in the world, among friends and foes alike, on the strength of our military, our economy, our diplomatic and intelligence resources, and our values. Instead of bullying or demeaning other countries and peoples, instead of erratic and unpredictable international partnerships, instead of limitless war with only limited impact and objective, I believe American leadership should be steady, reliable, firm and consequential.
As a young man working for the UN in Sudan, or a lawyer helping to write the South African Constitution, or an impact investor, or the governor of Massachusetts, I have solved problems, done business, and built relationships all over the world — in some 31 countries. Along the way, I have picked up a few lessons about how to accomplish things overseas.
Strong Alliances with Democracies. The first is that relationships matter. Whether trying to reach a business deal or sign a treaty, you make friends first. As President, I will renew our bonds with our close allies and the world's democracies. Strengthening ties with global allies and trading partners makes us safer and more prosperous. And with those partners, we will tackle global challenges like climate change by re-entering the Paris Accords, confronting aggressors like Russia, Iran and North Korea, and rebalancing power on the global stage with China.
A Modern, Professional Foreign Policy. Another lesson: preparation is key. I will not conduct foreign policy over Twitter, impulsively and without advice or a plan. We will rebuild the professional ranks and resources of Foreign Service and intelligence services. We will enhance our cyber security capabilities. And we will examine whether the training and materiel of the modern military are ready to meet modern challenges.
Strength from our Values. Perhaps the most important lesson I learned abroad was as a young man working in Sudan, where someone asked me to explain the American Civil Rights Movement. And it struck me how our ability to tell the story of America abroad convincingly depends on whether we live that story at home. Our standing in the world, and our ability to get things done overseas, rises and falls with our ability to show the world that ""we are who we say we are."" Our values of equality, opportunity and fair play are the ultimate source of our strength and our fealty to them the source of our credibility. As President, I will never lose sight of that, and I will assure that our citizens do not either.
The Character of the Country
Opportunity, Reform, and Democracy Agendas to renew the American Dream at home, and a Leadership Agenda to renew our power and influence abroad — that is the framework for the policies my administration will pursue.
Changes that meet the scale of our national and global challenges, changes that last, will require more than indignation, however righteous it may be. Changes that last require leadership that can build bridges. Because more than the character of the candidates is at stake this time. This time it's about the character of the country. This time it's about renewing the American Dream so it works for everyone everywhere. This time it's about whether we are prepared to do the work of rebuilding our national community, for today and for tomorrow.
I have spent the past few weeks meeting Democrats across the country — mostly, but not exclusively, in the early primary or caucus states. I have been greeted overwhelmingly by encouragement and excitement. The policies I talk about and the leadership I offer clearly speak to American aspirations — not just Democrats but Independents and more than a few Republicans. I am asking voters I meet to take a chance, not on me, but on their own aspirations for themselves as citizens and for the future of the country.
That's the kind of leadership I'm about, it's what our policy platform is based on, and it's the kind of responsibility I will bear as President of the United States.

Castro Campaign Press Release - Julián Castro to Iowans in New Ad: I'm Going to Tell You the Truth When Others Won't,2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Julián Castro,/documents/castro-campaign-press-release-julian-castro-iowans-new-ad-im-going-tell-you-the-truth-when,"
Castro campaign releases new ad in Iowa during presidential debate telling Iowans why he believes they should no longer hold first-in-the-nation status
SAN ANTONIO, TX (December 19, 2019) – On Thursday, December 19, surrounding the DNC's December presidential debate, the presidential campaign of former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for President Obama and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro will release a new advertisement airing on broadcast stations across Iowa and on social media about telling voters the truth when other candidates won't. The ad's release comes after the most recent national poll showed Secretary Castro at four percent, ahead of Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Cory Booker, Andrew Yang, and trailing Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Mayor Michael Bloomberg by one percent.
The ad, which will air across broadcast stations in Iowa and on social media on the day of the debate, features footage from Secretary Castro's recent town hall on the Iowa caucuses, where he told Iowans why he believes Iowa and New Hampshire should no longer go first in the nominating process. Secretary Castro is the only candidate to publicly express support for changing the nominating schedule—citing the lack of diversity and low participation rate in the first two states.
During the debate on Thursday, Secretary Castro and supporters will highlight on social media issues that are left unaddressed by the candidates on stage, as well as Secretary Castro's leadership and positions on the issues that are debated.
Secretary Castro secured the grassroots donations required to make the debate, but did not secure the necessary polling. For the November debate, although Secretary Castro did not secure the necessary polling to secure his spot on stage, ""Julian Castro"" trended #14 in the nation and the campaign had a better fundraising day than the previous two debates.

"Remarks on Health Care Policy in Memphis, Tennessee",2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/remarks-health-care-policy-memphis-tennessee,"
The answer to the question is 20-years-old. If you do that kind of speech again, I'm going to be out of business.
Elijah, thank you for sharing your story with us – and for being here today. And I can just promise you we're going to do everything we can so that nobody else will have to go through this situation. And if we get it done, you will have been part of the solution, so thank you for all of that.
Good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here in Memphis.
Earlier this week I was in Charlotte, North Carolina. And before that I had spent a little time in Texas. But there is no truth to the rumor that I am organizing my campaign stops around the places with the best barbeque.
I know some of you are still celebrating Memphis's big basketball win over Tennessee the other day. If there are any Tennessee fans here, just look on the bright side: at least you're not New York Knicks fans.
Actually, by the way, the head coach of the Memphis men's basketball team, Penny Hardaway, actually played on the Knicks for a couple of years while I was mayor.
That was a long time ago. I go to occasional Knicks game, I just don't remember if he was there, but it was only my second term back then, and Donald Trump was only on his fifth bankruptcy.
Back in 2016, I warned that if Donald Trump ran our country like he ran his companies, we'd be in a whole lot of trouble – and I'm sorry to say that's exactly what has happened.
Extorting a foreign head of state for campaign purposes is a gross abuse of power – and the House, I think, did its Constitutional duty by impeaching him yesterday. It's unfortunate, it's terrible.
Unfortunately, it increasingly appears that Senate Republicans will not do their duty. The issue won't be settled until November, by we the American people.
That's why 2020 is not just an election. It is a referendum on how to save our Constitution – or let Trump light a fire on it, and that's just not going to happen. That's why it's so important, I think, that we nominate the candidate who gives us the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, and bring our country back together.
Now, I don't know if you often see many presidential candidates in Tennessee. That's unfortunate, because places like Memphis have different challenges and perspectives than other cities where all the other candidates are focusing their time right now. I believe our party has to put places like Memphis front and center – and that's what I'm trying to do in my campaign.
One of the biggest challenges here in Memphis and across the state – and that's why I'm here – is health care. And if I'm elected president, health care will be right at the top of my agenda – which is my subject of the day.
America pays much more for health care than any other country, and those costs are leaving millions of Americans without enough money to make ends meet.
Last year, more than eight million Americans were pushed into poverty by medical bills. Families sold homes to treat sick children. Others went broke paying for life-saving operations, or started Go Fund Me campaigns to raise money for a loved one's cancer treatment. It just breaks your heart. This is America, we're wealthy enough to provide people with health care. Why on earth don't we do it?
Millions more Americans skipped doctor visits or didn't fill prescriptions because they couldn't afford it. That should not happen in the world's wealthiest country.
It really is a mark of shame on our country, and rather than fix it, I think that President Trump has made it worse.
When Donald Trump was elected, there were 28 million uninsured people in America. During his first two years in office, the number of uninsured people in America increased by two million.
Tennessee has one of the highest rates of uninsured people in America. Why? And last year, the number of uninsured people here increased by another 50,000. Only two states in America had bigger increases.
Today, thanks to President Trump, more Americans are at risk of catastrophic medical bills. More Americans have to choose between going to the doctor or putting food on the table. More Americans have junk insurance plans that don't cover maternal health or pre-existing conditions.
President Trump has spent three years sabotaging the Affordable Care Act – and offering Americans nothing in return but empty promises. He promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better – but he has never had another plan.
He was determined to throw Americans off the boat, without giving them a lifeline. He just doesn't care if you have a pre-existing condition – he wants to deny you access to coverage. If he is re-elected, he'll keep trying to do that – and I think we can't let that happen.
A famous resident of Memphis of my generation reportedly once said: 'Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain't goin' away.' Elvis, just in case you don't remember.
The truth about Donald Trump is this: he doesn't have the first clue of how to unite and create. He only knows how to divide and destroy. We can't accept that. Lives are at stake.
That's why I'm running for president, to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. And that includes fixing our health care system once and for all.
Now, I know how urgent and important this issue is. Improving public health has been one of the fights of my life.
When I was mayor, our Administration led a major expansion of public health insurance – and we created new policies that increased life expectancy in New York by three years. When I left New York, life expectancy was three years greater than the rest of the country, and three years greater than when I started there.
My company offers the very best health insurance, and the most generous and comprehensive benefits. I think that's good for our company, I think that's good for our employees, I think it's good for our customers. Every American deserves coverage and quality, affordable care – and we can get it done.
To do it won't be easy. We won't take away private insurance – as some candidates would. My proposal will instead build on what works: President Obama's Affordable Care Act.
We'll make sure that people who like their private insurance can keep private insurance, and also provide coverage to the uninsured. We don't need Medicare for All proposals that are more likely to re-elect Donald Trump than to expand coverage.
So let me tell you what I'll do – I want to emphasize the word 'do.' Because to me, leadership isn't about making big promises, shouting into the wind, or shaking your fist at the world.
Leadership sure isn't dreaming up a plan that can never pass Congress. It's about people coming together and getting things done. And let me tell you what I'm going to do on health care as president.
First, every American will be guaranteed access to affordable health insurance. That means millions of Americans who don't have health insurance can get it – and we'll finally achieve universal coverage in this country.
Second, every American who already has private insurance will be able to keep private coverage if they choose, and they will see out-of-pocket costs go down. That's 175 million Americans who will be paying less for health care. And I'll tell you why afterwards.
Third, we're going to expand the kind of care people can get – including by bringing dental coverage to millions of Americans who right now cannot afford it.
Now, here's how we'll do all this – let's start with universal coverage. Back in 2010, President Obama proposed giving Americans the opportunity to buy public health insurance. It's called a public option – and it's effectively a chance to buy into a Medicare-like policy provided by the federal government that is less expensive than existing options. I supported the idea back then. President Obama was right to push for it. And in 2021, working with Congress, I think we can sell Congress on passing it – we're going to get this done.
To achieve universal coverage, we'll work aggressively to enroll uninsured Americans. I know we can do that – because we did exactly the same thing in New York.
During my 12 years as mayor, we cut the number of uninsured New Yorkers by 50 percent. We can do it nationally by expanding outreach and simplifying enrollment.
We'll also have a plan to deal with states that refuse to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
It's simple, actually. We'll enroll into the public option automatically anyone who is eligible for expanded Medicaid coverage, and we will do the same for every American who is eligible for Medicaid, but is not currently receiving it. That will cover another 2.5 million people across America – including another 244,000 people in Tennessee.
The public option will make health care more affordable – including for Americans who already have private coverage, because it will drive down prices. But if we stopped there, health care costs would continue to push people into poverty – and too many people would decide to forgo coverage. You have to make a decision, do I pay for my insurance or I do something else? That's not the kind of options people should have to make.
So here we go further – and today I'm proposing five steps to substantially reduce health care costs for all Americans, and I'll just mention each one briefly.
One, we'll have to cap hospital bills at no more than twice what Medicare pays for some service. Some states in America already do this, so when you say it can't be done, it certainly can be done.
Right now, hospitals and other health care providers often charge patients with private insurance four or five times as much as they charge patients with Medicare – simply because they can.
The insurers then pass those costs on to their customers, in the form of higher monthly premiums, higher deductibles, and higher co-pays. By setting a ceiling that's tied to Medicare, we can bring down those costs for all Americans.
Two, we will ban all surprise medical bills – which can happen when out-of-network doctors are hired by in-network hospitals but the patient isn't told in advance. If you're in the middle of a medical emergency, you shouldn't have to worry about whether the doctor treating you is part of your insurance plan. But when you get home and you get a bill, you sure start worrying about it.
Three, the federal government will cap your monthly premiums if you choose the public option, or if you buy private insurance in the marketplace and your premium amounts to more than 8.5 percent of your income, you'll get a government tax credit to reduce the private cost down to below that level.
Four, we'll charge a small fee to the private insurers to create a fund that will cover 50 percent of very high claims, say those over $100,000 for those tragic extra expensive cases that you read about. The fund will help further drive down premium costs, we think, by an average of 10 percent. Another step in the right direction of more health care, better health care, and not for very much more money, if at all.
And five, we are going to lower drug costs by doing what should've been done decades ago: allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies and cap prices for everyone, just like every other nation does.
It is just outrageous that Americans pay many times as much as people in other nations – for the same drug. And usually, those drugs are developed right here in America – often with taxpayer supported funds through National Institute of Health. So we're paying for the development, and then we're paying more for those drugs. If anything, we should be paying less than the other countries, after all we're paying for the research.
We'll also eliminate drug company payments to pharmacy middlemen, which stifle competition and drives up prices for life-saving drugs, like insulin. And we will cap out-of-pocket drug expenses for people in Medicare.
Now, as a candidate and as a president, Donald Trump said he was going to take the pharmaceutical industry on and lower drug prices. After three years and zero progress, this week he said he would allow states to import some drugs from Canada, where they are cheaper.
That wouldn't work to lower drug prices, what are drug companies going to do? They'll get around it easily by just limiting supplies in Canada. But as we know, this president has a long history of not doing what he says he's going to do.
There is an army of lobbyists in Washington working all day long to keep the broken, expensive system we have in place – and they make a lot of campaign contributions unfortunately.
By the way, if you look at my campaign's filing, you will see I don't take a penny from any company that has any connection with any health care whatsoever. You know how certain I am of this? Because I don't take a penny from anybody.
Somebody said to me the other day, 'You're spending a lot of money.' I said yes, I'm making an investment in replacing Donald Trump, and it's the best investment I could make.
In my administration, the lobbyists won't get past the lobby. But with the Trump Administration, the lobbyists are winning – and not just on health care.
President Trump, for reasons I just don't understand, has rolled over for special interests again and again. He's done it for the pharmaceutical lobby, the gun lobby, the coal lobby, the e-cigarette lobby – stop me when you get bored – and he wants people to think that he's strong and tough. Give me a break.
When special interests come calling, he purrs like a pussycat. We need a president who has more courage than the Cowardly Lion. And I can just tell you, I've spent my career taking on the toughest battles and the biggest opponents – including Donald Trump.
I've beaten him before. People say how are you going to beat Donald Trump? I've beaten him before, and I'm ready to beat him again this November.
One of the first things I'll do as president is to reverse President Trump's support for a lawsuit that would invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act.
Just think about how irresponsible that is: the President has never proposed any plan for covering the 20 million people who would lose coverage.
I don't know any business person who would manage an organization that way – and if they tried, they would be fired. That's what we need to do incidentally next November – change the presidency.
The President has already done enough damage to health care in this country – including by introducing junk insurance plans that can bar Americans with pre-existing conditions from getting coverage.
That means an American with high blood-pressure, diabetes, or a disability, can actually be denied health care coverage. In other words, the people who need health care the most are the ones most likely to be rejected. That makes no sense whatsoever. And as president, I'll restore rules barring insurers from excluding people because of pre-existing conditions.
The Affordable Care Act was actually a major achievement that took us in the right direction, and President Obama deserves an awful lot of credit for that. But now we have to finish the job, and we have to make sure that every person in America has access to coverage and affordable care.
And I believe we need to go even further, in a number of important ways. For instance, each year, a third of Americans don't go to the dentist because of the costs. So we should expand Medicare to cover dental care – as well as vision and hearing care – and require that states cover dental care for people on Medicaid.
We'll also take important steps to strengthen healthcare in rural communities – where it has been decimated by many states' refusal to expand Medicaid.
A third of the people in Tennessee get care at rural hospitals. But ten rural hospitals have closed in Tennessee since 2012, and another 15 could be at risk. That means people have to travel further for care – including emergency care – or not get it at all. And that's true in states across this country.
As president, I will stop the bleeding – and bring back care to rural communities. We will increase and stabilize federal funding for rural hospitals and double funding for community health centers so that they can provide mental health, dental health, and substance abuse services, which God knows we need.
We will also give community hospitals incentives to take other steps that improve patient health, including help them get to and from doctors' appointments. That's a problem for people in rural and urban communities – and our plan will help Elijah's family and many others like them get the quality care that they need.
I will also launch a comprehensive national effort that focuses on preventing disease, and stops the decline in life expectancy that has happened in recent years. For the first time in history, life expectancy has gone down three years in a row. It's just an amazing statistic – up every place else around the world, down three years in a row since World War I, in all fairness. Because the most important thing we can do to improve health and reduce health costs is preventing people from getting sick or injured in the first place.
In the coming days and weeks, I'll outline plans to address the problems that are cutting lives short in our country, including the opioid epidemic.
We have an overdose and addiction crisis in America – and the president isn't doing anywhere near enough to get things done.
I've been working on this issue through my foundation, and I'll outline an aggressive plan for preventing and treating addiction – and saving more families from the heartbreak of losing children to drug abuse. It is just unbelievable what is happening with the drugs in our country, even in high schools.
Now, any candidate can talk about a plan. But what I think I offer is leadership – and a record of changing big plans into reality.
That's what we did in New York. That's the job of being president. And that's the message I think we need to beat Trump.
Voters are tired of politics-as-usual. That's why many voters turned to Trump in 2016. But as many people have come to see, Trump is all talk and no action.
Or as they say in Texas, all hat and no cattle. Although it might be more accurate to say, all hair and no cattle.
I'm a doer – and we have a lot of work to do. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get working. I was lucky enough to be mayor of New York City, eight million people and 300,000 employees. The most progressive city in the country, and we made an enormous difference. And I hope you'll join me because I think we can do the same thing all across this nation.
So thank you for coming out – and I look forward to spending more time in the great state of Tennessee.
Thank you all.

"Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg Releases New Health Care Plan, Outlines Real Reforms for Better, Affordable Health Care",2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-releases-new-health-care-plan-outlines,"
Despite U.S. Health Care Spending at $3.65 Trillion Last Year, the Country's Life Expectancy Continues to Decline on Trump's Watch
Memphis, Tennessee — Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg unveiled his new health care policy today detailing achievable reforms that will deliver better, affordable health care for all Americans. Bloomberg released his health care plan during a speech in Tennessee, where the number of uninsured is on the rise – nearly one in ten Tennesseans do not have health coverage. Over the last few years, over 100,000 children were dropped from TennCare coverage without proper notification. Bloomberg's plan will create a Medicare-like public option which lowers health care and drug costs, and increases access to care in rural areas.
There are 28 million people without health care coverage in the United States, most of whom cannot afford their existing options. Bloomberg's policy will allow people to buy a Medicare-like health insurance policy, administered by the federal government but paid for by customer premiums. This will help increase the number of people who are covered by providing a less expensive option. The increase in competition will also help to drive down private insurance premiums, making insurance more affordable overall.
""No one should have to forgo care because they don't have insurance, and no one should face hardships because of medical bills,"" said Mike Bloomberg. ""President Trump has spent three years sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and offering nothing in return but empty promises. We will reverse the president's attacks on the Affordable Care Act, reach universal coverage, reduce costs for all Americans, increase support for rural communities, and fix our broken healthcare system once and for all.""
As Mayor of New York, Mike Bloomberg expanded health care for working families and improved care for seniors.  The number of New Yorkers without health insurance fell nearly 50 percent between 2001 and 2013, from 1.8 million to 927,000, with a 72 percent drop in the number of uninsured children, from 288,000 to 82,000, during the same period.
The new policy will make insurance less expensive for everyone, including those who do not receive it through their employer. There are four strategies in the plan to make insurance less expensive for those people.

First, extending tax credits for individuals and families whose health insurance premiums amount to more than 8.5 percent of their income in the health care marketplace. This would allow roughly 2.4 million more people to afford coverage in the marketplace.
Second, fixing the family glitch by allowing families with expensive employer-sponsored insurance to buy health plans in the individual market with federal subsidies, giving roughly six million more people help with their premiums.
Third, creating a permanent federal reinsurance program for the individual market which would reduce premiums by up to 10 percent.
Lastly, conducting aggressive efforts to sign people up for insurance. This would include enrollment opportunities in doctor's offices, hospitals, and food stamp centers. There are roughly 7.5 million people eligible for free or low-cost coverage who could be enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP, and another 4.7 million eligible for a fully subsidized bronze plan in the individual market. As mayor, Mike Bloomberg conducted similar outreach in daycare centers, schools, and medical centers to inform the uninsured about their health-care options.

In his speech at Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library, Bloomberg criticized President Trump for his efforts to undermine the health care system and deny vital coverage to millions of Americans. The Trump administration has shortened the sign-up period for buying health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by half to just 45 days and cut funding for sign-up efforts to just $10 million. As a result, the number of uninsured Americans has been increasing roughly 1 million people a year under President Trump. Mike Bloomberg's plan would reinstate the full 90-day sign-up period and restore funding for outreach efforts. President Trump has also authorized short-term insurance plans which do not include preventive care, maternal care, and other essential benefits to compete alongside high-quality ACA-authorized policies. In addition, Bloomberg's policy will require that all insurance plans meet the standards set under the ACA like covering maternal care and pre-existing conditions.
Bloomberg also made clear that he is ready to defend the ACA in the face of a lawsuit brought by Texas and other states threatening to overturn the nation's health care law. Tennessee faces a uniquely difficult health care situation with its diabetes, cardiovascular, and hypertension rates among the highest in the nation. The state, which has about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees, is one of 14 states that has not expanded the program under the ACA, and critics say the block-grant model puts the most vulnerable at risk if the state faces an economic downturn or increases restrictions on Medicaid enrollment.
To reinforce this message, the Bloomberg campaign also released ""Done It Before"" — a new national digital ad focused on health care which begins airing today in Super Tuesday states like Tennessee. The ad presents a sharp contrast between Mike Bloomberg as a ""doer"" versus President Trump as ""destroyer.""
Additional key components of Mike's plan include:

Eliminating ""surprise medical bills"" by requiring in-network hospitals to provide in-network care. Doctors and clinicians who operate within a network hospital will be required to accept in-network rates.
Capping out-of-network hospital prices at 200 percent of Medicare rates, in order to drive health care prices down overall.
Lowering drug costs by authorizing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, by eliminating the drug-company payments to pharmacy benefit managers, and by reforming the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit to encourage greater competition, and cap beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket costs at $2,000.

Medicare does not currently cover routine dental, vision, or hearing checkups. The proposed policy will add an additional supplemental Medicare benefit, similar to the drug benefit, to cover dental, vision, and hearing care. Beneficiaries would pay a separate premium, which would be $25 per month. To help low-income adults get dental care, Mike Bloomberg would expand Medicaid to cover dental care in all states to help provide preventive care for those who are least able to afford it.
Additionally, Bloomberg's policy addresses significant gaps in care in rural communities by expanding access to good health care with increased funding for rural hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments and increasing access to telehealth services. This would entail switching from a fee-for-service payment structure to paying rural hospitals a capitated amount to manage the care for the patients in their area. The proposal includes increasing federal grants to Community Health Centers, which provide free or low-cost care. Under Bloomberg's health care plan, Medicare would be required to cover more telehealth services, and get rid of facility fees when patients are given telehealth care at home.
""This plan identifies ways to lower costs and increase coverage, which is a high priority for consumers,"" said Kathleen Sebelius, former Governor and Former Health and Human Services Secretary. ""Mike also proposes continuing to provide consumer choice and market competition with regulatory controls, as well as restoring the fundamental framework of the Affordable Care Act which has been under attack in this administration.""
""When Mike was Mayor, he championed healthcare policies that greatly expanded healthcare for working families,"" said Al Aviles, former president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. ""The number of New Yorkers without health insurance fell nearly 50 percent during his administration. At the same time, he strongly supported improving care within our City's vast public healthcare system for seniors with chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure. I know Mike as a pragmatic, results-oriented leader with a deep commitment to ensuring affordable, high quality healthcare for everyone. And that's the type of leader we need.""
""American cities need a partner in Washington when it comes to health care,"" said Columbia South Carolina Mayor and Campaign Co-Chair Steve Benjamin. ""We can get the ball rolling, we can listen to our constituents. But, at the end of the day, improving our health care system requires national leadership. Mike will bring that.""
""Mike led the expansion of access to quality affordable health care for New Yorkers as mayor,"" said Dr. Michael Stocker, former chairman of the board of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and former CEO of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. ""Based on Mike's record, I am confident he can drive change at the national level to improve the health of all Americans.""
Today's announcement builds on Mike Bloomberg's record as a leading public health advocate spanning from his time as New York City Mayor, during which life expectancy in New York City increased by three years, to his philanthropic work, which includes taking on the tobacco companies in low-and middle income countries, combating the opioid crisis, fighting the youth e-cigarette epidemic, and much more.

"Bennet Campaign Press Release - Paul LeBlanc, President of Southern New Hampshire University, Endorses Michael Bennet for President",2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-press-release-paul-leblanc-president-southern-new-hampshire-university,"
The opinions expressed are neither the opinions of Southern New Hampshire University or its Trustees nor endorsed by Southern New Hampshire University.
MANCHESTER, NH — Paul LeBlanc, president of Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), and his wife, attorney and professor Patricia Findlen, today endorsed Michael Bennet for president of the United States. LeBlanc has led SNHU since 2003, growing the student body to over 135,000 learners and making it the nation's largest nonprofit provider of online higher education.
""I have spoken about education with numerous political leaders and none have possessed Michael's knowledge, thoughtfulness, and nuanced understanding of the issues,"" said LeBlanc. ""At a time of alarming wealth inequity and diminished opportunity for working people, Pat and I feel we need an education president. Someone who understands that education is still the single most powerful tool of social mobility and that it has sadly become part of the problem, not part of the solution, for far too many people.
""We also want someone who has been elected statewide in a purple state, who still thinks about finding the common ground that binds us as Americans. Michael is as comfortable talking to a Colorado rancher or miner as he is talking to an academic or community organizer. He has a natural feel for people and reminds us of their essential goodness. We admire his idealism, even as he brings a roll-up-the-sleeves practicality in getting to work and making things better.
""On the most fundamental level, he's a good man. I want to trust and admire the person leading the country. Yes, that's a question of integrity and morality, and it's also a question of respect for who the person is as a spouse, as a parent, as a neighbor. Trusted friends in Colorado told us years ago that we should pay attention to their senator. We have and what we discovered about Michael has earned our support.""
Bennet recently completed a five-day tour of New Hampshire, including stops in Salem, Bedford, Concord, Andover, Gorham, Lancaster, North Conway, West Ossipee, Dover, and Manchester. He has announced plans to host 50 town halls in the Granite State between now and the first in the nation primary, and returns on Friday for eight more town halls.
""Paul is one of the premier educational innovators in the country, and it's an honor to stand with him and Pat in the fight to restore opportunity for every American child,"" said Bennet. ""Together, I look forward to sharing my plan to bring integrity back to the White House with every primary voter in the Granite State.""
Bennet represents Colorado in the Senate, but he has not spent a lifetime in politics. He turned around failing businesses in the private sector and improved outcomes for kids as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. Bennet is the only candidate in this race who has won two national elections in a swing state. He has released comprehensive, field-leading proposals to provide high-quality, affordable health care with a public option, reward hard work, fix our broken political system, and tackle climate change by working with our farmers and ranchers.

(SAN FRANCISCO, December 19, 2019) –– On Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer participated in an unprecedented virtual Presidential Youth Town Hall hosted by the High School Democrats of America, College Democrats of America, and Young Democrats of America. Steyer's Youth Town Hall was the first of its kind to proactively reach out to the youth community and give them a platform to discuss the topics most pressing to them.
During the town hall, Steyer took questions from young Americans on climate, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, student debt, and affordable housing. He has been fighting for progressive issues and the youth mobilization for a decade.
""In 2018, so last year, NextGen did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history. We went into 38 congressional districts held by Republicans and more than doubled the turnout of people under 30. We can measure that and 33 of the districts flipped,"" Steyer said during the town hall. ""So to me, what that says is, I understand how critical participation of people between 18 and 35 is. I believe that next year's presidential election really will be the one that determines the next generation.""

There are roughly 7.5 million people eligible for free or low-cost coverage who could be enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP, and another 4.7 million eligible for a fully subsidized bronze plan in the individual market. As mayor, Mike Bloomberg conducted similar outreach in daycare centers, schools, and medical centers to inform the uninsured about their health-care options.

In his speech at Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library, Bloomberg criticized President Trump for his efforts to undermine the health care system and deny vital coverage to millions of Americans. The Trump administration has shortened the sign-up period for buying health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by half to just 45 days and cut funding for sign-up efforts to just $10 million. As a result, the number of uninsured Americans has been increasing roughly 1 million people a year under President Trump. Mike Bloomberg's plan would reinstate the full 90-day sign-up period and restore funding for outreach efforts. President Trump has also authorized short-term insurance plans which do not include preventive care, maternal care, and other essential benefits to compete alongside high-quality ACA-authorized policies. In addition, Bloomberg's policy will require that all insurance plans meet the standards set under the ACA like covering maternal care and pre-existing conditions.
Bloomberg also made clear that he is ready to defend the ACA in the face of a lawsuit brought by Texas and other states threatening to overturn the nation's health care law. Tennessee faces a uniquely difficult health care situation with its diabetes, cardiovascular, and hypertension rates among the highest in the nation. The state, which has about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees, is one of 14 states that has not expanded the program under the ACA, and critics say the block-grant model puts the most vulnerable at risk if the state faces an economic downturn or increases restrictions on Medicaid enrollment.
To reinforce this message, the Bloomberg campaign also released ""Done It Before"" — a new national digital ad focused on health care which begins airing today in Super Tuesday states like Tennessee. The ad presents a sharp contrast between Mike Bloomberg as a ""doer"" versus President Trump as ""destroyer.""
Additional key components of Mike's plan include:

Eliminating ""surprise medical bills"" by requiring in-network hospitals to provide in-network care. Doctors and clinicians who operate within a network hospital will be required to accept in-network rates.
Capping out-of-network hospital prices at 200 percent of Medicare rates, in order to drive health care prices down overall.
Lowering drug costs by authorizing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, by eliminating the drug-company payments to pharmacy benefit managers, and by reforming the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit to encourage greater competition, and cap beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket costs at $2,000.

Medicare does not currently cover routine dental, vision, or hearing checkups. The proposed policy will add an additional supplemental Medicare benefit, similar to the drug benefit, to cover dental, vision, and hearing care. Beneficiaries would pay a separate premium, which would be $25 per month. To help low-income adults get dental care, Mike Bloomberg would expand Medicaid to cover dental care in all states to help provide preventive care for those who are least able to afford it.
Additionally, Bloomberg's policy addresses significant gaps in care in rural communities by expanding access to good health care with increased funding for rural hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments and increasing access to telehealth services. This would entail switching from a fee-for-service payment structure to paying rural hospitals a capitated amount to manage the care for the patients in their area. The proposal includes increasing federal grants to Community Health Centers, which provide free or low-cost care. Under Bloomberg's health care plan, Medicare would be required to cover more telehealth services, and get rid of facility fees when patients are given telehealth care at home.
""This plan identifies ways to lower costs and increase coverage, which is a high priority for consumers,"" said Kathleen Sebelius, former Governor and Former Health and Human Services Secretary. ""Mike also proposes continuing to provide consumer choice and market competition with regulatory controls, as well as restoring the fundamental framework of the Affordable Care Act which has been under attack in this administration.""
""When Mike was Mayor, he championed healthcare policies that greatly expanded healthcare for working families,"" said Al Aviles, former president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. ""The number of New Yorkers without health insurance fell nearly 50 percent during his administration. At the same time, he strongly supported improving care within our City's vast public healthcare system for seniors with chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure. I know Mike as a pragmatic, results-oriented leader with a deep commitment to ensuring affordable, high quality healthcare for everyone. And that's the type of leader we need.""
""American cities need a partner in Washington when it comes to health care,"" said Columbia South Carolina Mayor and Campaign Co-Chair Steve Benjamin. ""We can get the ball rolling, we can listen to our constituents. But, at the end of the day, improving our health care system requires national leadership. Mike will bring that.""
""Mike led the expansion of access to quality affordable health care for New Yorkers as mayor,"" said Dr. Michael Stocker, former chairman of the board of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and former CEO of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. ""Based on Mike's record, I am confident he can drive change at the national level to improve the health of all Americans.""
Today's announcement builds on Mike Bloomberg's record as a leading public health advocate spanning from his time as New York City Mayor, during which life expectancy in New York City increased by three years, to his philanthropic work, which includes taking on the tobacco companies in low-and middle income countries, combating the opioid crisis, fighting the youth e-cigarette epidemic, and much more.

"Bennet Campaign Press Release - Paul LeBlanc, President of Southern New Hampshire University, Endorses Michael Bennet for President",2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-press-release-paul-leblanc-president-southern-new-hampshire-university,"
The opinions expressed are neither the opinions of Southern New Hampshire University or its Trustees nor endorsed by Southern New Hampshire University.
MANCHESTER, NH — Paul LeBlanc, president of Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), and his wife, attorney and professor Patricia Findlen, today endorsed Michael Bennet for president of the United States. LeBlanc has led SNHU since 2003, growing the student body to over 135,000 learners and making it the nation's largest nonprofit provider of online higher education.
""I have spoken about education with numerous political leaders and none have possessed Michael's knowledge, thoughtfulness, and nuanced understanding of the issues,"" said LeBlanc. ""At a time of alarming wealth inequity and diminished opportunity for working people, Pat and I feel we need an education president. Someone who understands that education is still the single most powerful tool of social mobility and that it has sadly become part of the problem, not part of the solution, for far too many people.
""We also want someone who has been elected statewide in a purple state, who still thinks about finding the common ground that binds us as Americans. Michael is as comfortable talking to a Colorado rancher or miner as he is talking to an academic or community organizer. He has a natural feel for people and reminds us of their essential goodness. We admire his idealism, even as he brings a roll-up-the-sleeves practicality in getting to work and making things better.
""On the most fundamental level, he's a good man. I want to trust and admire the person leading the country. Yes, that's a question of integrity and morality, and it's also a question of respect for who the person is as a spouse, as a parent, as a neighbor. Trusted friends in Colorado told us years ago that we should pay attention to their senator. We have and what we discovered about Michael has earned our support.""
Bennet recently completed a five-day tour of New Hampshire, including stops in Salem, Bedford, Concord, Andover, Gorham, Lancaster, North Conway, West Ossipee, Dover, and Manchester. He has announced plans to host 50 town halls in the Granite State between now and the first in the nation primary, and returns on Friday for eight more town halls.
""Paul is one of the premier educational innovators in the country, and it's an honor to stand with him and Pat in the fight to restore opportunity for every American child,"" said Bennet. ""Together, I look forward to sharing my plan to bring integrity back to the White House with every primary voter in the Granite State.""
Bennet represents Colorado in the Senate, but he has not spent a lifetime in politics. He turned around failing businesses in the private sector and improved outcomes for kids as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. Bennet is the only candidate in this race who has won two national elections in a swing state. He has released comprehensive, field-leading proposals to provide high-quality, affordable health care with a public option, reward hard work, fix our broken political system, and tackle climate change by working with our farmers and ranchers.

(SAN FRANCISCO, December 19, 2019) –– On Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer participated in an unprecedented virtual Presidential Youth Town Hall hosted by the High School Democrats of America, College Democrats of America, and Young Democrats of America. Steyer's Youth Town Hall was the first of its kind to proactively reach out to the youth community and give them a platform to discuss the topics most pressing to them.
During the town hall, Steyer took questions from young Americans on climate, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, student debt, and affordable housing. He has been fighting for progressive issues and the youth mobilization for a decade.
""In 2018, so last year, NextGen did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history. We went into 38 congressional districts held by Republicans and more than doubled the turnout of people under 30. We can measure that and 33 of the districts flipped,"" Steyer said during the town hall. ""So to me, what that says is, I understand how critical participation of people between 18 and 35 is. I believe that next year's presidential election really will be the one that determines the next generation.""
Below are the highlights from the town hall:

Statement by Tom Steyer Responding to the Federal Appeals Court Strike Down of the ACA's Individual Mandate,2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00,Tom Steyer,/documents/statement-tom-steyer-responding-the-federal-appeals-court-strike-down-the-acas-individual,"
(LOS ANGELES, December 19, 2019) — Yesterday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the federal health insurance mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act, calling it unconstitutional. This decision, from a predominantly conservative bench, further imperils health care for millions of Americans, who already face significant financial barriers to medical and pharmaceutical access. As part of his 5 Rights Agenda, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer will fight to make health care a constitutional right for all Americans. He will also make appointing judges who will defend workers and families a priority of his administration.
Steyer released the following statement:
""Yesterday's court decision will hurt millions of hard-working Americans throughout this country. The United States Supreme Court already upheld the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate in 2012. It is constitutionally compliant and it provides essential care to millions. The Trump administration's relentless attack on health care will disproportionately hurt lower income families and communities of color.
""Thankfully California's elected leaders have enacted a state individual mandate, and I applaud Attorney General Becerra's decision to appeal this to the highest court in the land. My health care plan will protect the ACA's key provisions, expand its benefits for millions of Americans, and create a new public option to give Americans the choice of a quality, affordable plan. This court decision is yet another example of the importance of electing a progressive Democrat in 2020 to reverse the rightwing polarization of the federal judiciary.""

Ad Highlights Sanders is Only Leading Candidate Funded Exclusively by Grassroots Donations
DES MOINES – Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Wednesday ahead of the Democratic debate launched a new TV ad in Iowa calling out a corrupt political system that allows billionaires to buy elections and touting Sanders as the only leading candidate funded exclusively by grassroots donations.
WATCH: ""Billionaires""
The ad features footage of Sanders' March to End Corporate Greed, which brought over 1,000 supporters together in Des Moines. Sanders' Iowa polling average is currently at the highest level since May as support continues to expand across the state.
""Billionaires"" is Sanders' seventh ad to run in Iowa, following ""Fights For Us,"" ""Belongs To Us,"" ""Hope,"" ""Iowa First,"" ""Big Us"" and ""For All."" All seven ads have been produced entirely in-house by Bernie 2020 staff.
The full ad transcript is below:
My opponents would tell you that campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful don't have an impact.
Why do you think these CEOs are making contributions? When you make those contributions you're first in line to get your concerns taken care of.
I believe in democracy, not billionaires owning the system.
Our campaign is funded by the working people of this country.
We need to take on all of the corporate elite. We need a government that works for working families, not just big campaign contributors.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.

SAN ANTONIO, TX (December 18, 2019) – Following the House vote to impeach Donald Trump, presidential candidate, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro reacted with the following statement:

The House vote came on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power and a second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress. Secretary Castro was the second candidate to deliver a reaction, via Twitter, following Senator Bernie Sanders.

""The contrast between President Trump and the Democrats couldn't be more clear. While the President rallied with tens of thousands of citizens in Michigan and celebrated the greatness and success of America, Democrats in D.C. completed their cold, calculated, and concocted 3-year impeachment sham and voted against 63 million Americans. And the only part of the vote that was bipartisan was in opposition. The President is just getting stronger while support for the Democrats' political theater has faded. Undeterred, President Trump keeps racking up victories for the American people, who will respond by resoundingly re-electing him next November.""

The ad features footage of Sanders' March to End Corporate Greed, which brought over 1,000 supporters together in Des Moines. Sanders' Iowa polling average is currently at the highest level since May as support continues to expand across the state.
""Billionaires"" is Sanders' seventh ad to run in Iowa, following ""Fights For Us,"" ""Belongs To Us,"" ""Hope,"" ""Iowa First,"" ""Big Us"" and ""For All."" All seven ads have been produced entirely in-house by Bernie 2020 staff.
The full ad transcript is below:
My opponents would tell you that campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful don't have an impact.
Why do you think these CEOs are making contributions? When you make those contributions you're first in line to get your concerns taken care of.
I believe in democracy, not billionaires owning the system.
Our campaign is funded by the working people of this country.
We need to take on all of the corporate elite. We need a government that works for working families, not just big campaign contributors.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.

SAN ANTONIO, TX (December 18, 2019) – Following the House vote to impeach Donald Trump, presidential candidate, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro reacted with the following statement:
""Mitch McConnell has already said he's ""not an impartial juror"" and is in cahoots with the White House. He should recuse himself, and the Senate should do its constitutional duty. Remove Donald Trump from office.""
Earlier in the day, Secretary Castro tweeted about the vote, ""Today Congress must put patriotism over politics, hold this president accountable for his actions, and send a message that no one is above the law. The evidence is clear. Donald Trump violated his oath of office and abused his power. Impeach him.""

Statement by Elizabeth Warren - My Plan to Fight Global Financial Corruption,2019-12-17T00:00:00+00:00,Elizabeth Warren,/documents/statement-elizabeth-warren-my-plan-fight-global-financial-corruption,"
By Elizabeth Warren
When the Panama Papers were released in 2016, the world learned how Russian president Vladimir Putin had channeled billions from state-owned banks and companies to his friends and relatives. A distant cousin with a mid-level job at a shipping company, a childhood friend who worked as a butcher — all with hundreds of millions in mystery assets parked offshore in their names.
But Putin isn't alone in using shady financial tactics to mask his corruption.
The Panama Papers also revealed that family members of eight current or former members of China's politburo, including the brother-in-law of current president Xi Jinping, stashed wealth in offshore companies. The prime minister of Pakistan's children were linked to luxury flats in London owned by an anonymous offshore trust. The soccer star Lionel Messi and his father created a Panamanian shell company to evade taxation. The prime minister of Iceland was caught sheltering assets in a secret offshore company and forced to resign.
And the Panama Papers were just the tip of the iceberg.
When corrupt government officials stole over $4.5 billion from a Malaysian state development fund? They stashed the money in overseas shelters.
When the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout needed to finance his deals? He set up shell companies in Delaware.
And when President Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort wanted to disguise illicit gains he made for unregistered lobbying on behalf of Ukraine? He stashed it in real estate in his wife and daughter's names or owned by shell companies.
What all these cases have in common is the use of legal loopholes and shadowy financial middlemen to obscure assets, or in some cases the proceeds of criminal activity, from law enforcement and government oversight.
In total, laundered money represents 2 to 5 percent of global GDP, or as much as $2 trillion annually. And the flow of illicit money and lack of financial transparency are not just problems for developing countries or systems exploited by autocrats — they also affect the United States and its interests around the world. Dark money is used to bankroll repressive and hostile regimes. Illicit networks foster corruption, inequality, kleptocracy, and financial crime. Shell corporations, complex money laundering schemes, and inadequate international financial controls enable nuclear proliferation, terrorism, drug and human trafficking, and tax avoidance. All are major threats to our security, our democracy, and our way of life.
Rather than fighting for transparency, Donald Trump has spent his career embracing shady deals. Trump has repeatedly partnered with shady actors on real estate deals that reek of money laundering, corruption, and fraud. More than one-fifth of all Trump's U.S. condo sales since the 1980s have been all-cash transactions with shell companies — red flags that often indicate money laundering. At one of Trump's towers in Florida, more than 60 percent of its units are owned by shell companies. And it doesn't stop with real estate — over half of Trump's more than 500 companies are registered in Delaware, taking advantage of state loopholes that exempt LLCs from publishing their financial information or disclosing their ownership structure.
And Trump isn't alone in exploiting legal loopholes. Tax avoidance by the wealthiest Americans has spawned an entire industry of accountants, lawyers, and other enablers. This diverts hundreds of billions from the U.S. Treasury each year — money that could be used to invest in our schools, our infrastructure, and our democracy — and much of it is legal. And unfortunately, moving dark money in our country is all too easy. In fact, in some U.S. states, establishing a shell company to launder money is “easier than getting a library card” and never requires proving one's identity.
I've introduced the most ambitious set of domestic anti-corruption reforms since Watergate to clean up our government. But we must go further. Our domestic challenges are compounded by a global network that connects secretive shell companies, complicated trusts, middlemen and enablers that specialize in papering suspicious transactions, and states and countries that profit from a lack of transparency. To truly root out corruption, we must also tackle the flow of dark money around the world.
That's why today, I'm introducing my plan to fight global financial corruption by reforming our global financial system, cracking down on shady practices by the ultra-wealthy, and preventing corruption at home and abroad.
Fighting Financial Corruption At Home
Financial corruption is a global problem — but the solutions start here at home. The United States is at the center of the global financial system and shapes global financial rules. And as long as countries, companies, and people want to access our markets and our dollars, we have leverage to strengthen global transparency. Here's what we can do.
Require “beneficial ownership” disclosure. Shell companies — businesses that mask their beneficiaries or that exist only on paper — allow individuals to hide both their identities and the origins of their money. And as long as U.S. laws and regulations do not require the disclosure of information about a company's owners, other U.S. efforts to tackle financial crime will suffer: our rules will be undermined, and other countries will continue to use that as an excuse to avoid tightening their own rules.
I'll work with Congress to enact anti-money laundering reforms and update basic financial integrity requirements designed to fight illicit financial transactions, including collecting standardized identifying information about the ultimate beneficial ownership of every corporate entity created across the country. This will increase law enforcement's understanding of the web of companies operating in the United States, and help to end our country's status as a global facilitator of money laundering. And while we should encourage innovation in financial technologies, like cryptocurrencies, we must also ensure they are not used for money laundering.
Gather better data on cross-border financial flows. While the United States is central to the global flow of payments, we have too little information on the money coursing through our system, including laundered money and criminal assets.
To increase oversight and control over payments, a Warren administration will issue rules requiring U.S. financial institutions to report information about individual cross-border payments, and seek legislation to allow financial institutions to obtain information on the true beneficial owner of a foreign entity involved in a payment. More and better data will help highlight and uncover patterns of malign activity and deter bad actors from using the global financial system. And the combination of beneficial ownership reforms and more cross-border transaction reporting will force more opaque jurisdictions to improve their practices, raising global standards.
Expand anti-bribery law authorities. U.S. companies working abroad are prohibited from paying bribes to win a contract or do business. This requirement protects the integrity of American companies and ensures that they can't engage in corruption abroad or bring it back to the United States — but the law does not go far enough to protect American workers abroad who want to do the right thing and refuse to pay bribes demanded by foreign officials. And our laws only penalize U.S. companies that pay the bribes, not the foreign officials who demand and take them.
A Warren administration will work with Congress to expand our ability to hold accountable foreign officials who extort American companies. I'll assign Foreign Service Officers to focus directly on addressing corruption in countries at the highest risk. And I'll work with Congress to toughen anti-bribery laws to make sure that the bribes extorted and paid outside of the United States, even when there is no U.S. company involved, cannot be laundered through our banking system. These steps will send a strong signal to the world that the United States will not tolerate corruption or enable foreign criminals to hide their ill-gotten gains in our financial system. It will also make U.S. companies and their employees more competitive and resilient in demanding transparency and fair dealings in their work abroad.
Promote international cooperation to combat tax evasion. A Warren administration will prioritize coordinating global efforts to crack down on tax evasion. The Obama administration's Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was a big step in the right direction, and I will build on it as president. My trade plan commits to using America's leverage to press for more international coordination on tax evasion, including by requiring other countries to join global tax evasion efforts as a precondition of securing a special trade deal with America. I am also committed to substantially increasing funding for the IRS so we can enforce the laws we already have and make sure the rich are paying what they owe. Finally, my Ultra-Millionaire Tax is specifically designed to reduce opportunities for avoidance and evasion, imposing a minimum mandatory audit rate for the wealthiest taxpayers and a hefty “exit tax” if extremely wealthy American citizens try to avoid the tax by renouncing their American citizenship.
Expand and institutionalize real estate disclosure requirements. While foreign investment has dipped in the face of Trump's trade wars, U.S. real estate remains attractive for illicit money from all over the world. It's a stable investment that generally maintains or grows in value — and it gives corrupt oligarchs and dictators a potential escape route if they're ousted from their home countries. But this money drives out honest purchasers and makes cities hotbeds for dirty, unproductive cash. In one part of New York City, for example, the Census Bureau estimated that 30 percent of apartments are unoccupied most of the year.
As president, I'll make permanent existing requirements to identify and disclose owners to authorities, including through Geographic Targeting Orders, which can be issued to require financial institutions to report to the Treasury on any transaction above a specified dollar amount within a specified geographic area. And I'll broaden the locations and the types of real estate covered by disclosure requirements.
Update campaign finance laws to limit foreign interference and bring dark money into the light. Citizens United cleared the way for massive super PACs and dark money organizations to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars into our politics on behalf of largely unknown donors. And while federal law prohibits foreign individuals from contributing to campaigns, a loophole still allows foreign-owned or foreign-funded companies to influence American elections. The results are predictable: a Chinese-owned company that bought its way into the 2016 Republican primary; Russian nationals and Kremlin-connected businesses that spent money on an expansive effort to use internet ads to influence American public opinion. And none of this violates existing campaign finance laws.
I have a plan to get big money out of politics by closing the existing loopholes by prohibiting U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, firms with meaningful foreign ownership, and trade associations that receive money from those entities from spending money in American elections. My plan will also modernize campaign finance law for the digital age by including internet ads in rules regulating electioneering communications. And to bring dark money into the light, every organization that makes an election-related expenditure — including dark-money organizations — should be required to promptly disclose their large donors. Super PACs and other dark money groups must provide enough information about the sources of their money that the American people can trace it back to the ultimate individuals and entities that are funding them — not just the shell organizations used to conceal those sources. We must overturn the Supreme Court's decisions in Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United through a constitutional amendment in order to end the corruption of our campaigns and elections. But we can take steps right now to increase transparency and ensure that foreign governments and companies are unable to influence our elections.
Expand enforcement against financial institutions. For too long, we've threatened to punish major international banks, but failed to follow through when clear evidence of wrongdoing surfaced. Settlements are often just slaps on the wrist — when Mexican drug cartels allegedly used accounts at Wachovia to launder at least $373 billion, for example, the bank only had to pay $160 million, less than half of one percent of the money laundered. And under the Trump administration, white collar prosecutions have dropped to their lowest levels in over 30 years.
My anti-corruption plan will shut the revolving door between financial institutions and the regulators who are supposed to oversee U.S. transparency and money-laundering efforts. Giant banks will be banned from hiring senior government officials for four years after those officials leave office. My plan will also prevent financial institutions from using industry-funded fake research to mislead federal regulators during the rulemaking process — and subject them to potential prosecution if they mislead regulators with “research” they know to be false. And I'll make enforcing existing transparency and anti-money laundering laws a major priority for a Warren Treasury and DOJ.
Clamp down on dark money enablers. U.S.-based enablers are often just as responsible for corruption as the kleptocrats whose money they manage. The international flow of illicit money thrives thanks to the lawyers, financial services providers, accountants, and real estate services providers who bridge the divide between the dark economy and the clean one. They do so through “layering,” creating a maze of bank accounts and shell companies offshore and in the United States, until the original source of the funds is entirely obscured. For example, when the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness asked several law firms how to anonymously move significant sums of money in ways that should have raised major red flags, in all but one case the lawyers offered suggestions on how to do it. Moreover, big financial players like hedge funds and private equity firms are untouched by many anti-money laundering regulations — as are real estate service providers servicing all cash deals and company formation agents.
The Trump administration has largely looked the other way on these issues. That ends when I'm president. I will immediately issue rules to ensure that all available tools are fully deployed against the enablement industry, closing gaps that allow service providers to profit off gray areas. And once these new regulations are in effect, we'll impose stiff penalties when service providers break them.
Fighting Financial Corruption Abroad
The global financial system is only as strong as its weakest link. While we have much to do to get our own house in order, American regulators cannot succeed by working alone; we need to take a stronger stance on financial transparency internationally as well. My administration will be committed to a multilateral approach to financial transparency, working aggressively with allies and international institutions willing and able to collaborate in this fight.
Work with partners. Corruption and illicit finance are worldwide problems, and we're not alone in wanting to fight these dangers. My administration will make transparency and reasserting control over finance a central plank of its multilateral and bilateral agendas. We'll use our leverage at international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to help strengthen countries' legal frameworks against money laundering, and make strong anti-money laundering legal frameworks a central requirement for receiving assistance from international financial institutions. We will also seek to combine efforts with other countries concerned about these issues — in Asia, for example, our allies are natural partners in tightening money-laundering laws to address the financing of North Korea's nuclear program. Aligning goals and, where possible, rules, will close out the gaps between jurisdictions that bad actors are so skilled at exploiting.
Keep a scorecard. The United States is a major market and a sought-after trading partner. We can use this status as leverage in the fight for financial transparency globally. I've already established a set of standards countries must meet as a precondition for any trade agreement with America, including recognizing core labor, climate and human rights commitments. But to ensure that American companies and American workers can compete fairly around the world, we must address corruption and financial transparency as well. Working with the international Financial Action Task Force, the inter-governmental watchdog, a Warren administration will also maintain a list of minimum required anti-corruption laws, policies, and standards that countries must have in place to receive preferential treatment from the U.S. government in trade and other agreements. We'll phase in these standards and work with partners to meet them, including by providing incentives for countries making meaningful progress.
Expand technical assistance. Tracking and fighting corruption and illicit finance takes resources, experience, and expertise. The United States has all three — but some countries lack the capacity to bolster the soundness of their financial system even when they want to do so. A Warren administration will work with partners and allies to raise standards and conduct enforcement. In partnership with international institutions, we will invest in assisting counterparts abroad with model laws and policies, training on the ground, and continued monitoring to help stand up strong financial transparency controls. Technical assistance will raise global standards and practices. It also fosters economic development abroad, allowing companies and investors to place greater trust in the anti-corruption and financial transparency regulations in place. And we should ensure that countries that do strengthen their rules and comply with U.S. sanctions reap the benefits of cooperation.
Target corrupt kleptocrats. Together with our partners and allies, the United States has taken the lead in sanctioning and holding accountable those who abuse human rights and or facilitate nuclear proliferation around the world. We must similarly take the lead in standing up to corrupt and kleptocratic businesses and regimes, shining a light on financial corruption that undermines democracy and development around the world. This means investigating, naming, and shaming corrupt individuals and their criminal rings — including through targeted sanctions on individuals and by excluding them from the financial system — limiting their ability to steal from their countries and stash the money overseas. This can also be a basis for working with allies, coordinating law enforcement efforts to pursue corrupt and kleptocratic activity. And it will incentivize jurisdictions to bring their legal frameworks up to speed with international standards.
The flow of dark money puts good governance, the free exchange of ideas, and our national security at risk. As long as individuals and corporations can launder stolen funds or contraband through real estate, luxury goods, or tax havens, both equality and economic growth suffer. This free-for-all environment harms governments' efforts to boost their citizens' standard of living and even drives up the cost of living.
Without action, the problem will only get worse. Around the world — in places including Chile, Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran — protesters are rising up against corruption and economic inequality. The United States must stand with them. Financial transparency is a necessary component of any responsible domestic and international policy agenda, but international controls are only as strong as their weakest links. The United States has the means to compel change, and we must lead by example.

"Bennet Campaign Press Release - Bennet for America Announces $700,000 Fundraising Push to Compete in New Hampshire, Including New Ad Series Introducing Michael Bennet to Voters",2019-12-17T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-press-release-bennet-for-america-announces-700000-fundraising-push-compete,"
DENVER — Bennet for America today announced that it needs to raise $700,000 by January 16th to have the resources to compete in New Hampshire, including for the launch of a new ad series introducing Michael Bennet to Granite Staters. The campaign shared a preview of the first ad — titled ""Opposite of Trump"" — which it intends to air on television and through digital ads when it hits the new goal.
Bennet recently announced his commitment to hold 50 town halls in the Granite State in the final 10 weeks before the primary, and the campaign has doubled down there, with more staff, office space, and endorsements.
In a memo to top supporters, Campaign Manager Daniel Barash outlined the urgency and opportunity of the new effort dubbed the New Hampshire Investment Strategy: ""As other candidates have left the race or stumbled in the last few weeks, Michael has doubled down and gained momentum. Now is our moment. We have planted our flag in New Hampshire, but we need your help right now to have the resources to compete there.""
The campaign outlined how fluid and open the presidential race remains, noting that just 33% of New Hampshire Democratic voters have made up their minds, and that because of strategic and judicious budgeting, Bennet has been able to outlast other candidates and make it to the ""starting line"" of the 2020 contest.
However, Barash notes, ""without a significant uptick in fundraising, we will not have the resources to fully capitalize on the groundwork that has been laid to compete."" The $700,000 New Hampshire Investment Strategy will go toward promotion of the 50 town halls push, as well funds for TV and digital advertising, more field staff, and a direct mail program. The new ad series announced by the campaign would aim to introduce Bennet to the many voters who are just now tuning in to the race and looking for a candidate who can beat Trump and build a stronger future for the next generation.
""To beat Donald Trump, we need the opposite of Donald Trump. That's what I am,"" says Bennet in the new ad. ""Every decision I make is for the kids I served as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. … So if you want a president who's focused on the next generation, and not just the next tweet, then give me a look.""
Read a transcript of the ad below.
To beat Donald Trump, we need the opposite of Donald Trump. That's what I am.
""Oh, no, I've heard that voice before!""
Trump has divided our country like no other president. I'll unite the country, and we'll fix it together.
Trump's the first president to take health care away from millions. I have a plan to cover everyone in three years and lower costs, without bankrupting the system.
Trump is a pathological liar. I'll tell you the truth, even when it's hard.
Trump doesn't care about your kids or mine. Every decision I make is for the kids I served as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. I'll wake up every morning thinking about you and your family, and how to make your lives better.
So if you want a president who's focused on the next generation, and not just the next tweet, then give me a look. I'm Michael Bennet, and I'm running for president.

Biden Campaign Press Release - Former Ohio Governor and Congressman Ted Strickland Endorses Joe Biden For President,2019-12-17T00:00:00+00:00,Joseph R. Biden,/documents/biden-campaign-press-release-former-ohio-governor-and-congressman-ted-strickland-endorses,"
Columbus, Ohio — Today, former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
""I've known and admired Joe Biden for many years and I believe he's among the most ethical and decent people in public life. Joe's always worked to build a stronger middle class and to protect America's working families. And, because of his vast experience, he understands what it's going to take to rebuild the backbone of our nation and give everyone a shot at the American Dream.
""Being able to navigate Congress, while leading the country forward is a skill that few politicians have – and Joe has proven he can do both. From his time in the Senate and White House, Joe has fought for education, health care and living wage jobs. He's not just a talker, he's a doer. His record shows it. There's no doubt in my mind, Joe Biden will do the same thing as President.
""I believe it's no exaggeration to say that Joe Biden has more foreign policy experience than all of the other candidates combined. When he's elected president, there will be a sigh of relief heard across the world. Leaders of other countries, both friend and foe, will know that our nation once again has an honest, and trustworthy President representing us and our national values.
""Finally, Joe can compete and win in states like Ohio. States that are critical to not just winning the Oval Office, but creating tail winds that will send more Democratic Senators and House members to Congress. That's why I'm proudly endorsing him for President.""
During his tenure as Governor of Ohio, Strickland heavily invested in the infrastructure and economic development of Ohio — propelling the state's ranking for 'business climate' from 38th to 11th in the nation and from 7th to 1st in the Midwest. Additionally, under Strickland's administration, Ohio public schools rose in ranking from 27th to 5th in the nation.
Strickland joins a bench of nearly 40 current and former elected officials and community leaders from across Ohio, including Congressman Tim Ryan, former Congressman Edward Feighan, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, former Columbus City Councilmember Mary Jo Hudson, State Senator Herceal Craig, and Youngstown Mayor Tito Brown. Biden's endorsements in the Buckeye State highlight his strength in a pivotal battleground state and ability to build a broad, diverse, and winning coalition across the country that ensures we beat Donald Trump.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 900 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.

Des Moines, Iowa — Today, 25 Iowa leaders — ranging from mayors and Democratic party chairs to Iowa state legislators and faith leaders — endorsed Joe Biden for President.
""Throughout his years of public service and in the Obama-Biden Administration, Joe has never changed – he's always been a man of integrity, empathy and character,"" said Ritchie Kurtenbach, President of the Waterloo Building and Construction Trades. ""In this time of great peril, we can't afford a rookie in the White House – Joe is the most qualified candidate in this race hands down. There is no learning curve with Joe, and his eight years as Barack Obama's Vice President has made him ready to be Commander in Chief on day one. We can't gamble in this election – we must beat Donald Trump – so I hope Iowans will join me caucusing for Joe on February 3.""
""I endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States,"" said Iowa State Senator Herman Quirmbach of Ames. ""We live in divisive times and a dangerous world. America needs a new President, one who can heal the divisions at home, repair the trust and cooperation of our allies abroad, and regain respect for America and America's values from friend and foe alike. Joe Biden's vast international experience will be especially useful in reopening foreign markets for Iowa's farmers, whose income has been cut in half since the high point of the Obama-Biden Administration. We need Biden's experience at home, too, where for decades he has been effective at passing vital legislation to protect women from violence, to extend educational opportunities, and to expand access to health care for tens of millions. Most of all, we need a man of Joe Biden's character, a man of true warmth and compassion, a man who will restore dignity to the Office of President of the United States.""
""I stand with Joe Biden because I know his heart — for years, he's been fighting for DREAMers because he knows it's the right thing to do and that all Americans just want a fair shot to succeed,"" said Alma Puga, President of LULAC Council 381 in Denison. ""As president, Joe will repair our country after Donald Trump's cruel immigration policies, restore America's values, welcome refugees and provide immigrants with a path to citizenship. Joe has my support because he's not only the best choice for president, he's also the best candidate to beat Donald Trump next November.""
""I believe Vice President Joe Biden is the most qualified person running for President and when he speaks on foreign policy, he speaks with the moral clarity and strength that shows he is ready to be Commander in Chief on day one,"" said Brian Schoenjahn, former Mayor and Iowa State Senator from Arlington. ""Now is not the time for on the job training in the White House — it hasn't worked with Donald Trump, and there is far too much on the line to gamble in this election. It is time for decency, honesty, and integrity in the presidency. From building on Obamacare to working with allies to combat climate change, Joe brings dignified leadership both abroad and at home. I am honored to stand by Joe and ready to caucus for him in February.""
""I've known Vice President Biden for the last twelve years and what has always stood out the most is his experience, wisdom and judgment,"" said Maxine Bussanmas, Mayor of Bevington. ""I have seen firsthand his leadership and his ability to be a steady voice for working families. We need a candidate who will heal and unify this nation. Joe has brought folks together his whole life – and he's the only candidate in this race that can appeal to folks in small towns and large, to Democrats and Republicans, and to people of all walks of life. He is building a broad base of voters, and I am proud to endorse Joe and I hope that Iowans will join me.""
""Over the years, I've had the honor and privilege of praying with both President Obama and Vice President Biden on several occasions – and in Joe, I saw a man of character, faith, and integrity,"" said Rev. Steve Perkins of Bethel AME Church in Davenport. ""From foreign policy and climate change to jobs and justice, Joe has an ambitious agenda to steer our country back on track and give every American the dignity they deserve. Joe also has a unique ability to unite our country and bring people together across party lines, color or creeds. I am proud to support Joe Biden for President and will work with members of the community to help him win the Iowa Caucus.""

Biden Campaign Press Release - National Association of Government Employees (NAGE) Endorses Joe Biden for President,2019-12-17T00:00:00+00:00,Joseph R. Biden,/documents/biden-campaign-press-release-national-association-government-employees-nage-endorses-joe,"
Last week, the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), a part of SEIU that represents health care workers, first responders, nurses, law enforcement officials, office professionals, and public servants across the country, announced their endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States:
NAGE Endorses Democratic Nominee for President
The 47-person National Executive Board of the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE) has unanimously voted to endorse former Vice President Joseph Biden in his race for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States of America.
NAGE represents over 100,000 public and private sector employees in forty states. NAGE represents federal, state, county and municipal employees, along with EMTs and Paramedics in both the public and private sectors.
NAGE members include first responders who are police officers, fire fighters, and EMS professionals, along with nurses and other hospital workers, attorneys and other white-collar workers, clerical employees, and a variety of other public workers who keep the United States safe and providing the services that keep our governments running.

Joe Biden knows what it takes to steer our country through the next Presidential term. Joe Biden has worked with and cared for our members for a long time, and he has the energy and wisdom to move this country forward,"" said NAGE National President David J. Holway.
NAGE Executive Vice President Theresa McGoldrick said on the endorsement, ""Our members and local leaders seek candidates that have an open mind, an open heart and an open door. Vice President Biden has a proven track record in those three areas.""

Biden Campaign Press Release - Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham Endorses Joe Biden for President of the United States,2019-12-16T00:00:00+00:00,Joseph R. Biden,/documents/biden-campaign-press-release-mayor-randall-woodfin-birmingham-endorses-joe-biden-for,"
Today, Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, Alabama released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
""Joe Biden is the bridge between the future of the Democratic Party and the most successful Democratic administration of my lifetime. 2020 is a vital year for Democrats where redistricting, House and Senate majorities, competitive gubernatorial races, and the composition of our state legislatures are at stake. We need someone at the top of the ticket who can bring the broadest coalition possible to the polls in places like Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, as well as in the Rust Belt states that we lost in 2016. That person is Joe Biden.
""Joe is a former local elected official, so he understands the challenges that I face as Mayor, and he has an agenda for job creation, inclusive economic development, affordable housing, and infrastructure that will help move cities like Birmingham forward. He was the only candidate who convened Southern mayors in response to our Agenda for the South that was circulated earlier this year. And, his campaign is the only campaign that has consistently communicated directly with Southern mayors on the issues that directly impact our cities. This is the kind of partner that Birmingham needs in Washington, and I enthusiastically endorse Vice President Biden.""
A native of Birmingham, Mayor Woodfin is the former President of the Birmingham City School Board and a former Assistant City Attorney for the City of Birmingham. Woodfin is the youngest mayor in Birmingham elected in more than 100 years. Mayor Woodfin joined Vice President Biden last month in Atlanta, Georgia with mayors from across the South to discuss the issues facing their communities.
Mayor Woodfin joins two other elected officials from Alabama — Senator Doug Jones and State Representative Juandalynn Givan — in supporting Biden, adding to a growing list of leaders from across the South who are joining Team Joe.
To date, Biden for President has drawn support from more than 900 national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, mayors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.

"Remarks on the National Economy in Iowa City, Iowa",2019-12-16T00:00:00+00:00,Tom Steyer,/documents/remarks-the-national-economy-iowa-city-iowa,"
The other candidates have a big red ""X"" on their calendars for the caucuses. I had another date on mine … yesterday, December 15th. I spent it at my Aunt Betsy's. She's been in Iowa City most of her life, and she turned 100 years old yesterday.
It's always great to be here in Iowa City. Look, these are uncertain times, for Iowans — and for all Americans. This election is the biggest in our lives. As we round out the year, we Democrats have to take a hard look at ourselves, and ask: how do we win?
Last week, Donald Trump stood before the Israeli-American Council, and said:
And I quote: ""You are brutal killers. You are not nice people at all. But you have to vote for me … even if you don't like me – you're going to be my biggest supporters ... because you'll be out of business in 15 minutes if the Democrats get in.""
His words were hateful, antisemitic, and his premise is totally false. But beyond the bigotry, his words do reveal his entire 2020 strategy.
To win, Donald Trump will stake his campaign on his so-called strength: the economy. And here's what American voters must understand: despite his racism, his lies, and his impeachable crimes — if Democrats don't nominate someone who can go head-to-head with him on the economy, Donald Trump will win in 2020.
Look, I have a lot of respect for the four leading Democratic candidates in this race. But here's the truth: none of them — not Vice President Biden, not Senator Warren, not Senator Sanders, not Mayor Pete — have built or run a successful, international business. None of them have a private sector track record of creating jobs — none of them have first-hand experience growing wealth and prosperity.
I do. I started my business from scratch, in a one-room office with no windows. For nearly three decades, I grew my company into a multi-billion dollar international enterprise. I spent 30 years studying our economy, and economies around the world — and I know what makes them work.
The Democratic Party — and America — needs a nominee who can go to Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and places all over this country — and credibly talk about growth and prosperity … a nominee who can deliver a compelling narrative that puts people over profits … a nominee who can square up to Donald Trump and actually beat him on the economy.
I believe that my experience and my track record make me the Democrat best prepared to be that nominee.
Let's be clear: In 2016, we nominated the most experienced and qualified candidate in history ... A woman I greatly admire. And Donald Trump still prevailed.
If Democrats want to win in 2020, we need to realize that Donald Trump is a different kind of candidate, who presents different challenges than anyone who has come before him.
Conventional wisdom won't work against Trump. We need new thinking, and new leadership. And we know this will come down to the economy. Presidential elections always do.
So let's start by acknowledging another truth: decades of unchecked capitalism have failed. And while the Trump presidency is making it worse — the answer is not socialism. No, the real answer is to make sure the American people write the rules — not corporations.
The real answer to historic inequality is NOT a government takeover of huge parts of our economy, but rather, direct investment in the American people. We need to put people in the driver's seat, and then let the innovation and competition of the private sector drive growth and prosperity. THAT is how we build prosperity — and opportunity — for all of us, not just the top 1%.
But before we talk about the path forward — we have to talk about how we got here. The state of America's economy isn't Trump's failure alone – it's the result of decades of cruel, anti-worker Republican policies.
Republicans told us that trickle-down economics would grow opportunity for everyone. But they lied. Instead, they've hoarded all the money for themselves — and not a drop has trickled down to the American people. Money might be flowing — but it's siphoned off at the top.
Over the past 40 years, the Republican Party has pursued an aggressive, calculated assault on working families.
Their playbook is simple: cut their own taxes, weaken labor unions, starve education funding, slash healthcare spending, shred environmental protections, and put big business in charge of our democracy. The result? … Historic levels of inequality, with all the gains of the past 40 years going to the wealthiest among us.
In 2020, Democrats have the chance to end this. But as I said: only if we nominate a Democrat who can take the fight to Republicans, and to Donald Trump, on the economy … that's how this election will be won or lost. Trump's only path to victory — his chosen path — is to play an economic shell game long enough to win re-election — and then walk away and let someone else clean up his mess in 2024.
Instead of the failed trickle-down theory of economics — we need a new democratic narrative of how we prosper and thrive, together. As democrats, we have to shake the Republican lie that economic growth must sacrifice economic justice. Because that's just not true. In fact, longterm, fair, and fortified growth DEPENDS on a just economy.
This is the richest country on earth — but fewer and fewer people are able to climb out of poverty and live their American dream. While CEO pay has skyrocketed, workers' pay has stagnated — even while productivity keeps going up.
Yes — the American economy has grown … but that growth is directly tied to more productive American workers, who haven't seen any benefit of their productivity. To the single mom with two jobs, doing more work and having less to show for it — GDP means nothing.
To the young person freelancing in todays' gig economy to pay for health insurance — or the college student burdened by overpriced tuition — GDP means nothing.
The way we measure economic success in this country is broken. The wrong metrics — the averages — mask the truth … and we can't manage what we don't measure. High employment doesn't help if jobs don't pay enough to live on.
Economic growth doesn't matter if there's no wage growth to go along with it. And industry success is not success — when it's poisoning our families, destabilizing the planet, and robbing from our children's futures.
Among other things, we should be measuring economic mobility — the real opportunity for Americans to lift themselves up and improve their own lives. That's the American dream.
We need a nominee who knows how to fight inequality AND how to grow prosperity. As President, here are three key pieces of my plan to do both:
First, to attack inequality, America needs a Wealth Tax. This is where Mike Bloomberg and I disagree. There's been a historic, unjust redistribution of wealth over the last forty years — in the wrong direction. A wealth tax isn't a new burden — it's a long needed fix. And when we put that money to use productively — by investing it in education and research — we can build sustained, shared growth for the entire economy, not just those at the top.
Under my plan, anyone worth 32 million dollars or more will pay 1 cent more on the dollar. At 500 million, that goes up to 1 and a half cents. And at 1 billion dollars, that number hits 2 cents. Over a decade, that's 1.7 trillion dollars in tax revenue — which will go towards things like fixing healthcare, creating new jobs in a clean energy economy, and funding education. I've been calling for a wealth tax long before I was running for president — because it's the right thing to do.
Second, we need to be bold in how we balance the scales — and fix an unfair tax system that favors the wealthy, because the wealthy write the rules. That's why I plan to treat all taxable income the same — paychecks and investment income. I'll close the capital gains giveaway — because it's not right that those who work for a living pay more in taxes than those who make money off of passive investment.
And I'll use the revenue from passive-income tax increases to give a REAL tax break to working Americans … a 10 percent cut to millions of low income and middle class families. That's a tax break for 95 percent of Americans.
And third, I've put forward a ""people over profits"" economic plan, which calls for investing in the American people, and building upon the innovation and competition of our thriving private sector. That's how we'll spur growth and prosperity for all of us. My plan will create millions of good-paying, union jobs in every part of the country, and invest in education and research to bolster our greatest asset — the American people.
Republicans would have you believe, it's a zero sum game — that the total is fixed, and if you win, then your neighbor has to lose.
That's just not true.
We progressives know that nobody wins unless everybody does. We know that when one person reaches for their dream, it helps others do the same. We know that ""We're All in This Together,"" — is a much better philosophy than ""you're on your own.""
There's something else I have a track record on: I know what it takes to break the corporate stranglehold on our democracy — the same corporate takeover that keeps us from a government that's truly of, by, and for the people.
For 10 years, I've been organizing and empowering Americans to beat corporations and to take back our power. Every step of the way, organized labor has been my first and best partner. As president, I will defend, uphold, and continue the fight for workers' rights and the rights of all unions.
The Democratic Party needs to recognize that our fight is not just with Donald Trump. We are fighting 40 years of a poisonous republican narrative, a frame that says strong growth and opportunity for all can't coexist. That government is the bad guy, and tax breaks for the rich are somehow good for the middle class.
Just like Donald Trump's promises though — none of it is true.
Donald Trump promised to bring back manufacturing jobs, but passed a tax bill that shipped jobs overseas. His tax break for the wealthy hurts working people. His trade war alone has cost Iowans millions — and Iowa farm bankruptcies are at their highest since 2011.
Trump's pattern of fraud is simple: he's treating the American people, and the American economy, like one of his Atlantic City Casinos … running up the debt, flirting with bankruptcy, sticking us with the bill — and moving on to swindle his next mark.
You know, sometimes people ask me, you're a businessman, just like Donald Trump, … how are you different? Well, I'm here to tell you, that we couldn't be more different.
Donald inherited hundreds of millions from his dad, and lost it … bankruptcies, lost jobs, empty promises … He leaves failure and broken homes in his wake. He takes advantage of the good-willed and hardworking. He does well when others fail.
I am the exact opposite.
I didn't inherit a dime. I spent my life as an investor — and I was good at it. When others put their trust in me — I found shared opportunities, and we shared in success. What America needs is someone who knows how to grow prosperity for all: we need a President who will invest in the American people and put their interests, first … every time.
Look, I want to acknowledge that every democratic candidate shares core values … on fairness, equality, access to opportunity, affordable healthcare, and a living wage as a right, and on and on.
Donald Trump, will continue to embrace racism, misogyny, and hate … that much is clear. His biggest and only play — is to point to his so-called economic success — his fake economic success. We, as a party — cannot, and must not — give him that chance.
He's a conman, and I know I am the most qualified to see through his game. I know I can expose him for the fraud that he is. And, in 2020 — I know I can beat him.
People have asked me, time and time again, why I'm running for President. I'm not a governor, or a congressman, or a senator — I'm not a politician.
I'm not running to be something. I am running to do something.
The potential of the American promise is limitless — but only if we can take back our rights and our freedom. The most heroic version of America, is one where the people — and only the people — write the rules and determine our own destiny.
That's why I'm running — to do everything in my power to defend that promise … to unlock that potential … and to finally restore a government that is truly: of, by, and for the people.
Thank you.

Sanders Campaign Press Release - New Hampshire For Bernie Hits Milestone Doors Knocked,2019-12-16T00:00:00+00:00,Bernie Sanders,/documents/sanders-campaign-press-release-new-hampshire-for-bernie-hits-milestone-doors-knocked,"
MANCHESTER, N.H. – New Hampshire for Bernie announced today that the campaign knocked 36,682 doors over the past two weekends. In total, 167,978 doors have been knocked in New Hampshire by staff and volunteers since the launch of the campaign.
""The volunteers in New Hampshire understand that real change comes from the bottom up,"" said Sean Ward, Bernie 2020 New Hampshire Field Director. ""Despite rain, snow and cold weather, our volunteers knocked almost 18,000 doors this weekend alone. This weekend's weather was miserable and these results are a testament to the hard work of our team as well as the dedicated volunteers.""
The accomplishment comes on the heels of a visit to the Granite State from Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ilhan Omar. The visit to New Hampshire focused on the importance of youth engagement, with events for students and young voters, including a rally at Nashua Community College. The rally exceeded 1,300 attendees -- the largest of any candidate in the race -- reflecting the growing grassroots support on the ground in New Hampshire.

Bennet Campaign Memorandum on New Hampshire Investment Strategy,2019-12-16T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-memorandum-new-hampshire-investment-strategy,"
To: SupportersFrom: Daniel Barash, Campaign ManagerRe: New Hampshire Investment StrategyDate: December 16, 2019

As other candidates have left the race or stumbled in the last few weeks, Michael has doubled down and gained momentum. Now is our moment. We have planted our flag in New Hampshire, but we need your help right now to have the resources to compete there.
State of the Race
In less than two months, Democrats begin voting. In New Hampshire, just 33% of Democratic voters say their decision is definite. An unprecedented number of primary voters are undecided or open to changing their mind. In 2004 to the week, in a similarly crowded and talented field trying to defeat an incumbent Republican president, a poll showed Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, Dick Gephardt, Joe Lieberman, and Al Sharpton all ahead of the eventual nominee, John Kerry.
In other words, the Democratic primary race continues to be unsettled and support is far from consolidated. For voters, perceptions of electability are an even more significant vote driver than before. However, no leading candidate inspires real confidence in his or her ability to beat Donald Trump. They have serious flaws that have capped the growth of their support.
Michael is within the margin of error of many candidates who are better known, and, in recent weeks, polls have shown us tied or ahead of candidates who were on the last debate stage.
Our theory of the case since entering the race in May has been that the issue environment, historical precedent of ideological candidates washing out, and demand for a nominee who can beat Trump will crystallize as voting nears. All of this benefits Michael, the only candidate with the political record of winning twice in a swing state and an agenda that can gain broad support to defeat Trump and build a stronger future for the next generation.
Voters are finally tuning into the race, and as Michael has repeatedly said, he's going to be here when they make up their minds.
Our Current Resources
At a time when other campaigns have slashed staff, closed offices, and left the race, we have been able to grow and build in New Hampshire. From more endorsements to larger crowds and new office space, the environment is ripe for our success.
However, we are unable to fully seize these favorable dynamics, particularly because of our slim paid media budget. As a campaign, we have budgeted strategically and judiciously for the long haul—running a smart and scrappy operation—and we have the funds necessary to continue at the current pace. We have made it to the starting line and are prepared to fight in New Hampshire. But without a significant uptick in fundraising, we will not have the resources to fully capitalize on the groundwork that has been laid to compete.
Earlier this month, we launched our 50 town hall strategy in New Hampshire, and we need the resources to effectively promote and build it. Our target audience in New Hampshire—which includes independent voters who participate in Democratic primaries—is generally more difficult and expensive to reach. Without funds for TV and digital advertising, more field staff, and a direct mail program, we cannot compete with the billionaires flooding the airwaves and building on the ground.
We need a realistic chance, not just a fighting one. And for that, we need more resources.
Our New Hampshire Investment Strategy
We have reached a critical point in this campaign, and we are coming to our top supporters with a final ask: Can you help us raise $700,000 for our New Hampshire Investment Strategy by January 16 so we have the resources needed to compete?
With this money, we will make investments to communicate directly with New Hampshire voters through paid media—including digital advertising, direct mail, and TV—as well as expand our organizing and outreach programs. Core to this strategy will be a campaign around a new ad series depicting who Michael is, why he is running, and why he is the best candidate to beat Trump, flip the Senate, and hold the House. The ads will promote our 50 New Hampshire town halls in addition to Michael's values, policies, and vision. Without this investment in a paid television and digital media program, these videos—which were all filmed in New Hampshire—will not be able to reach the voters who are looking for a candidate like Michael, but still don't know enough about him or have not had a chance to meet him.
This is the final push. This is our final ask. If you believe, as we do, that Michael is the best candidate to lead Democrats to victory up and down the ballot in November 2020, then support our New Hampshire Investment Strategy. Your contribution will help us solidify our recent gains and boost Michael to success in the New Hampshire primary and beyond.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Andrew Yang Unveils A New Way Forward For Healthcare in America,2019-12-16T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-andrew-yang-unveils-new-way-forward-for-healthcare-america,"
NEW YORK — Andrew Yang today unveiled a New Way Forward to fix the broken healthcare system in America and ensure that every American receives the healthcare they need.
""We're having the wrong conversation on healthcare. We are spending all our time arguing over who wants to cover Americans more. We talk about how we're going to pay for it, when we already are. What we need to address are the underlying problems driving unaffordability and access. It's ridiculous that the richest and most advanced country in the history of the world has millions of Americans worried about bankruptcy because of medical bills. We owe it to ourselves and our children to get this right and ensure that people are getting the care they need and deserve,"" said Andrew Yang. ""My plan accomplishes that through a holistic approach that includes a focus on preventative care and mental health, while taking the pharmaceutical industry to task on behalf of the American people.""
Solving the root problems plaguing the American healthcare system means controlling the costs of prescription drugs. It means investing in innovative technology to cut waste and boost access. It means changing the incentive structure for providers. It means shifting our focus on more stages of care. It means revamping what comprehensive care means in the 21st century to include crucial aspects of wellbeing. It means taking on the powerful lobbyists in Washington, DC.
Andrew Yang's plan is a statement on the critical failings of our system and the viable paths to solve them. We cannot find the answers to one of the most serious problems in modern American history unless we are asking the right questions. It's time we start asking them.
Andrew Yang's plan to fix our broken healthcare system will tackle the root problems through a six-pronged approach:

Control the cost of life-saving prescription drugs, through negotiating drug prices, using international reference pricing, forced licensing, public manufacturing facilities, and importation.
Invest in technologies to finally make health services function efficiently and reduce waste by utilizing modernized services like telehealth and assistive technology, supported by measures such as multi-state licensing laws.
Change the incentive structure by offering flexibility to providers, prioritizing patients over paperwork, and increasing the supply of practitioners.
Shift our focus and educating ourselves in preventative care and end-of-life care options.
Ensure crucial aspects of wellbeing, including mental health, care for people with disabilities, HIV/AIDs detection and treatment, reproductive health, maternal care, dental, and vision are addressed and integrated into comprehensive care for the 21st century.
Diminish the influence of lobbyists and special interests in the healthcare industry that makes it nearly impossible to draft and pass meaningful healthcare reform.

We need a realistic chance, not just a fighting one. And for that, we need more resources.
Our New Hampshire Investment Strategy
We have reached a critical point in this campaign, and we are coming to our top supporters with a final ask: Can you help us raise $700,000 for our New Hampshire Investment Strategy by January 16 so we have the resources needed to compete?
With this money, we will make investments to communicate directly with New Hampshire voters through paid media—including digital advertising, direct mail, and TV—as well as expand our organizing and outreach programs. Core to this strategy will be a campaign around a new ad series depicting who Michael is, why he is running, and why he is the best candidate to beat Trump, flip the Senate, and hold the House. The ads will promote our 50 New Hampshire town halls in addition to Michael's values, policies, and vision. Without this investment in a paid television and digital media program, these videos—which were all filmed in New Hampshire—will not be able to reach the voters who are looking for a candidate like Michael, but still don't know enough about him or have not had a chance to meet him.
This is the final push. This is our final ask. If you believe, as we do, that Michael is the best candidate to lead Democrats to victory up and down the ballot in November 2020, then support our New Hampshire Investment Strategy. Your contribution will help us solidify our recent gains and boost Michael to success in the New Hampshire primary and beyond.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Andrew Yang Unveils A New Way Forward For Healthcare in America,2019-12-16T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-andrew-yang-unveils-new-way-forward-for-healthcare-america,"
NEW YORK — Andrew Yang today unveiled a New Way Forward to fix the broken healthcare system in America and ensure that every American receives the healthcare they need.
""We're having the wrong conversation on healthcare. We are spending all our time arguing over who wants to cover Americans more. We talk about how we're going to pay for it, when we already are. What we need to address are the underlying problems driving unaffordability and access. It's ridiculous that the richest and most advanced country in the history of the world has millions of Americans worried about bankruptcy because of medical bills. We owe it to ourselves and our children to get this right and ensure that people are getting the care they need and deserve,"" said Andrew Yang. ""My plan accomplishes that through a holistic approach that includes a focus on preventative care and mental health, while taking the pharmaceutical industry to task on behalf of the American people.""
Solving the root problems plaguing the American healthcare system means controlling the costs of prescription drugs. It means investing in innovative technology to cut waste and boost access. It means changing the incentive structure for providers. It means shifting our focus on more stages of care. It means revamping what comprehensive care means in the 21st century to include crucial aspects of wellbeing. It means taking on the powerful lobbyists in Washington, DC.
Andrew Yang's plan is a statement on the critical failings of our system and the viable paths to solve them. We cannot find the answers to one of the most serious problems in modern American history unless we are asking the right questions. It's time we start asking them.
Andrew Yang's plan to fix our broken healthcare system will tackle the root problems through a six-pronged approach:

Control the cost of life-saving prescription drugs, through negotiating drug prices, using international reference pricing, forced licensing, public manufacturing facilities, and importation.
Invest in technologies to finally make health services function efficiently and reduce waste by utilizing modernized services like telehealth and assistive technology, supported by measures such as multi-state licensing laws.
Change the incentive structure by offering flexibility to providers, prioritizing patients over paperwork, and increasing the supply of practitioners.
Shift our focus and educating ourselves in preventative care and end-of-life care options.
Ensure crucial aspects of wellbeing, including mental health, care for people with disabilities, HIV/AIDs detection and treatment, reproductive health, maternal care, dental, and vision are addressed and integrated into comprehensive care for the 21st century.
Diminish the influence of lobbyists and special interests in the healthcare industry that makes it nearly impossible to draft and pass meaningful healthcare reform.

"Remarks on Opening the First State Campaign Office in Charlotte, North Carolina",2019-12-15T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/remarks-opening-the-first-state-campaign-office-charlotte-north-carolina,"
Thank you for that warm welcome, and I also wanted to give special thanks to the mayor who has been stuck shepherding me around this city today. We sat in church and had a phenomenal time. The pastor gave one of the funniest, best sermons I've ever had. She and I couldn't stop giggling the whole time.
It's great to be here with you all here in beautiful Charlotte in the great state of North Carolina. The last time I was here was maybe six months ago. Afterwards we did an event, and I want to thank you all for coming out on Sunday. We promise not to keep you too long – know there's a Panthers game about to kick off. Yeah, well, we have the Giants and the Jets, so no working me over about this.
It's been a great visit so far. But there has been one disappointment: I was really looking forward to going to Price's Chicken Coop. Turns out they're closed on Sundays – who knew. Maybe we'll pick-up some Bojangles before I leave.
It's been great to meet some of the new staff that we've hired, and just quickly, I'd also like to thank a few people here: Smuggie – where'd you get the name Smuggie? James Mitchell, for everything he's done to make us feel at home here. You really are the greatest.
One of our national co-chairs made the trip: Mayor Steve Benjamin. I don't know whether Columbia, South Carolina appreciates what this guy does, but he's got to be one of America's mayor, and he really is just very helpful. And the fact that he comes from the other Carolina we're not going to hold against him.
And Alma Adams, and the chair of the Mecklenburg County Democratic Party, Jane Whitley. I appreciate you coming out.
And incidentally, I wanted to congratulate the mayor on your second term. I've gotten to know your mayor over the years, and she is one of the most dynamic mayors in the country.
Today we had a nice morning, and I put a call in to Harvey Gantt who I wanted to say hello to. We have a number of things in common. He actually designed the church that I just came from, but he also went to school in Boston 20 minutes from where I grew up. And it was another one of those schools that I couldn't get into. And he also is our landlord here.
This is our first state headquarters. All my headquarters campaign stuff was basically in one place in New York City for 12 years – three elections. I will say, I love campaigning, every one of them. And particularly the way they turned out so I was very happy about that. But I've never done anything on the scale of this. And somebody said, 'Why are you running for president?' And I said, well there's a whole bunch of reasons I'll come back to later on, but one of them is I really did like campaigning, I like people. And the people that I really like are those that aren't happy with everything because then you can explain why maybe they should be. Not all of them are convincible, but that's okay.
We are here for the long haul. Other campaigns come in and then they disappear before Super Tuesday. But we're here and we are going to stay here, not just through Super Tuesday, but through the Republican convention when you-know-who comes to town. And we'll be staying through November 3rd, when we defeat you-know-who and turn North Carolina blue.
To make that happen, we need a nominee who can run a campaign that will appeal to Americans across our divides, and that's exactly the kind of campaign that we plan to run.
I am a big believer that the President of the United States' job is not to be a party leader, it's to run the country and represent everybody no matter what their political persuasion is.
Unfortunately, I gave a speech back in must have been about August of 2016 at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia where I said that Hillary Clinton was the one that I was going to vote for, and that Donald Trump is not the right kind of person to be President of the United States. And nothing that he's done or said has changed my mind. We just have to change presidents and we just cannot afford to lose this election. We can't have another four years of Donald Trump with his recklessness and his unethical actions. If he wins another term, it'd be so hard to reverse this. So we actually have to do something about it.
Unfortunately, I think the chances of Donald Trump's reelection have gone up over the last year, and that was one of the things that convinced me to enter the race. Shame on me if I'm not willing to do what I've asked you to do, and that is help us change the president, and the Republicans have just not done what this country needs. And so we need to turn things blue and get us back working together, working on the straight track.
What we have to do is unite each other and rebuild America. And I think this is the beginning of that.
My staff said you should tell people what you have in common with Donald Trump – after all, we both come from New York. And people say how well do you know him? Well, we've cut some ribbons together and we took the subway together and that sort of thing, but we don't have an awful lot in common. He inherited his money – and I didn't. My father made $6,000 the best year of his life. I started my company from scratch.
Donald played a CEO on reality TV – I actually worked as one in real life.
He filed for bankruptcy six times – I guess he finally found something he was good at. My company has grown every year, even during recessions. And unlike Donald Trump, I give away virtually all of my company's profits to support issues that I've devoted my life to. I care about a handful of things, but they are so important, particularly when I look at my kids, and we all have to pull together.
Gun violence is just an outrage in this country. We have to do something about it. Public health, there are too many people that don't get the kind of medical care and don't know what things are hurting themselves, and places where it's dangerous to go.
Education is maybe the number one priority long-term, you just have to have a good education or you're not going to be able to survive in the economy that we're going in to. And climate change, which has the potential to destroy the planet, and we just have to stop saying it's not real and start doing something about it. We all have to get together, and we know what to do, it's just we're not willing to do it or not willing to do it fast enough.
And Donald, also, if you believe what the court said, he cheated his own charity out of money. I don't know how you could do that.
There's one more difference that I wanted to mention: he has no respect for the truth, all kidding aside. He just makes up alternative facts, and he denies science.
I have a saying in my company: in God we trust. Everyone else, bring data. We need a president who isn't afraid to face the facts and speak the truth. And if he would do that he'd be a much better president, but he doesn't seem to be able to do that. That's the only way I think that we're going to be able to solve the problems that this country faces – and we all know what they are.
We have a health care system that costs us too much and doesn't cover everyone – including more than one million people here in North Carolina that are not covered.
We have an immigration system that is cruel and dysfunctional, and everyone here knows that walls won't fix this.
Climate change is growing worse every single day.
We have children being gunned down in our streets by the thousands.
And we have an economy that is tilted against most Americans. We just can't keep going on this way.
The fact is, for example, the minimum wage in North Carolina is still $7.25. I don't know how to break this to anybody, but if you think about it, nobody can feed a family on $7.25, no less buy gifts to put under the tree.
In New York, I'm happy to say, we raised the minimum wage – it's gone up to $15 an hour, which is really much more able to be tolerated, people can continue to earn a living and take care of their families. There's no reason why we can't change that.
I'm a businessperson and I can tell you, the businesspeople can afford it. They'll complain a little bit, but we have to have our employees and our fellow citizens, our customers, everybody, be able to enjoy what America is all about and put food on the table.
I've been very lucky in my life, my family wasn't wealthy, but we always had a roof over our heads and food in our stomachs, and my sister and I were lucky enough to get a good education.
But what we did get from our parents more than anything was we learned to be honest and hardworking, and to respect other people. Those lessons that I learned at the kitchen table have stuck with me.
I worked my way through college and business school, if you were wondering. I did get a job when I got out of school, and then I got laid off when I was 39. I didn't get any job offers – so I started a company. And thank God I did get laid off, it turned out well. We have 20,000 employees around the world, who I think get paid well and treated well. Most of them seem happy. And we have a lot of customers right here in Charlotte. This is a big part of our business, and we have a lot of employees here to cover the banks and write news stories.
Why leave my company and run for mayor back then? I kept listening to people saying, oh the government doesn't work and that's just the way it is. And I couldn't figure out why that should be – why couldn't we have good government? If you can run a company well, you should be able to run the city well. And we made an enormous amount of progress in the 12 years I was lucky to be mayor. I will say that I loved every minute of it, I will say that a majority of the people loved me.
As the Mayor will tell you, you can't please all the people all the time, and everybody wants something and nobody wants to pay for it.
We did cut the murder rate in half in the 12 years that I was mayor, and I think we can do that nationally.
We did cut the incarceration rate by 39 percent in New York – even though it went up in the rest of the country. And I think we can do that again nationally.
We raised graduation rates in New York City by 42 percent – and at the same time one of the keys to that was we raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. And we can do the same thing nationally.
If you want good teachers or cops or firefighters or sanitation workers or clerical staff or whatever, you just have to pay them well. Same thing, it works for them, it works for each of us.
If you want to build affordable housing, a lot of it, we did record amounts. We have a formula for that, and we can certainly do it nationally.
And I might point out when it comes to climate change, we cut New York City's carbon footprint twice as much as the rest of the country, and we can do that again. And we have to do that, or we just don't have a future.
Now I can't tell you we did everything perfectly in New York, or solve every problem. I certainly made mistakes. But when I was first elected mayor, we were recovering from the tragedy of 9/11. And by the time I left office, the city was stronger and safer than it had ever been.
Now, Charlotte, I know, is not New York City – it may be better the Mayor would say. As a loyal citizens of New York I have to say no. It's the second best. I grew up in Boston, and my daughters who were born in New York have never forgiven me, keep saying you're not a real New Yorker, thank you very much.
But I'll be a president who makes, if I get elected, full partners of state and local leaders like Mayor Lyles, and working together we really can, I think, change this country for the better in so many ways.
So just let me tell you quickly what I'm going to do as president – and I emphasize the word 'do' in that because to me, leadership is not about making promises, anybody can make big promises. It's like shouting into the wind, or shaking your fist at the world. What doing is is bringing people together and getting things done.
If you ask me what do I think I do well, it isn't doing these things that I talked about. It is putting the team together that's going to do it. A very smart person once said if you spell out the word 'team' you'll find there's no 'I' in team. And what I'm good at is getting people together and supporting them, and when there are problems helping them get through those problems. But also delegating and giving people authority to go along with responsibility.
So briefly, here are just a couple of things that I'm going to get done as president. I'm going to make sure that every job pays a living wage. I'm going to make sure that every child can attend a top-quality school no matter what zip code they live in. You just can't have education depending on your zip code. In fact, in some zip codes you need more help than in another zip codes, and we don't unfortunately take it the right way.
I'm going to make sure that every family can breathe clean air and that America once again can lead the fight on climate change. You should know that thanks to my foundation, we have closed almost 60 percent of all the coal fired power plants in the country. I think the number is 299 out of 530, and that's reduced carbon footprint in the country already, and we think by 2030 we can get rid of all of the coal fired power plant carbon.
I will certainly focus and make sure every community is better protected against gun violence. Everytown, the Bloomberg Philanthropies gun effort, has had enormous progress. Half the states in the country have background checks now, and that really does cut particularly the suicide rate among young people, but also the murder rate.
I'm going to make sure that everybody that doesn't have health insurance should get it. You know, we don't have to spend an enormous amount of money. The federal numbers are already always big, but we just cannot – we're too compassionate and too wealthy a country to let 30 million people go unable to see a doctor if they have something really wrong.
I think we can do that and an awful lot more, but only if we win on November 3rd, and that means winning North Carolina and other states.
Right now, Donald Trump is campaigning in those swing states – while every other Democratic campaign is focused on other states. But not us.
We're campaigning here and in the states we need to win in November. We're also funding efforts to register voters in those states, and I don't have to tell you we have a serious problem – voter suppression is something that happens all too often in too many places. We just have to make sure that everybody has voting rights that the Constitution meant them to have, here and across the country.
I've never been one to run away from taking on the toughest fights. I look forward to taking on the toughest fights. I've taken on Donald Trump, the climate denier. And we built a coalition of 4,000 cities, states, and businesses that are committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement.
And we've taken on Donald Trump's support for the biggest polluters in the country, and we've closed the dirtiest coal-fired power plants.
I know how to take on Trump and win. We've beaten him before – and we can beat him again. And together, we can send him back to not Mar-a-Lago, but to Mother Russia.
Seriously, let me just close with just one thought. When I was a child and a Boy Scout – I loved the Boy Scouts – I was taught to believe in the promise and potential of America. I've always believed that America is at its best when we work together to find meaningful and lasting solutions to the big challenges that we face.
So I'm tired of a president that divides us for political purposes – by party, by race, by ethnicity, and by religion. The president, as I said at the beginning, is supposed to lead the whole country, and we've just got to stop pulling people apart and start bringing this country together. That's what I'll focus on.
In the months ahead, I'll announce my plans to address all the big issues facing the country. We have a plan for each of these things so you can judge and decide whether you think they'll work. But more than plans, what I like to think I offer is leadership.
I think if you look back at New York City for 12 years and talk to New Yorkers, generally they would say that we all pulled together, I never divided people. It was always we and included everybody. And while everything didn't work, enough worked that we left the city an awful lot better than we found it.
So I'm ready to get working. Mayor, thank you for everything. And Steve, thank you for everything.
Let's go turn North Carolina blue in 2020.

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg Campaign Opens North Carolina Headquarters,2019-12-15T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-campaign-opens-north-carolina-headquarters,"
First Field Office in the Country Located in Charlotte

CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA — Democratic Presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is in Charlotte today to open the North Carolina headquarters for his 2020 campaign. The Charlotte office is Bloomberg's first field office in the country.
North Carolina is a crucial state in the 2020 election and one of the five states where the campaign has committed to registering 500,000 voters from traditionally underrepresented groups.
In keeping with Bloomberg's commitment to defeating President Trump, the former New York City Mayor has pledged his support to keep the office and staff through the 2020 General Election to support the Democratic Party.
""To defeat Donald Trump in November, the Democratic nominee needs to win pivotal swing states like North Carolina – but right now, he's running unopposed in them,"" said Mike Bloomberg. ""We're changing that status quo by taking the fight directly to him and putting down roots in swing states across the country – starting with our first state headquarters in Charlotte.""
""I welcome Mayor Michael Bloomberg to Charlotte as he opens his first state campaign office in the country,"" said Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles. ""I'm happy he chose to focus on North Carolina and specifically the Queen City for such an important milestone in his presidential run, as he's already done so much for our community.""
Bloomberg's North Carolina team will be led by State Director and Charlotte At-Large City Councilman James 'Smuggie' Mitchell.
The headquarters are located in the Uptown neighborhood of Charlotte. Nearly two dozen staffers are focusing on building campaign and field operations across the state of North Carolina, with a staff that will grow appreciably in the coming weeks.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Andrew Yang Announces Plan to Address Care for Children and Adults with Disabilities,2019-12-14T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-andrew-yang-announces-plan-address-care-for-children-and,"
NEW YORK — Andrew Yang today unveiled his plan to address care for children and adults with disabilities. Today, 1 in 4 adults has a disability in the U.S., but 1 in 3 people with a disability do not have access to a primary healthcare provider and has unmet healthcare needs due to high costs. Additionally, 13.3 million children in the U.S. live with special healthcare needs.
""As the father of a son with autism, I understand the hardships millions of other American families face everyday,"" said Andrew Yang. ""Children and adults with disabilities need a wide range of medical and long-term services and support that our current healthcare system does not prioritize, and we need to do better by them."" Early detection, intervention, and on-going support is critical for parents of children with disabilities to understand and meet their child's needs. Our healthcare system should ensure all families have access to necessary experts and resources that equally uplift our children.
People with disabilities are much more likely to experience secondary complications that exacerbate their medical conditions and often need fast access to hospitals and treatment. Under the current system, these people disproportionately lack the access that they need because of high unemployment and homelessness rates, and higher rates of poverty. Additionally, they may face accessibility challenges at healthcare provider locations and in transportation.
We need to ensure that all people, including children and persons with disabilities, have equal access to the healthcare they need. Outside of ensuring Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance at all healthcare providers and covering transportation costs, technologies such as telehealth will provide new and more convenient ways for persons with disabilities to access preventative care in a format of their choice and at an affordable cost.

""In 2012, the Sandy Hook Elementary School community suffered an unthinkable tragedy – and seven years later, the federal government has still not responded, even as more schools and public places have become the sites of shootings. Today we renew our commitment to honoring the victims of Sandy Hook and all Americans who have experienced the devastation of gun violence by fighting to save others from the same fate. Every day that America's kids feel unsafe in their schools and neighborhoods, we're failing them. I've made ending the gun violence epidemic a big part of my life's work. We've made some progress in states around the country – but national change requires national leadership in Washington.""

Booker Campaign Press Release - Cory Booker Unveils Plan To Ensure Educational Opportunity for Every Child and Great Public Schools in Every Community,2019-12-13T00:00:00+00:00,Cory Booker,/documents/booker-campaign-press-release-cory-booker-unveils-plan-ensure-educational-opportunity-for,"
Cory Will Invest $200 Billion in School Infrastructure
Plan Includes Dramatic Investments to Raise Teacher Pay and Increase Teacher Diversity; Educators Serving in High-Poverty Districts Would Receive Raises Up to $15,500
Plan Outlines Vision for Traditional Public Schools and High-performing Public Charter Schools When Local Communities Call for Them
Newark, NJ — Cory Booker knows the impact a good public school education has on a child's life. When Cory was a baby, his parents fought with the help of civil rights activists to move his family into a neighborhood with good public schools, which in the 1960s were very often in all-white neighborhoods.
That story has personally impacted Cory and his commitment to ensuring every single child has access to a high quality public education. As mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Cory ran toward the tough challenge of improving Newark's schools, and the reforms he set in motion produced results: graduation rates have increased nearly 30 percent since 2008, teacher pay went up, and Newark now has more ""beat the odds schools"" — schools in high poverty communities with high academic performance — than any other city in the country. Over the course of his time as mayor, college enrollment among Newarkers increased 37 percent.
Today, ahead of tomorrow's Public Education Forum 2020 in Pittsburgh, Cory is outlining how he is going to make limitless educational opportunity a reality for every American child.
As president, Cory will massively increase the federal investment in low-income schools so that all schools can nurture the genius of our children. And as part of his proposal, Cory will also honor, value, and support teachers and public school professionals by increasing teacher pay, expanding loan forgiveness, and investing in teacher training and recruitment, especially to improve teacher diversity.
""Every parent in America hopes that their child will have the opportunities that come from a great public education. The education I received as a child transformed the trajectory of my life,"" said Cory Booker. ""But to get it, my parents had to fight to move my family into a neighborhood with good public schools. 50 years later, the reality is that access to a high-quality public education still too often depends on the zip code a child lives in and the size of their family's bank account.
""We owe the same opportunity provided by a great public education to every child in our country. This isn't an academic exercise for me, it's personal — as mayor, when I saw Newark's kids in crisis, I ran toward the problem and tried to fix it. As a senator, I've continued to fight for public school students and teachers. And as president of the United States, it will be a priority for me to ensure every child has access to the great education that creates a pathway to a better life.""
He'll make this vision a reality by:

Investing at least $200 billion in school infrastructure to ensure that every school, including in low-income districts and rural areas, are in good condition and able to provide an education that prepares all students for the 21st century workforce.
Giving teachers serving in high-poverty districts a raise of up to $15,000 by passing his RAISE Act alongside his proposal to massively expand and reimagine the Earned Income Tax Credit through his Rise Credit. In some states, first-year teachers could see a raise of nearly 50 percent.
Improving the diversity of our educator workforce, Cory will pass his Diversifying by Investing in Educators and Students to Improve Outcomes For Youth (DIVERSIFY) Act, which would double the award amount for TEACH grants to students who want to become teachers in high-need subjects in high-poverty schools and end yearly automatic budget cuts to the program.
Tripling funding for Title I schools to improve the quality of education for low-income students across the country.
Creating a new grant program seeded with at least $10 billion to incentivize states to reform their school finance systems away from inequitable property tax systems and toward funding systems that ensure an equitable and quality education for every child.
Support high-quality public charter schools as a strategy to help strengthen public school systems and meet the needs of all students.

In the Senate, Cory has fought against the nomination and harmful policies of Betsy DeVos, voted to end high-stakes standardized testing, and has introduced leading bills to help give public school teachers a raise and invest in new teacher recruitment and training initiatives. As president, Cory would nominate a Secretary of Education who has served as a public school teacher, and who understands the critical role that our public schools play in our society.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Andrew Yang Releases Plan to Prioritize Preventative Care and Food Security,2019-12-13T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-andrew-yang-releases-plan-prioritize-preventative-care-and,"
NEW YORK — Today, Andrew Yang released his plan to prioritize preventative care and food security, as critical parts of managing our nation's health. Preventative care and providing education on building healthy habits will help people live longer, healthier lives.
""As a country, we should offer incentives for food banks and clinics to partner together to promote food accessibility and reduce health disparities, and encourage doctors to educate their patients about the importance of diet, nutrition, and physical activity on overall health,"" said Andrew Yang. ""Our focus on healthcare needs to shift from paying for it when we get sick, to educating ourselves in preventative care and ensuring everyone has access to affordable, nutritious food, actions that will make us healthier and reduce costs.""
Patients should have low-cost access to essential preventative care, like physicals and cancer screenings. By focusing on our citizens' health before they get sick, we can reduce the huge costs associated with managing chronic health conditions.
Food security through public health intervention not only ensures Americans have enough food, it has the potential of reducing the development of malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, and other health risks. America is one of the most developed countries in the world, but 41 million Americans face hunger, including nearly 13 million children. Food insecurity disproportionately affects households with children led by single women and people living below the poverty level. This extensive problem has a solution, but it needs the support of the food banks, clinics, and the federal government.
We have to build programs that create partnerships between clinics and food banks to address food security and health. Indianapolis has implemented a program like this in 2017 and continues to serve an average of 135 households in the community. Imagine how many Americans we can promise nutritious food at the table to by implementing this on a larger scale.

"Remarks on Clean Energy in Alexandria, Virginia",2019-12-13T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/remarks-clean-energy-alexandria-virginia,"
Good morning, thank you. It's great to be here with this team of volunteers and climate champions.
Patricia, thank you for those great words. My mother would believe every one of them. My daughters not so much. And you should know that Patricia and I after this is over are going to work to try to get a coach for Reverend Yearwood to learn how to be enthusiastic. Thank you for your comments as well. Your leadership over the years really has made a big difference.
Bruce Nilles is here. He is the brains behind scaling Beyond Coal and really deserves an awful lot of the credit.
We're also joined by Misti O'Quinn – a Sierra Club organizer and mother of three from Dallas, who is taking on the dirtiest coal plant left in the United States.
Deborah Graham – who is a North Carolina activist. I'm going to North Carolina on Sunday, are you going to be there? I'm going to go to church like I do every Sunday. I did for 12 years, I actually went a lot. It's just great to see different cultures and how people pray and people preach and the messages are actually different from each church and you do learn a lot. And I've always joked, but I never told my mother I spent more time in church than temple, but she didn't seem to care when we talked about it.
Duane Ninneman from Minnesota, who is doing great work to pressure rural electric co-ops to ditch coal.
And thank you to all of you.
Eight years ago we were here on a barge in the middle of the Potomac River. It was steaming hot as I remember and we talked about this coal fired power plant and the piles of coal on the upriver side were really amazing. And I always thought, Congress, it's one thing for them to not pay any attention, but they were working down wind. They were breathing all that air. Well today, if you walk out and look at the power plant the coal is all gone, the plant is closed. I assume at some point here it will be ripped down and they'll do something much more productive with the land.
We are in the shadow of the Capitol – and why? Because our national work on climate change began here, and a decade ago we started a program to get a cap and trade bill passed. It was a time when both Houses were in the Democratic hands, but the bill lost in the Senate where they couldn't get 60 votes. And it's a shame because a cap and trade program then had its problems, but I think it would have been the right thing and it would have made a difference. The fact that we didn't get it done is just sad, I guess.
A lot of people thought it was the end of U.S. leadership on climate change back then, but we refused to believe that and I think we've shown that we've done an awful lot since then.
In 2011, we came here, as I said before, and we stood in a spot right around here and we said we are just not going to walk away. And we called our new campaign Beyond Coal, and nearly a decade later it has been called the most successful campaign of the modern environmental movement – thanks to all of you. It just goes to show you if you set reasonable objectives and if you include the public and explain what you're trying to do, we really can make progress. And we are better off because of that, but we're certainly nowhere near where we have to be.
We launched the campaign to retire one-third of the U.S. coal plants by 2020. You'd be happy to know we met that goal six years early – and so we raised it. We met our new goal – and we increased it again.
So far, we have retired 299 out of 530 coal plants across this country. And we have a commitment to retire all of them by 2030. I think given what's happening across the country and the public's understanding of the damage that these plants are doing, not just for long-term climate change but to the short-term environmental issues in the water we drink and the air our kids are breathing, and that sort of thing, this is not an unreasonable goal. And I'm going to do everything I can, and I hope everybody in this room will help to get them all done.
People say why are you so sure you can do it? And my answer is because we've already done.
In the first eight years, we're halfway there. And we accomplished this even with Donald Trump's administration working against us. So if we could have a president that actually wants to lead the way and help, whether they're Democrats or Republicans or whatever, we could do an awful lot more and a lot quicker, and that would save a lot of people's lives and keep them healthier.
That's really why I'm running for President – because I think that Donald Trump is the wrong person for the job. I don't think that he is reuniting and rebuilding America, which is what we needed, still need. I said this back in 2016 at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia. Unfortunately not enough people listened to me, but at least I'm on record. You can get it on YouTube.
We have to start working as hard as we can building a 100 percent clean energy economy because the alternative is just too bad for all of us.
Today, I'm happy to announce that we are setting new, ambitious goals for our country – including goals that we can actually achieve over the next eight years.
First, I will push for an 80 percent reduction in electricity emissions by the year 2028, and 100 percent clean electricity shortly thereafter.
To get it done, we'll replace all U.S. coal plants with clean energy. We'll also replace existing gas plants and we'll stop the construction of new gas plants. There is an article in I think it's today's New York Times about the amount of methane that gas is spewing into the air – it is really scary. This is going to be worse than coal. We've got to make sure that we go from beyond coal to beyond carbon, which is what we've done with our organization.
It's a critical step to stopping the worst effects of climate change, because gas, as I said, is now really a very big problem, bigger than coal.
We'll also put a moratorium on all new fossil-fuel leases on federal lands – that will make a big difference. And we'll end the over $10 billion in subsidies for fossil fuel companies to help them make the transition. But no more tax loopholes, no more tax breaks, or egregious tax deductions. We have to all be in this.
What's happened is an awful lot of coal fired power plants just declare bankruptcy, they walk away from their obligations to help the coal miners who have damage to their lungs from breathing all the air. They walk away from their obligation to honor pension contracts. They walk away from their obligation to reclaim the land afterwards and just say we're bankrupt, sorry. That's what Donald Trump did in his businesses and we just can't allow that anymore.
As president, I will accelerate America's transition to a zero-carbon economy. We have as a goal 2050, but quite honestly we can't wait for 2050, we have to get it done a lot quicker than that. Having said that, you've got to start some place.
And my experience in business and in 12 years in city hall running the most progressive city in the country was if you set big long-term goals nothing ever happens. If you set small, achievable goals, you can do them one after another. And it's just amazing when you stop down the road and look back and see the compound affect that can happen, you can get where you want to go with a lot more degree of assurance and a lot quicker. Long-term goals don't stop people from passing the buck and kicking the can down the road.
So we'll focus on getting big things done now – and improving health and creating jobs for Americans today, and we will cut greenhouse emissions across the entire United States by 2030, and that is a realistic goal. To get 100 percent by 2030 probably not going to happen, but we certainly can get halfway there.
At the same time, we're going to invest in new technology that can move us forward as fast as humanly possible to be a 100 percent clean energy economy that we want. Things are just getting worse by the day, we've just got to stop it.
Just think about this: 18 of the last 19 hottest years in recorded history have taken place since 2001. If you do the math, 19 years, 18 of them in one direction – maybe that's a trend.
Farmers in Canada are growing the same crops that we used to grow in Iowa. I was in Iowa a couple months ago and the farmers I talked to more than anything else they were complaining that they had a new competitor up north. Why? Because Canada is today warmer than it used to be.
In California, everybody I'm sure has seen the newspapers and the television footage of wildfires that are getting more destructive, and the wildfire season in California – I was there yesterday, or the day before – the wildfire season is two months longer than it was a century ago. In Georgia, sea levels are 11 inches higher than in the 1950s. Eleven inches is an awful lot.
So things are going in the wrong direction and we've just got to stop it.
By 2045 or 2050, if not before, the consequences of climate change really can be catastrophic. So we have to set immediate goals I talked about.
The truth is, we don't know what technological advancements will occur in the future, but we can accelerate their development.
I gave a commencement speech at MIT – Massachusetts Institute of Technology – this last spring, and MIT is one of the hotbeds of science in the country, it's a great asset for America. I'm very proud of it because I come from Boston, although I did realize I would have never gotten into MIT if I applied so I didn't apply. But I did live 20 minutes away.
And the message that I tried to give them was that the problem is not science. We have the science or we at least know what science to work on and we will get there. The problem is political. We just have to have the will, and we need leaders to pull us together.
I think we have to quadruple our investment in research and development across multiple federal agencies, to work with the private sector to unlock more private capital for clean energy investment, and work on sustainable development.
And we also have to end the war on science that the Trump Administration is waging.
I believe that all these federal agencies whose mission is to study and protect our environment should be managed by independent scientists. It just cannot be a political thing to decide whether or not you do a study: if I let go of this it falls – the science is there, we know about gravity. You just can't start relitigating and reinvestigating every single thing just to stop any progress or to take us back from where we are today.
I know it's a crazy idea, but when I am president you can rest assured scientists will be allowed to do their jobs.
I promise you I will reverse Trump's dangerous rollbacks of rules that protect clean air and our drinking water and our health and safety. Those rollbacks are exposing millions of Americans to pollution and the people who are most at-risk, actually, are low-income Americans in both urban and rural areas because we put our power plants, unfortunately, in areas where they live.
I'll also bring the full resources of the federal agencies to bear in setting aggressive health and safety standards.
Back when I was mayor – seems like a long time ago, but it wasn't that long ago – I did get a chance to see up-close-and-personal the effects that pollution had on kids and families. The worst air pollution in New York City – and in cities across the country – was in Black and Latino neighborhoods. Those kids in those neighborhoods were much more likely to develop asthma than other children.
There's no question about what happened, you'll see who goes to the hospital with an asthma attack. So we really know where the problem is and we know what's causing it. We're just not doing anything about it, and shame on us. Everybody in this country should have good health regardless of what their zip code is.
I don't want to pick on a former mayor of New York City, but John Lindsay – who was mayor back when I first got to New York in the late '60s – John Lindsay said and everybody loved the statement: I wouldn't breathe any air I couldn't see. Now, it's a cute thing, but it doesn't keep your health good, and it's too cute by half we would say.
Across America, there are communities – both urban and rural – who have suffered for generations from the toxic air and poisonous water and fossil-fuel economy produced for so long while Washington looked the other way.
As president, I promise that I will put all of the hardest-hit communities at the top of our priority list, including those that have provided us with coal for generations.
The coal miners are the ones that suffer more than anybody else. Their health is not great so when we say we're going to move them to areas where the jobs are – a lot of them can't do that, and we've got to understand. Our foundation has tried to work to help train Americans for new jobs across the country. Unfortunately, one of the things that the Trump budget did was it cut back retraining for a lot of these programs.
We have to do something, and today communities face the challenge of diversifying their economies – and making the transition to a 21st-century, low-carbon economy. It isn't easy – far from it.
In the weeks ahead, I'll be speaking with mayors and local leaders from these regions, learning from their experiences, asking for their ideas. Adding the experiences that we had in New York in retraining people. People that came to the country and didn't have a great command of the English language, didn't have the skills that our economy needs, and so we know how to do it. It's much more difficult in some areas of the country than in others, so we've got to pull together and figure out a way to do it.
It's outrageous that the coal companies aren't helping, they just use that bankruptcy out that I talked about. But if you hold everybody accountable – including us – we can make some progress.
The issues I outlined today are only the beginning of our climate change agenda – which will also be part of our overall agenda on jobs, and other health issues. I will be rolling that out over the next few weeks. And more than plans, what I'm going to promise, try to show that I can do it, is offer the leadership to get everybody to pull together and to really make progress rather than just complain. That's what leadership is all about.
In New York, not me but the team that I put together had a record for 12 years of building coalitions and turning plans into reality. That team has never been afraid of the toughest battles against President Trump now, and the biggest special interests – whether it is coal industry, gun lobby, or Big Tobacco. In all of those cases, during our administration in the city and after we left city hall, we've taken on all these issues, and so far we've won. We do know how to fight Donald Trump. We've beat him a number of times.
We took on Donald Trump after he said he would pull us out of the Paris Climate Agreement. We formed a group joint with Jerry Brown, the Governor of California who I was with in San Francisco a couple of days ago, to announce that we've made something called America's Pledge saying we are going to step in and replace the federal government, believe it or not. And we've actually done that.
And I was in Madrid three days ago to give our report to the United Nations, which is what the Paris Agreement required us to do to show that we really are making progress. And there's companies and state governments and city governments and nonprofits, all of whom have gotten together and really made a big difference.
So we've got a lot more work to do – and I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get working. I know you are, too.
I think we should find a way to defeat Donald Trump who keeps trying to drag us backwards. This is not a game. This is not something we should be playing politics with. This is people's lives.

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg Unveils Plan to Slash Emissions by 50% by 2030,2019-12-13T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-unveils-plan-slash-emissions-50-2030,"
Vows as president to immediately stop new construction of gas plants and retire all U.S. coal plants in the next decade
Alexandria, Virginia – Today, on a campaign stop in Northern Virginia, Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg outlined his first of several plans to propel the country towards a 100% clean-energy future as soon as humanly possible, and before 2050, slashing emissions by 50% across the whole U.S. economy in ten years. The plan calls for the phasing out of all carbon and health-threatening pollution in the electricity sector, ensuring 80% clean electricity by the end of his second term of office.
Mike's plan replaces the remaining 251 coal plants in the United States with clean power and immediately stops the rush to build all proposed gas plants. Coal production in the United States is on the decline, thanks in part to the efforts spearheaded by Mike over the past decade, leaving gas as a leading contributor to dangerous emissions that accelerate climate change. The plan also calls for a complete transition from gas to clean energy, beginning with an end to all subsidies for fossil fuels. Under Mike's plan, stringent carbon and health pollutant standards for new gas plants will also be immediately implemented, avoiding construction and then stranding of a new generation of dirty fossil power plants.
In addition to reducing pollution, Mike will prioritize the communities that have suffered most from coal pollution or have been left behind in the transition to clean energy. Mike will ensure corporations are held responsible for the damages they have created, and commitments made to impacted communities are honored. He will put intense focus on federal rulemaking, enforcement, and investments on communities disproportionately impacted by the production and use of coal and gas. He will also restore the dignity, scientific integrity, and effectiveness of the EPA by immediately reversing President Trump's dangerous rollback of clean air and clean water rules, tightening health and carbon-reduction standards, and greatly expanding enforcement. 
""The president refuses to lead on climate change, so the rest of us must. I've been all in on this fight for more than a decade – and having helped close more than half the nation's dirty coal plants, having cut New York City's carbon footprint by 14 percent, having led a coalition of cities, states, and businesses committed to the Paris Agreement, I know that we can win,"" said Mike Bloomberg. ""We've proven that you can transition to clean energy and strengthen the economy at the same time. As president, I'll accelerate our transition to a 100% clean energy economy."" 
Mike has a proven track record in cutting emissions in the power sector. In 2011, Mike helped launch the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, which has since shuttered more than half – 299 to date – of America's coal-fired power plants, and counting. In 2019, he launched Beyond Carbon, the largest-ever coordinated campaign to combat the climate crisis in the United States. Mike Bloomberg's Beyond Carbon is accelerating work underway in nearly every corner of the country, empowering the elected officials and citizens who are leading it, mobilizing voters who support it, and ensuring that America leads the way in upholding the Paris Climate Agreement — and moving beyond it.
When President Trump decided to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, Mike joined Governor Jerry Brown of California to build America's Pledge, a coalition of mayors, governors, business leaders, and others committed to keeping the United States on track to meet the global climate goals. Mike's plan draws on the analysis and findings from this year's America's Pledge report, which Mike presented to the international climate community at COP25 in Madrid earlier this week. The report found that the combination of local, bottom-up leadership by cities, states, and businesses, with aggressive national action after the 2020 election, could reduce U.S. emissions by nearly half of 2005 levels by 2030. 
QUOTES
""The climate crisis is the defining issue of our time, and to protect our children and grandchildren, we have a moral obligation to find solutions,"" said Reverend Lennox Yearwood Jr., national climate change and climate justice leader. ""Mike Bloomberg's leadership on climate has been steadfast, because he understands the impact of climate pollution on our nation's most vulnerable communities. I'm looking forward to him putting these communities at the forefront of policy solutions.""
""There's no presidential candidate who has shown greater leadership in our existential battle against climate change than Mike Bloomberg,"" said San Jose Mayor and California Campaign Co-Chair Sam Liccardo.  ""Mayor Bloomberg's bold goals  for dramatic fossil fuel reductions match his record of achievement in propelling cities nationally toward a clean energy future."" 
""Climate change is the biggest threat of our lifetime and we need the next president to provide federal leadership domestically and internationally,"" said Bruce Nilles, one of the two co-founders of the Beyond Coal Campaign. ""Mike Bloomberg has an unparalleled record bringing together businesses, elected officials, and community groups to tackle the global crisis and his bold and pragmatic plan will tap into this experience and more to reach our full ambition and put the U.S. back in place as a global climate leader."" 
""Indiana is moving away from coal despite Donald Trump's promises to save a dying, polluting, unhealthy industry,"" said Jodi Perras, Indiana's 2019 Climate Activist of the Year. ""But our progress is not fast enough, with some utilities planning to burn coal for another generation and fracked gas for decades beyond that, while they hide the fact that clean energy costs less. We can't afford another four years of dirty and expensive coal. I share Mr. Bloomberg's vision to move rapidly toward a clean energy economy that leaves no one behind.""
""Mayor Bloomberg's long term commitment to address climate change has delivered. His support of community efforts across the country has resulted in the US move away from coal and unprecedented development of clean energy,"" said Heather Cusick, Midwest Community Activist. ""A new era of tenacious, innovative, and hopeful communities are taking on the fossil fuel industry. For the sake of future generations, I am grateful to Mayor Bloomberg."" 
""Mike Bloomberg doesn't just talk the talk when it comes to climate action: his work has successfully shut down nearly 300 coal plants, making a difference in communities across America,"" said Duane Ninneman, Plains Rural Organizer. ""Mike's solutions-based activism matches my rural community's commitment to cleaner water and air. We're grateful for his commitment.""
""The Beyond Coal campaign has been one of the most successful climate action movements in the past decade, helping to shut down hundreds of coal plants and protect the residents of Arkansas from the extreme health risks that come with them,"" said Glen Hooks, a longtime clean energy activist in Arkansas. ""Our success was made possible by the partnership of Mike Bloomberg.""
""We know the solutions that we must take to address the climate crisis, what we need now is the political will to put them into practice,"" said Molly Diggins, longtime environmental advocate from North Carolina. ""Mayor Bloomberg early on identified the imperative of phasing out coal and through his philanthropy and leadership has supported effective and viable solutions.""
""Consistent with his proven approach to cutting emissions, Mike is taking concrete steps to end reliance on coal and gas immediately,"" said Antha Williams, Mike's senior advisor on climate, energy and environment. ""Mike recognizes that climate is too important a problem to assume a single solution. We'll soon see climate action integrated into all his plans, from economic development to agriculture to foreign policy and more.""
""Having worked with Mike Bloomberg for years, I've seen first-hand his steadfast dedication to advancing a low-carbon economy – and this new plan exemplifies his commitment to this issue,"" said Carl Pope, Mike's senior climate advisor and co-author of the New York Times bestselling book, Climate of Hope. ""Unlike the other candidates in the race, Bloomberg's plan is based on his proven track record of providing real, measurable emissions reductions throughout this country — and on the solid experience of cities, states, and businesses which for years have led America's clean energy efforts. As president, the progress would only accelerate.""
""Mike Bloomberg's philanthropic efforts to address climate change have been transformational. He's been a leader on this defining challenge of our time at a global scale. He's also taken a holistic look at the issue. This includes insuring the transition is just and fair for those communities that are suffering the most from mine closure and plant closure, including right here in West Virginia,"" said Brandon Dennison, CEO, Coalfield Development Corporation. ""Coalfield Development has been a partner with Bloomberg Philanthropies on innovative approaches to business development and on-the-job-training so we can diversify coal-based economies and create a more sustainable economy for Appalachia."" 
""Mike has a deep understanding of the scope of the crisis we're facing and has used his strong voice to safeguard our planet and those who call it home,"" said Andy Sharpless, CEO of Oceana. ""His work to combat climate change and protect the world's ocean is delivering not just for coastal communities, but all communities throughout the United States and around the world.""

Senator Klobuchar's Lead in Legislative Endorsements Continues to Grow 
DES MOINES, IA — Iowa State Senator Kevin Kinney and State Representative Sharon Steckman today endorsed Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. Kinney cited Senator Klobuchar's record of supporting rural communities in announcing his support, while Steckman lauded her ability to connect with everyday Americans and bridge the urban-rural divide.
""Amy connects with people on a very personal level and makes them feel seen and heard,"" said State Senator Kevin Kinney. ""Her track record of working across the aisle and prioritizing rural communities is second to none. I believe Amy will be able to uniquely relate to voters across Iowa and the Midwest who have felt overlooked in recent years. I look forward to caucusing for her in February.""
""Amy Klobuchar understands that to win this election with a mandate, the nominee has to be able to reach out to people of all backgrounds,"" said State Representative and Assistant House Minority Leader Sharon Steckman. ""In the years I've known Amy personally, I've watched her succeed in bringing both sides together to pass meaningful legislation that has improved peoples' lives. In recent months I've had the opportunity to campaign with a number of presidential candidates. I believe that Amy has the agenda, vision and determination to make a difference for rural communities like mine in North Iowa as well as urban centers across the country. She'll be a president who speaks to the interests of all Americans.""
Kinney — who represents Washington County as well as portions of Johnson and Keokuk Counties — currently serves as the ranking Democrat on the State Senate's Agriculture Committee. Steckman has represented her North Iowa district since 2009 and was elected as Assistant Minority Leader in 2018.
The new endorsements come just days after Klobuchar completed her 25th visit to Iowa as a presidential candidate and visited her 70th of Iowa's 99 counties. To date, Klobuchar has the support of more current and former Iowa legislators than any other candidate in the race.

Biden leads Democratic presidential field in CHC endorsements
Los Angeles, California — Today, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (CA-56) released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
""As the first Mexican-American woman elected to Congress, I have spent my life breaking glass ceilings and challenging the status quo in order to serve both my district and my nation. From co-authoring The DREAM Act to my Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, I know that real progress comes as a result of bold and challenging change. A Biden Presidency would represent a sea of change from the current status quo.
""I have served at the forefront of the fight to improve access to quality affordable health care, investing in education, and keeping our country and democracy safe against all threats; Joe Biden has proudly joined me in that fight as Senator and Vice President, advocating for Dreamers and comprehensive immigration reform, and passing Obamacare. Our current president has done everything he can to undo the progress this country has made. This country needs an advocate for the people in the Oval Office who serves with compassion, as opposed to an advocate for just the top 1%. I know Joe Biden will be an ally in this fight and that's why I proudly endorse him for President.""
Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard is the 23rd Member of Congress, the fourth member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and notably the first Latina member of Congress to endorse Joe Biden for President. Congresswoman Roybal-Allard has always been a trailblazer for the community— serving as the first Mexican-American woman elected to Congress, the first Latina to serve on the House Appropriations Committee and to chair one of its subcommittees, and the first woman to chair the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. She is also the founder of the Women's Working Group on Immigration Reform.
Congresswoman Roybal-Allard joins the list of high profile endorsers that Joe Biden has previously earned in California, including Senator Diane Feinstein, Congressman Lou Correa, and Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis. Moreover, this endorsement speaks to Joe Biden's success with building the broadest, most diverse coalition.

""After years of Donald Trump in the White House, it's critical to have a president our children can look up to again — and that's Joe Biden,"" said Dr. Tammy Wawro of Cedar Rapids, a current teacher and former President of the Iowa State Education Association. ""Joe has a demonstrated ability to unite our country and bring civility back into the national discourse. As the spouse of an educator, Joe will treat teachers with the dignity they deserve and he'll nominate a Secretary of Education who has experience in the classroom. In this race, there's no better champion for teachers and students than Joe — and I'll be proud to be in his corner on caucus night.""
""Instantly, Tammy and I bonded over work and our students – teaching is who we are, not what we do,"" said Dr. Jill Biden. ""We can't afford four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos. Joe and I are thrilled to have Tammy on Team Biden and we are so grateful for her support in the Iowa Caucus.""
Dr. Jill Biden is a lifelong educator and professor at Northern Virginia Community College. She continued teaching throughout her eight years as Second Lady. Earlier this year, Vice President Biden proposed a robust plan for education beyond high school — including debt-free community college, public service loan forgiveness, expanded Pell Grants, $50 billion for workforce training, and much more. Biden for President also announced more than 50 Iowa ""Educators for Biden"" supporting the campaign.

Four-term Mayor Highlights Booker's Strong Record as Mayor of Newark and Commitment to Local Government
Columbia, SC — Mayor Terence Roberts of Anderson, SC, today endorsed Cory Booker for president. Roberts, who has been mayor since 2006, highlighted Booker's strong record as the former mayor of Newark, NJ and his commitment to supporting strong Democratic leaders in local government.
""The experience Cory brings to the table — from his years of work helping the people of New Jersey's largest city as mayor to his relentless drive to improve the lives of all Americans as senator — make him the strongest candidate in this race,"" said Mayor Terence Roberts. ""As a mayor of one of South Carolina's growing cities, I know the importance of having someone with mayoral experience as our Commander-in-Chief. The battles we fight on a local level, the challenges mayors take on every day, give us an understanding of the needs of our communities that other elected officials don't often have. As president, Cory will help grow our Democratic Party, work to invest in cities like Anderson, and help local leaders tackle issues we are facing on the ground here in South Carolina. I'm proud to endorse him in this race and urge others to join him in this fight.""
Roberts was first elected mayor in 2006 and has since served four consecutive terms as the mayor of Anderson. Under Roberts' leadership, Anderson has grown and expanded, as more businesses — local and national — have invested in its growing community.
In addition to Roberts, Booker has 43 other endorsements across South Carolina, including fellow Mayors Terrence Culbreath of Johnston; Gregrey Ginyard of Jenkinsville; Samuel E. Murray of Port Royal; Julie Nelson of Manning; and Harold Thompson of Union.
Booker has spent more time in the Palmetto State than any other current presidential candidate; visiting the state 14 times and holding nearly 60 public events in the state. Mary Geren, an Anderson resident and former congressional candidate, joined the Booker campaign as a regional organizing director in March. Last month, Booker's South Carolina campaign announced that more than a hundred women community leaders have endorsed Booker as part of their ""Women for Cory"" rollout.

List of Granite State mayors includes current mayors of Keene, Berlin
Manchester, New Hampshire — Today, Biden for New Hampshire announced six current and former Granite State mayors, representing all four corners of the state, have endorsed Joe Biden for President. Eight New Hampshire mayors have now endorsed Biden, more than any other candidate. Mayors Buckley and Boc had previously endorsed Kamala Harris.
""At a time of extreme polarization, we need a leader with the experience and the tenacity to get things done and to unite our country. Joe Biden is the only candidate I trust to move our country forward and put us back on a path toward getting things done again."" —Kendall Lane, Mayor of Keene
""I support Joe Biden because he is the candidate who can bring people together. Throughout the course of his entire life as a public servant, Joe has always supported the issues that mean the most to average working families in our country. He can beat Donald Trump. And I trust him to always have the best interests of my constituents at heart."" —Paul Grenier, Mayor of Berlin
""As a former Mayor, City Councilor, and Superintendent of Schools with over 40 years of experience in public service, I have seen firsthand how important it is to know how to get things done. There is no candidate that is more qualified and knowledgeable to step into the Oval Office on day one than Vice President Joe Biden. I trust Joe to get our country back on track so my neighbors in Portsmouth can live in a country they can be proud of again."" —Bob Lister, Former Mayor of Portsmouth
""I wake up every morning and think about our children. They don't remember a time when their President set a good example for our nation or when they could aspire to be the same type of leader. Vice President Joe Biden is not only the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, but he will be a leader that our children, and our country, can admire again."" —TJ Jean, Former Mayor of Rochester
""What this country needs right now is a healer. Without any doubt, I know that's Joe Biden. I've seen it here in New Hampshire myself: Vice President Biden is able to connect with people in a way that so few leaders can. On Day One, he'll be able to begin the work of healing this divided nation and moving us past the last four years of corruption and disorder. On Day One, he'll be ready to be a President for all Americans."" —Jack Buckley, Former Mayor of Dover
""After four years of Donald Trump, we need a President who has experience and empathy — and Joe Biden has both in spades. Joe will be able to step into the Oval Office and lead as Commander-in-Chief on Day One, without any on-the-job training, and he'll be able to restore our damaged standing on the world stage. But perhaps more importantly, Joe will govern from a place of humanity — bringing us toward an America that's fairer and more inclusive."" —William Boc, Former Mayor of Dover
These mayors join Dana Hilliard, Mayor of Somersworth and the first openly LGBTQ mayor in New Hampshire, and Bob Baines, former Mayor of Manchester, in supporting Joe Biden for President. These eight mayors join a wide and diverse coalition of Granite State leaders who have previously announced their support for Vice President Biden, including former New Hampshire State Senators Bette Lasky and Deb Reynolds; State Senator Lou D'Allesandro and New Hampshire's youngest state lawmaker, State Representative Denny Ruprecht; former Nigerian refugee, State Representative Richard Komi and substance misuse treatment advocate Olivia Dupell; the first openly LGBT Mayor Dana Hilliard and progressive Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter; former NHDP Chairs Ned Helms, Michael King, and Chris Spirou, and Dean of the NH House Rep.

""Warren shows a real feeling for places left behind because she comes from there,"" the newspaper wrote in an editorial today. ""Elizabeth Warren is fighting on principle like nobody else to give us a chance.""
The Times called Warren's plans to invest in rural America and to create a new farm economy ""the most extensive agenda for rural America built around regenerative agriculture, open and transparent markets, restoring labor rights and reversing the hegemony on the working class in place for the last 50 years.""
Art Cullen, the editor of the Storm Lake Times, is known as ""the voice of rural Iowa"" for his outspoken coverage of issues facing rural communities. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for his powerful editorials challenging corporate agricultural interests in Iowa. Cullen is a contributor to the Washington Post and The Guardian and regularly appears on national news programs to discuss rural issues.
""We need bold, structural change. Going back to the good old days is impossible, and it's not good enough,"" the Times wrote.

And she knows what is right.""

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg Unveils New Housing and Earned Income Tax Credit Proposals in California,2019-12-11T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-unveils-new-housing-and-earned-income-tax,"
Proposals Address Housing Affordability and Initiatives to Raise Low-Wage Incomes
Stockton, California—Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg traveled to California today to unveil two new proposals designed to help address affordability and create economic opportunity for all Americans. The proposals, which were released following a roundtable discussion in Stockton, CA hosted by Mayor Michael Tubbs, and featuring Stockton community members, builds on Mike's record as Mayor of New York City, where he pioneered programs that helped more New Yorkers gain access to housing and economic security.
Mike's housing proposals address the nation's severe shortage of affordable housing, including an expansion of funding for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) that would add hundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing over ten years. The proposal also calls for an increase in federal spending on programs like Public Housing Capital Fund, the HOME program, Community Development Block Grants. In addition, the proposal sets aside $10 billion for a competition to reward municipalities that offer the best solutions to restrictive zoning and other obstacles, as well as increasing funding for federal housing vouchers and reforming them.
Mike's proposals to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) focus on the need for effective programs to raise the incomes of low-wage workers, encourage economic participation, share the gains of growth more broadly, and do as much as possible to end poverty. The proposals call for reforming the EITC to make it much more generous, especially for single childless workers, as well as simplifying the rules so that the credit is easier to administer. He also proposed a pilot program to expand the EITC benefit to cover family caregiving and other forms of unpaid or ineligible employment, with the goal of making this an integral part of his EITC reform.
The proposal will also increase the Child Tax Credit to make it fully refundable, and phase it in faster, starting with the first dollar of earnings. The Child Tax Credit currently works alongside the EITC and raises the incomes of almost all working families, but it does too little for the poorest households.
Mike further calls for the minimum wage to be raised to $15 an hour by 2025 and then to be indexed to growth in median earnings.
""I'm running for president to reunite and rebuild our country — because too many Americans are struggling just to get by, and they've been ignored by Washington for too long,"" said Mike Bloomberg. ""The proposals we announced today reflect my determination to wage war on poverty — a more innovative and effective war, not business-as-usual, and one that engages trailblazing local leaders like Mayor Tubbs.""
""I hate poverty, and am excited to have worked with Mike Bloomberg on this proposal that helps to rebuild the middle class and extends the definition of work to those serving as caregivers who are not usually compensated"" said Mayor Michael Tubbs. ""Furthermore, homelessness and housing are two of the top issues facing our cities nationwide and the proposal shared today by Mayor Bloomberg, demonstrates he has the commitment, the experience and the know how to tackle our most pressing problems.""
""The EITC is a critical lifeline for millions of working Americans whose hard earned paychecks aren't enough to pay the bills,"" said José Cisneros, San Francisco Treasurer, and co-chair of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Coalition. ""I've worked with Mike for more than a dozen years on Financial Empowerment issues. As Mayor, Mike Bloomberg used the Earned Income Tax Credit to catapult the financial standing of low-income New Yorkers. These proposals to strengthen the EITC and Child Tax Credit reflect both his deep understanding and ability to champion needed reform to benefit families across the country.""
""As mayor, Mike Bloomberg made sure we had the resources and leadership to drive the nation's most ambitious affordable housing plan forward, one that created and preserved 165,000 affordable homes for more than half a million hardworking New Yorkers. As president, he will ensure we reverse the hostile policies of the Trump Administration, and will restore funding to programs that help create safe, affordable homes for low-income families, senior citizens, veterans, and the homeless. Mike understands that everybody deserves a place they're proud to call home, and as president I know he'll work tirelessly to ensure we're creating a more equitable, affordable and compassionate America,"" said Rafael E. Cestero, former commissioner of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

Yang Campaign Press Release - Andrew Yang Announces Plans to Expand Mental Health Coverage and Invest in Telehealth,2019-12-11T00:00:00+00:00,Andrew Yang,/documents/yang-campaign-press-release-andrew-yang-announces-plans-expand-mental-health-coverage-and,"
NEW YORK — Andrew Yang today announced his plans to expand mental health coverage and increase the use of telehealth to improve the wellbeing of all Americans. Mental health is an important component of people's overall health, and utilizing telehealth will enhance quality of life and reduce hospital visits, while curbing deaths from chronic diseases.
""Comprehensive care in the 21st century means including crucial aspects of wellbeing and we should be integrating regular mental health checkups into primary care,"" said Andrew Yang. ""Telehealth is an especially effective approach in rural areas and for mental health services, and it will allow licensed physicians to administer medical services and medication with ease and increase accessibility for patients.""
Mental health should be treated more seriously by our healthcare system. There is a mental health crisis in America with 1 in 5 adults experiencing mental illness annually. Our life expectancy is declining due in part to increasing rates of suicide, especially among American youth. The teen suicide rate has gone up 56% from 2007 to 2017, and it is the second leading cause of death for Americans between the ages 10 and 34. 7.7 million youth aged 6-17 experience a mental health disorder each year, but only half receive treatment.
Our veterans, too, do not receive the necessary mental health treatment they need when they come home. 22 veterans commit suicide every day since many don't seek treatment. We need to destigmatize veteran treatment and support their stability to ensure a successful transition to civilian life.
Additionally, the demand for physicians is outpacing the available supply, and the shortage is causing problems for the nation's growing and aging population. Telehealth is an effective approach for doctors across the country to provide care for patients in rural and underserved areas over the internet without needing a specific redundant license to practice medicine in the patient's state. To facilitate telehealth, we must streamline the licensing system and introduce a single, comprehensive telemedicine license that, once granted, will allow care providers to see patients in all 50 states.

""I am honored to endorse and support Secretary Julián Castro for president. He is the most qualified candidate with people-focused solutions that will improve the lives of all Americans. He will elevate the voices of many that have been marginalized and will continue to be an inspiration. I stand with Julián Castro.""
New Mexico State Representative Moe Maestas:
""Our beloved country needs a president like Secretary Castro now more than ever. As a former mayor of one of the nation's largest cities who also has federal executive experience, Secretary Julián Castro is the best candidate to lead our party into next year's general election. Whether it is rebuilding our nation's infrastructure for sustained economic growth, reinstituting sound foreign policy or healing our nation from inhumane immigration policies, Secretary Castro stands out from the rest of the Democratic field. I am proud to endorse his candidacy.""
Lynwood Mayor Aide Castro:
""I endorsed Julián Castro because he gives me hope. He is not concerned with the dog and pony politics that have only continued to oppress lower socioeconomic communities. He is unapologetically ready to roll up his sleeves and do the real work that needs to be done.""
Brian Garcia, Vice President of the Tempe Union High School District Governing Board:
""Secretary Castro embodies the American Dream and fights every day so all of us have a fighting chance to succeed. His vision for America is bold and necessary. We need to ensure our students and families have what they need to thrive, but we face rising challenges. Secretary Castro understands what it takes for working families to survive. No one should live in poverty or constant hunger. We need economic opportunities, health care, funded public education, LGBTQ rights, and protections for Native communities. We need Julián Castro.""
Alfonso Morales, Lynwood Unified School Board Member:
""Julián Castro is the only candidate talking and presenting ideas on issues like homelessness, corporations not paying taxes, health care, racial inequalities, immigration and human rights, which deserve a platform and a plan from candidates. Julián Castro is not afraid to take a position and I'm not afraid to stand with him.""
Layla Avila, Former South Whittier School Board Member and Professor Emeritus at East Los Angeles College:
""Secretary Castro consistently elevates the voices and issues of people of color as well as those living in poverty. He understands the connection between education and other social policies, like housing and immigration. I believe he will work to bring nuanced solutions that focus on helping everyday people.""
Maria Elena Yepes, Former Member of the Los Angeles County Board of Education:
""Secretary Castro will be a president for all of us. He is speaking on the issues that other candidates have not addressed: poverty, homelessness, prison reform, the incarceration of immigrants, and the discrimination against LGBTQ and transgender Americans. He has specific policy solutions to address those issues, and I look forward to seeing him implement these policies as President of the United States.""
Durham Councilmember Charlie Reece:
""From housing to policing to immigration to a host of other issues, I have been deeply impressed with Secretary Castro's truly progressive policy platform. And just as important has been the way in which Secretary Castro has consistently sought to center issues critical to our nation's most marginalized communities during the course of his campaign.""
Hip Hop Artist and Activist Maya Jupiter:
""I believe in Secretary Julián Castro because he has a strong moral character, is a fearless leader and displays compassion. On the issue of immigration, he sees our shared humanity. He also addresses the root of the problem and understands that people deserve dignity. He has spoken out against police brutality and will fight for accountability and a more just criminal justice system. He will take action against climate change, will fight for women's reproductive rights and stronger gun laws. Secretary Julián Castro is the future. He is us. And I trust him to lead our country into the future making it a better, more just place for all.""
Racial and Social Justice Organizer Jordan Thompson:
""As a racial justice organizer and queer person of color, I believe that Julián Castro is the only presidential candidate with an inclusive agenda that speaks directly to my communities.""

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg Unveils New Housing and Earned Income Tax Credit Proposals in California,2019-12-11T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-unveils-new-housing-and-earned-income-tax,"
Proposals Address Housing Affordability and Initiatives to Raise Low-Wage Incomes
Stockton, California—Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg traveled to California today to unveil two new proposals designed to help address affordability and create economic opportunity for all Americans. The proposals, which were released following a roundtable discussion in Stockton, CA hosted by Mayor Michael Tubbs, and featuring Stockton community members, builds on Mike's record as Mayor of New York City, where he pioneered programs that helped more New Yorkers gain access to housing and economic security.
Mike's housing proposals address the nation's severe shortage of affordable housing, including an expansion of funding for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) that would add hundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing over ten years. The proposal also calls for an increase in federal spending on programs like Public Housing Capital Fund, the HOME program, Community Development Block Grants. In addition, the proposal sets aside $10 billion for a competition to reward municipalities that offer the best solutions to restrictive zoning and other obstacles, as well as increasing funding for federal housing vouchers and reforming them.
Mike's proposals to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) focus on the need for effective programs to raise the incomes of low-wage workers, encourage economic participation, share the gains of growth more broadly, and do as much as possible to end poverty. The proposals call for reforming the EITC to make it much more generous, especially for single childless workers, as well as simplifying the rules so that the credit is easier to administer. He also proposed a pilot program to expand the EITC benefit to cover family caregiving and other forms of unpaid or ineligible employment, with the goal of making this an integral part of his EITC reform.
The proposal will also increase the Child Tax Credit to make it fully refundable, and phase it in faster, starting with the first dollar of earnings. The Child Tax Credit currently works alongside the EITC and raises the incomes of almost all working families, but it does too little for the poorest households.
Mike further calls for the minimum wage to be raised to $15 an hour by 2025 and then to be indexed to growth in median earnings.
""I'm running for president to reunite and rebuild our country — because too many Americans are struggling just to get by, and they've been ignored by Washington for too long,"" said Mike Bloomberg. ""The proposals we announced today reflect my determination to wage war on poverty — a more innovative and effective war, not business-as-usual, and one that engages trailblazing local leaders like Mayor Tubbs.""
""I hate poverty, and am excited to have worked with Mike Bloomberg on this proposal that helps to rebuild the middle class and extends the definition of work to those serving as caregivers who are not usually compensated"" said Mayor Michael Tubbs. ""Furthermore, homelessness and housing are two of the top issues facing our cities nationwide and the proposal shared today by Mayor Bloomberg, demonstrates he has the commitment, the experience and the know how to tackle our most pressing problems.""
""The EITC is a critical lifeline for millions of working Americans whose hard earned paychecks aren't enough to pay the bills,"" said José Cisneros, San Francisco Treasurer, and co-chair of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Coalition. ""I've worked with Mike for more than a dozen years on Financial Empowerment issues. As Mayor, Mike Bloomberg used the Earned Income Tax Credit to catapult the financial standing of low-income New Yorkers. These proposals to strengthen the EITC and Child Tax Credit reflect both his deep understanding and ability to champion needed reform to benefit families across the country.""
""As mayor, Mike Bloomberg made sure we had the resources and leadership to drive the nation's most ambitious affordable housing plan forward, one that created and preserved 165,000 affordable homes for more than half a million hardworking New Yorkers. As president, he will ensure we reverse the hostile policies of the Trump Administration, and will restore funding to programs that help create safe, affordable homes for low-income families, senior citizens, veterans, and the homeless. Mike understands that everybody deserves a place they're proud to call home, and as president I know he'll work tirelessly to ensure we're creating a more equitable, affordable and compassionate America,"" said Rafael E. Cestero, former commissioner of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA —  Stockton, California Mayor Michael Tubbs announced his support of Democratic Presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg today, praising Mike's work with cities and his track record on tackling challenges including gun violence, education and climate change. Mayor Tubbs was also named a national co-chair, the latest to join the Bloomberg campaign. Mayor Tubbs will advise the Bloomberg campaign on strategy, policy, messaging and serve as a surrogate.
""I am excited to endorse Mayor Bloomberg for President as he has the record, the relationships, and the resources to defeat Donald Trump and reclaim our democracy,"" said Mayor Michael Tubbs. ""Today's announcements around affordable housing and extending the Earned Income Tax Credit point to Bloomberg's commitment to eradicating poverty and rebuilding the middle class so that every child in America has the same opportunities he had.""
""As national co-chair, Mayor Tubbs will help us better engage communities like Stockton, all over the country,"" said Kevin Sheekey, Campaign Manager for Mike 2020. ""California is a critical state and we're excited to have the support of one of its most innovative leaders. We're honored to have Mayor Tubbs on our team and to have his perspective as we build out an inclusive campaign.""
Mayor Tubbs hosted Bloomberg in Stockton today for events including a roundtable discussion on housing and economic opportunity, meetings with local entrepreneurs, and a tour of the city's public art installations. While in Stockton, Bloomberg learned more about Mayor Tubbs' efforts to leverage research, sustainable investment and community engagement to address long-standing inequities in the city.
Mayor Tubbs, who was elected in 2016, has prioritized issues including poverty reduction, public safety, workforce development, and education in his first term. When he was first elected, he became the nation's youngest mayor and Stockton's first African-American mayor. Tubbs' leadership and ambitious progressive agenda has received national recognition. Since taking office, Stockton has been named an ""All-America City"" twice, the second most fiscally healthy city in the state, and has seen a 40 percent reduction in homicides. Additionally, Mayor Tubbs created ""Stockton Scholars,"" which provides guaranteed scholarships to Stockton students to attend community college, trade school, or a 4-year University.
Before becoming Mayor, Michael Tubbs served as Stockton's District 6 City Councilmember. Tubbs has been a college course instructor for Aspire Public Schools and a Fellow at the Stanford Institute of Design and the Emerson Collective. Mayor Tubbs graduated in 2012 from Stanford University with a Bachelor's and Master's degree with honors.

Steyer Campaign Press Release - Tom Steyer Announces 10-Year Plan to Revitalize HBCUs in South Carolina and Across the Country,2019-12-10T00:00:00+00:00,Tom Steyer,/documents/steyer-campaign-press-release-tom-steyer-announces-10-year-plan-revitalize-hbcus-south,"
Steyer discusses HBCU 2030 plan with State Representative Jerry Govan and Allen University students 
(COLUMBIA, SC, December 10, 2019) –– Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer announced his HBCU 2030 plan to revitalize our nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Steyer unveiled his plan at Allen University, an HBCU in Columbia, South Carolina. In conversation with Representative Jerry Govan and Allen University students, Steyer discussed the need to invigorate the next generation of leaders, pioneer new research, and continue the proud academic legacy of HBCUs in our nation.
""For as long as they've existed, HBCUs have been underfunded and left to do more with less—all while producing some of the world's most brilliant leaders. My HBCU 2030 plan will address these financial hardships, expand economic opportunities, and ensure that our nation's African American students have the ability to succeed and lead from out front,"" said Steyer.
Steyer's 4-part plan will invest $125 billion in federal resources over 10 years to enhance the White House Initiative on HBCUs and strengthen Centers of Innovation across HBCU campuses, establish a Board of Regents for long-term governance, and foster community impact partnerships across public and private sectors.
South Carolina State Rep. Jerry Govan, an HBCU graduate and senior advisor to the Steyer campaign, also spoke of the plan:
""As a proud HBCU graduate, I know that my time at South Carolina State University gave me a sense of community that I have carried with me throughout my life and career in politics. HBCUs forge pathways of opportunity for young black Americans across the country; we need a president who invests in HBCUs, so that they are around and thriving for this generation and the next. Tom is that person.""
HBCUs have seen massive cuts in federal funding because far too often, their financial resources are at the whims of politicians. To begin leveling the playing field, Steyer's unprecedented $125 billion investment will improve infrastructure, services and facilities for educators, administrators, and students, as well as provide technical assistance to help schools build their endowments.
Steyer's 10-year plan will bolster the White House initiative on HBCUs. Within 180 days, the White House Initiative on HBCUs will develop a stronger HBCU governing structure that allows for more independent decision-making without putting federal assistance at risk. To help foster a stronger, long-lasting connection between HBCUs and their communities, Steyer will establish a Board of Regents to oversee governance across the diverse HBCU system, allow for more governing independence, coordinate state and federal resources, and ensure HBCUs thrive for future generations.
In addition to funding, Steyer's plan recognizes that training the next generation of academics, entrepreneurs, and innovators means committing to research and development on HBCU campuses. That is why Steyer will invest in strengthening and replicating HBCU centers of innovation to spur entrepreneurship, and develop research and development opportunities in STEM fields, healthcare, business, civic engagement, criminal justice, environmental protection, and more.
Crucially, HBCUs are engines that spur economic growth and foster communities within their regions. To continue growing opportunity in HBCU communities, Steyer's plan will assist schools in forging strategic partnerships with community organizations, foundations, nonprofits, and other federal, state and local agencies.
Steyer's HBCU 2030 Plan recognizes that when we empower our nation's young people, their prosperity builds communities –– now and for the future.

Statement by Elizabeth Warren - We Need a Blue New Deal for Our Oceans,2019-12-10T00:00:00+00:00,Elizabeth Warren,/documents/statement-elizabeth-warren-we-need-blue-new-deal-for-our-oceans,"
By Elizabeth Warren
In September, I attended a CNN town hall on the climate crisis. That night, Bren Smith, an ocean farmer from Connecticut, asked me if I would support a Blue New Deal to restore our oceans, in addition to our efforts to fight climate change on land. I said I would, and I meant it — here's what I'll do to rebuild our blue economy, protect and restore ocean habitat, and adapt in a climate changed world.
The world's oceans are in crisis. Across the planet, more than 90% of global fish stocks are fully exploited or overfished. The ocean has absorbed 93% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, warming the waters disrupting migration patterns, bleaching coral reefs, and fueling sea level rise.  of the carbon pollution we have pumped into the air has been absorbed in our oceans, leading to ocean acidification, changing the very chemistry of seawater. And pollution from land — whether from manufacturing, agricultural runoff, or plastic waste — is causing dead zones in our waterways and Great Lakes.
Our coasts are flooding and eroding, threatening the 40% of Americans who live in coastal counties. Our safety, public health, food security, and infrastructure are at risk. If we do not act now, things will only get worse, as climate change leads to more severe weather.
I am proud to be one of the original co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, which charts a path to transition to a 100% clean energy future, while rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and creating millions of good paying, union jobs. Environmental justice and economic justice go hand-in-hand, and I am committed to making the climate crisis and the inequality crisis top priorities in my administration.
As we pursue climate justice, we must not lose sight of the 71% of our planet covered by the ocean. While the ocean is severely threatened, it can also be a major part of the climate solution — from providing new sources of clean energy to supporting a new future of ocean farming. That is why I believe that a Blue New Deal must be an essential part of any Green New Deal — helping us fight climate change, protecting our health, and creating good, high-wage union jobs in the process.
Rebuilding our Blue Economy
Oceans already support millions of jobs, underpin our food system and contributes $304 billion to our national GDP. They also have the potential to be one of our strongest tools in the fight against climate change. Three billion people around the world depend on wild-caught and farmed seafood as a major source of protein. Yet decades of overfishing, pollution, and climate impacts have pushed our oceans to the brink of collapse. We know that we can have a highly productive ocean. In fact, ocean-related jobs have grown at three times the rate of the national average. It's time to restore our oceans and harness the potential of the Blue Economy.
Expand offshore renewable energy
As we rapidly transition our economy to 100% clean energy, we must prioritize offshore wind and wave energy. Offshore wind is more consistent than onshore wind and could provide four times the present capacity of our grid. By 2030, offshore wind energy development from Maryland to Maine could support more than 36,000 full time jobs. But the Trump administration and government red tape have bogged down existing projects, making development cumbersome and untenable. Despite a decade of effort, the Block Island Offshore Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island remains the only offshore wind project operating in the United States.
This will change in a Warren administration. As president, I will work to streamline and fast-track permitting for offshore renewable energy, including making sure projects are sited with care based on environmental impact assessments. And I will make sure that the communities hosting this new development receive a share of the benefits. Community Benefit Agreements can help address power imbalances between project developers and low-income communities by setting labor, environmental, and transparency standards before work begins. I'll make additional federal subsidies or tax benefits for large offshore renewable energy projects contingent on strong Community Benefits Agreements, which should include requirements for prevailing wages and collective bargaining rights. And I'll insist on a clawback provision if a company doesn't hold up its end of the deal. If developers work with communities to ensure that everyone benefits from clean energy development, we will be able to reduce our emissions faster. Due to the urgency and complexity of building offshore renewable energy projects, my administration will seek to execute Project Labor Agreements to govern the construction and maintenance of these projects so as to ensure a constant supply of qualified, trained workers — and creating good, union jobs in the process.
My Green Manufacturing plan also calls for a $2 trillion investment to incentivize American-made clean energy, and that includes offshore wind. My administration will work to ensure that all offshore wind infrastructure is made with a completely domestic supply chain, including American iron, steel and cement and that American crews on American vessels will be used to ferry the goods and workers to build and maintain these farms, creating more new American jobs. And I will make sure that fishing and conservation groups, as well as coastal communities, have a seat at the table in developing any new project to ensure that an expanded offshore wind industry can successfully coexist with vibrant fishing industries and healthy ocean and coastal habitats. And I won't allow visual and aesthetic impacts to provide a basis for denying federal offshore wind energy permits. The climate crisis is too urgent to let the ultra-wealthy complain about wind turbines getting in the way of their ocean views.
Additionally, my Green Apollo Program commits $400 billion over the next decade to R&D for clean energy, including harnessing power from wave energy, so that it becomes technologically and financially viable. I will also fight for long term extensions to two critical tax credits for renewable energy, the Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit, while also fighting for a fully funded Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Bureau of Safety & Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) so they can have the resources they need to deploy offshore clean energy resources at the speed the science demands.
Build climate-ready fisheries
Threats like warming oceans and overfishing have caused the ocean's fish population to fall by 50% over the last 50 years, leading to cascading ecological consequences, hurting regional and local economies, and risking hunger and even conflict. Fully rebuilding America's fish stocks would support an additional 500,000 jobs and generate an addition $31 billion in sales impacts, providing a much needed economic boost to coastal communities who have been hit hard by climate change. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, our bedrock fisheries management law, provides a robust framework for managing U.S. fisheries in coordination with state governments. And as we continue to rebuild and sustainably manage our fisheries, we must ensure that our regulations are able to effectively respond to the changing ocean conditions we are witnessing as a result of climate change. I will direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service to issue new guidance and regulations to better prepare fishing industries and communities for the impacts of climate change.
Expand community-based seafood markets
As we work to restore America's fisheries, we must also rebuild the necessary infrastructure to once again support vibrant coastal communities and a local seafood economy. Today, roughly one in four fish eaten in the United States waters was caught here and sent to Asia for processing before being re-imported for American consumers. By building processing plants in the US, we can not only decrease the carbon footprint of the seafood industry, but we can also create a new class of jobs in the Blue Economy. That's why I have committed to spending $5 billion over ten years to expand USDA's Local Agriculture Market Program, funding food hubs, distribution centers, and points-of-sale.
NOAA should make it easier for fishermen to sell seafood directly to U.S. consumers and include additional vulnerable species in the Seafood Import Monitoring Program — so the public can know where their seafood comes from and that it was caught in an ethical and sustainable way. And I will invest in America's young fishers by increasing funding for new business development programs established through the Young Fishermen's Development Act.
Invest in regenerative ocean farming
Land-based farmers have long been supported by the USDA, but in a world of rising seas, increasing ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification, we must expand that support to include ocean farming as well. Algae and seaweed are the trees of our oceans, absorbing carbon and helping to reduce ocean acidification and pollution locally, and are valuable sources of nutrition. We must cultivate them just as we would any forest or aboveground ecosystem that naturally absorbs carbon dioxide. These resources even have the potential to become a key ingredient in renewable fuels — in the future, we might power our cars and airplanes on the algae grown in our seas.
I'll start by directing USDA to create a new program dedicated to research and policy development for ocean-based farming, ensuring that ocean farmers, just like any other producers, are paid for their contributions to the fight against climate change. I'll also fully include ocean farming, including shellfish and seaweed production, in critical agricultural programs, like the USDA Biomass Crop Assistance Program and disaster assistance programs, because ocean farmers should pay into and have assurance from climate-caused crop loss, just as land-based farmers currently do. And I'll include ocean farmer training programs in the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program to continue to support America's farmers of today and tomorrow.
Build climate smart ports
If global shipping were a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world. And while many of those emissions come from the dirty fuel that is used to move massive container ships through international waters, there is also more we can do here at home to ensure every ship entering American ports — no matter what country it comes from — meets our standards. This includes working with the International Maritime Organization to set aggressive emissions standards for bunker fuels, so that shipping fuels are cleaner at home and abroad.
And we can work towards fully electrifying our ports, including port equipment and shore power. This will reduce harmful air pollution for the millions of people, often disadvantaged communities, who live near ports, while also supporting new manufacturing jobs in the clean transportation sector. This is not about automation. We need safe and efficient ports, and that means unionized jobs with strong wages and comprehensive benefits. And it means standing up for American maritime workers and the men and women who work in and around ports by ensuring cargo bound for the United States is unloaded and transported by American workers. On the road to electrification, we should also immediately modernize federal trucking rules by reducing idling and congestion, empowering local ports to drastically reduce emissions. Additionally, we will require all ports to have speed reduction zones, which are one of the most efficient ways for vessels to reduce emissions. And through my Green Manufacturing plan, we will continue to invest in R&D so that we can find ways to get ships off dirty diesel.
Protecting and restoring ocean habitat
Coastal and marine habitats are our best natural defense system in the fight against climate change, storing up to 5 times more carbon per acre than tropical forests — while also often acting as cheaper and more effective sea walls. In fact, coastal wetlands reduced damages during Superstorm Sandy by $625 million. It is imperative that we restore our marine habitat to safeguard against future climate impacts, especially as climate change continues to hit our most vulnerable communities first and worst.
Restore marine ecosystems
We must restore damaged marine ecosystems like Florida's mangroves, which have been destroyed by urban coastal development. I'll start by fully funding NOAA's Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program, which partners with states to conserve coastal ecosystems. I've also proposed a 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps, which will hire 10,000 young people and veterans for new job opportunities caring for our natural resources — including restoration of marine ecosystems. And I'll make polluters pay. My Department of Justice will go after fossil fuel companies and other industry bad actors who have harmed our ocean ecosystems, recovering the money to fund restoration programs.
Expand marine protected areas
We must protect ecologically and culturally-significant places in the ocean, just like as we do on land. Marine protected areas are protected pockets of seas, oceans, or the Great Lakes which local, state and federal governments establish to protect threatened marine ecosystems and to replenish fisheries. Studies show that marine protected areas are effective management tools to rebuild fish populations and restore damaged habitats, allowing marine ecosystems to recover without the pressures of human activities like fishing, drilling, and pollution. And they can also benefit fishermen, because they replenish fish populations outside boundaries of the protected area. For example, one study found that one hectare of protected ocean produced five times as many fish as a similar unprotected hectare, raising profits for neighboring fisheries and tourism industries. I will direct NOAA to engage in robust stakeholder engagement processes to establish more marine protected areas, with the goal of increasing protection of all types of marine habitats.
Invest in marine carbon sequestration
Not all carbon in the ocean is bad. Blue carbon, or carbon stored in ocean and coastal ecosystems, is naturally sequestered by coral reefs and oyster reefs, mangrove forests and kelp forests, as well as seagrass beds and wetlands. If managed correctly, the ocean can continue to naturally sequester carbon. I will issue an Executive Order directing NOAA to build a domestic blue carbon program that will support ocean-based carbon sequestration projects, including coastal ecosystem restoration programs, just like we have for land-based carbon markets.
I will also direct NOAA to map and establish “Blue Carbon Zones” in federal waters, so that we can identify, protect, and manage these highly productive areas. While we can do more right now to further support blue carbon, we also need to make sure NOAA and the National Science Foundation have the funding they need to continue cutting edge research on blue carbon and ocean acidification.
End offshore drilling
The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill — the worst oil spill in our nation's history — caused more than $17 billion in damage to natural resources and cost eleven lives. Years later, coastal economies and ecosystems along the Gulf Coast have still not recovered. On day one of my presidency I will sign a sweeping executive order with bold actions to defeat the climate crisis, including ending all new fossil fuel leases offshore and on public lands.
But new offshore fossil fuel leases are only part of the problem — we must also phase out existing offshore drilling, which is putting the health and economies of coastal communities at risk. A Warren administration will start by reinstating the Obama Administration's Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that protected more than hundreds of millions of acres in the Atlantic Ocean and Arctic. We'll also reinstate the well safety rules that the Obama administration put in place after the BP oil spill, because the fossil fuel workers who risk their lives to power our economy deserve safe working conditions. And we'll roll back the Trump administration's decision to reduce the shallow-water royalty rate for existing offshore drilling leases. In fact, we'll go further: We'll reassess the royalty rate to more accurately account for the social cost of carbon. Over the last two decades, some of the world's largest oil companies, including Chevron, Exxon, and Shell, have skirted about $18 billion in federal royalties from offshore drilling. That ends in a Warren Administration.
I will direct federal ocean and coastal management agencies to begin planning to phase out all offshore drilling. Instead, we will focus on transitioning the offshore drilling supply chain and associated industry to offshore wind. I am committed to leaving no worker behind as we transition to 100% clean energy, and the men and women who have tirelessly worked in the offshore drilling industry are no exception. A Warren administration will provide job training and guaranteed wage and benefit parity for workers who choose to transition into new industries. And for those Americans who choose not to find new employment and wish to retire with dignity, we'll ensure full financial security, including promised pensions and early retirement benefits.
Reduce ocean trash
By 2050 there could be more plastic by mass in the sea than fish. Ocean trash is getting incorporated into the marine food chain — even ending up in the fish on our plates and in the sea salt we use to season it. To make matters worse, there are over 300 new petrochemical plastic facilities slated to come online in the U.S, and many of these mega polluters are sited for low-income communities and communities of color. A Warren administration will start upstream by working to establish policies that combat marine plastic pollution by reducing single-use plastic production, like plastic bags, and will also work downstream to establish markets for recycled materials through recycled-content standards. A Warren administration will follow the lead of NGO-industry collaboratives like the Trash Free Seas Alliance that have already made progress in this fight. And through my Green Manufacturing Plan I will invest in R&D so that we can further understand all the implications of ocean trash and can determine the best possible solutions to combat this issue going forward.
Hold Big Ag accountable for upstream pollution
Agribusinesses, with their overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, are responsible for polluting hundreds of thousands of miles of upstream waterways that flow downstream into our bays and oceans and have exacerbated toxic algal blooms, harmed marine life and contaminated drinking water. In fact, it is estimated that harmful freshwater algal blooms in the U.S. result in losses of billions — primarily from harm to property values, recreation, and drinking-water supplies. I will make agribusinesses pay the full costs of the environmental damage they wreak by closing the loopholes that CAFOs use to get away with polluting and by beefing up enforcement of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, including by working with state and local officials. And, I will reinstate the Obama-era Clean Water Rule, which provided critical protections for drinking water sources for nearly one-third of the United States. All waters of the United States should be safe for everyone to enjoy, not become a dumping ground for Big Ag.
Collective management of our international waters
And there's more — because our ocean resources are connected we must collectively work with countries around the world to protect, conserve and responsibly govern international waters. Nearly two-thirds of our oceans are characterized as the “high seas,” or waters outside of any national jurisdiction. It is critical that we manage the high seas like the collective resource that it is. Much like outer space, we must come together as a global community to determine how we all have an equal share in the use of this shared resource. As a first step toward ensuring the United States is a leader and effective partner in international waters, I will work with Congress to ratify the Law of the Sea treaty so that we are a party to this international law and can work towards updating provisions to better reflect the realities of climate change on our oceans. And then I will go one step further by supporting a ban on fishing on the high seas, as one key way to curtail illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing. Just 4.2% of the world's fish catch by volume is caught on the high seas and setting aside these waters to allow species to rebuild can have outsized ecological impacts for our global fisheries.
I will also follow Governor Inslee and the state of Washington in joining the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, a global coalition of national, subnational and indigenous jurisdictions, NGOs, businesses and other partners dedicated to taking action to protect coastal communities and livelihoods from the threat of ocean acidification. And once we rejoin the Paris Agreement, I will use the United States' leadership on the international stage to champion how the ocean can play a vital role as a critical climate solution under every nation's targets under the Paris Agreement.
Adapting in a changing climate
We cannot hold the ocean back — it is rising and rising rapidly. The world faces an increase of about 1 foot of sea level rise by midcentury if we do not curb global emissions, putting the homes of more than 50 million people at risk. And here in the United States, the picture is just as bleak. Isle de Jean Charles, a coastal island in Louisiana, has lost 98% of its land mass to sea level rise since 1955. In the coming years it could be gone — which is why for the first time ever the federal government is paying an entire community to move inland to higher ground, before it is too late. Despite efforts by the state and federal governments, climate change has displaced several native Alaska Native communities. For the Quinault Indian Nation in Washington, the rising sea level has made community relocation necessary. As our ocean continues to expand and rise as a result of climate change, we must mitigate the damage that has already been done and prepare for what will only get worse — sea level rise, storm surges and extreme weather events.
Pre-disaster mitigation
As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I want to ensure we protect the 40% of Americans who live in coastal counties. Studies have shown that every dollar invested in disaster mitigation saves $6 overall. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has proposed to slash funding for FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation grant program, making us less safe. Rather than cutting this program, we will propose to quintuple it. And, as part of my administration's pre-disaster mitigation efforts, I will direct all federal emergency management and coastal management agencies to take a holistic approach to helping communities shelter from increasingly unnatural disasters. This includes better planning for escape and evacuation plans, as well as leading by example with the federal building fleet by not building any new buildings within 1.5 meters of sea level, with exemptions as necessary for military infrastructure. Across the country, nearly half a million HUD-assisted households are in flood zones. To build on the Green Public Housing Program called for in my Protecting and Empowering Renters plan, I will ensure that we do not build any new public housing within 1.5 meters of sea level, because it is the responsibility of the federal government to protect our most vulnerable families, not intentionally put them in harm's way.
And while my administration will take a proactive approach to guarding against future sea level rise, I will honor our promises to vulnerable communities and prioritize climate adaptation and mitigation resources to ensure that we keep our communities together and intact. This includes supporting our coastal tribes and indigenous communities with grants from the federal government to aid in their efforts to protect, restore, and preserve areas that hold important ecological, cultural, or sacred significance. And it includes working with Congress to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, to establish hazard mitigation revolving loan funds so that local governments can continue to invest in the health and safety of their communities before disaster strikes.
Post-disaster mitigation
Studies show that the white and wealthy receive more federal disaster aid, despite being comparatively better off financially when it comes to withstanding a disaster. As outlined in my environmental justice plan, a Warren administration will ensure an equitable recovery from natural disasters, ensuring our most vulnerable populations get the help they need to rebuild their lives after disaster strikes. Governor Inslee rightly identified the need to protect the communities during natural disasters that live alongside our existing fossil fuel infrastructure and petrochemical plants that are peppered along our coasts. I will task the EPA, NOAA, and FEMA to implement continuous monitoring for toxic pollutants by creating “mobile monitoring” teams that track pollution released during weather events. Such a program could have protected thousands in Texas from the long term impacts of the more than 100 toxic releases that occurred during Hurricane Harvey.
Flood insurance reform
The National Flood Insurance Program is designed to help people rebuild, but in the same places that were originally flooded. This may have worked in the past, but given our changed and changing climate it often doesn't make sense to require coastal communities to rebuild in areas that are no longer safe. Similarly, communities in the flood plains of the midwest are surrounded by weak levees and will experience catastrophic flooding, not just once, but year after year. Rather than tie flood insurance to risk, which would make premiums skyrocket for some of our poorest communities living in high-risk areas, I will make it easier for existing residents to move out of flood-prone properties — both inland and coastal — including a program to buy back those properties from low-income homeowners at market value. And within my first term I will ensure the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) flood maps are fully updated, so that we can raise the standard for new construction through the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard.
Managing for drought
Climate change is likely to cause longer, harsher droughts, especially in the western United States. That means we need to plan for increased stress on critical water supplies like the Colorado River basin, where reservoir levels fell so far this year that Arizona and Nevada were forced to impose the first-ever mandatory water cuts from the river this summer. As the population continues to grow and development increases in our most drought prone states, it is important for federal and state governments to encourage responsible and smart growth.
And longer and harsher droughts mean more catastrophic wildfires in California, which over the past several years have been considered the most destructive in the state's history. Insurance claims from the 2018 California wildfire season alone have now exceeded $12 billion, after thousands of homes were burned, nearly 100 people were killed. During the 2019 fire season, millions were left without power, putting many of the state's most vulnerable communities at risk for days. These climate change fueled natural disasters often hit our most vulnerable communities the hardest, which is why my administration will prioritize resources for those that need it most. And my administration will work hand in hand with U.S. Geographical Survey and state governments to monitor and manage drought risks with attention to climate risks and trends. And I will collaborate with Tribal governments on drought management and land management practices to mitigate drought, including by incorporating traditional ecological practices wherever possible.
Investing in our Great Lakes
The Great Lakes basin is home to over 80% of North America's surface freshwater — and over 10% of the US population depends on drinking water from the Great Lakes Basin. But the Great Lakes are in trouble, from climate change to invasive species like Zebra Mussels and carp to toxic algal blooms that can be traced back to pollution from agricultural runoff. We must invest in our Great Lakes so they can continue to support their $7 billion per year fishing industry and $16 billion per year outdoor recreation industry. I will fight for a fully funded Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has proven critical for the long-term health of the Great Lakes.
Starting on day one of my presidency, I will take bold action to fight climate change. And that includes harnessing the power of our oceans to be a key part of our solution to the climate crisis. The task before us is significant, but I am confident that America is up to the challenge — both at home and around the world — to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Our oceans can underpin a sustainable food system, be a source of renewable energy and defend against the worst of climate change. The future of our planet depends on a healthy ocean, and we have no more time to waste.

"Biden Campaign Press Release - Former Richland County Council Chair Bernice G. Scott and the Renowned ""Reckoning Crew"" Endorse Joe Biden",2019-12-10T00:00:00+00:00,Joseph R. Biden,/documents/biden-campaign-press-release-former-richland-county-council-chair-bernice-g-scott-and-the,"
Columbia, South Carolina — Today, Biden for President announced former Richland County Council Chair Bernice G. Scott and her renowned grassroots volunteer and activist group, the ""Reckoning Crew,"" endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States. The group had previously backed Senator Kamala Harris.
Scott and the Reckoning Crew have been a strong force in grassroots organizing in South Carolina for more than 35 years. The group's efforts have powered campaigns to sweeping victories for decades.
""Joe Biden's support in South Carolina, particularly amongst African American voters, is undeniable and unshakable,"" said former Richland County Councilwoman Bernice Scott. ""Throughout this race he has taken hits from every angle and come out stronger. He has proven to us that he has exactly what it takes to beat Donald Trump next year.
""We previously supported Kamala Harris and believed her voice was an important one to have in this race but it's time for us to unite as one and put all of our energy behind the candidate who will not only beat Donald Trump but knows how to fix what he's broken on day one. And from there, we are confident Joe will continue to build on the history he made with Barack Obama.
""We plan on putting in the long days and long nights, working around the clock to get out the vote for Joe. We'll be making phone calls and hitting the pavement going door-to-door talking to voters about what is at stake in this election. No one can afford to stay home- and they won't if we have anything to do with it.""
Scott and the Reckoning Crew join more than 90 current and former elected officials, community activists and faith leaders in South Carolina now backing Joe Biden. Nationally, Biden for President has announced more than 825 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.

"Remarks at America's Pledge Report Launch at COP25 in Madrid, Spain",2019-12-10T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/remarks-americas-pledge-report-launch-cop25-madrid-spain,"
Mark, thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Buenas tardes.
It is great to be here in Madrid. My 20 years of Spanish lessons have finally paid off, I actually could use it.
And Mark, thank you for what you've agreed to do, being named to new U.N. Special Envoy. From what I hear, the last guy who had that job did an amazing job, so you have some pretty big shoes to fill.
I also wanted to thank Harrison Ford. Now, why he was picked to play Indiana Jones and I was not, I don't know. But anyway, one of those mysteries of Hollywood.
Governor Bill Ritter is one of the climate leaders, thank you for everything you do. And Claire, don't screw it up. COP 26 next year, we're depending on you. We will all be there, and looking forward to it.
The reason that I am here in Madrid is really very simple: I am here because no one from the White House is here. Through Bloomberg Philanthropies, we've helped build a coalition of mayors, governors, business leaders, and others who remain committed to fulfilling our end of the Paris Climate Agreement.
Bloomberg Philanthropies helped fund this important international gathering. We also brought on the experts from the Obama Administration, who were measuring and managing America's climate performance and progress. And now they're continuing their critically important work, and that's what we are presenting today.
It is not a stretch to say that the climate crisis is the greatest threat facing humanity.
More than two years ago, I joined up with Jerry Brown – who was then governor of California – to rally the American people around the Paris Climate Agreement.
So far, we have galvanized nearly 4,000 allies – cities, states, and businesses – all dedicated to meeting our climate goals. We call this effort America's Pledge – and we are fulfilling it.
Just to give you a sense of the size and the scope, America's Pledge represents 68 percent of American gross domestic product, 65 percent of the U.S. population, and more than half of U.S. emissions.
Put it another way, if we were our own country, we would have an economy larger than China's or any other nation in the world, except the entire United States itself.
Now some of you may recall that back in 2017, at COP 23 in Bonn, we released a comprehensive survey of U.S. climate actions.
Last year, at the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, we released what was the most robust assessment of the impact of those actions. And today, here in Madrid, building on that foundation, we are glad to release our look ahead to the year 2030 and share what an ambitious federal climate policy could accomplish in the decade ahead.
Our new report is entitled 'Accelerating America's Pledge: Going All-In to Build a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Economy for the United States.' In the report, we detail what we need to do to fight climate change and grow our economy at the same time.
We must accelerate toward 100 percent clean electricity and energy, de-carbonize buildings, transportation, and industry, and enhance the carbon storage potential of our forests, farms, and wetlands.
In a moment, I will officially present our report to Secretary Espinosa, something that America had an obligation to do before it dropped out of the climate agreement. But first, let me just touch on two scenarios that it outlines.
In scenario number one, in the U.S., cities, states, and businesses continue what we call bottom-up leadership, without federal intervention.
Again, that's not ideal – we could accomplish a lot more, a lot faster, if the federal government worked with us instead of against us. But a significant expansion of bottom-up action alone could reduce U.S. emissions by 37 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
In scenario number two, we combine local, bottom-up leadership in the U.S. with aggressive, national action after the election year 2020. We've done the analysis – and this joint approach could reduce U.S. emissions by nearly half of the 2005 levels in 2030.
That's encouraging. It would lay the foundation for a fully decarbonized economy by mid-century, which is in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
So, today, I ask that regardless of what you hear out of Washington, you should know that the American people support our Paris goals. We continue to work to meet them. We're making encouraging progress. We're looking forward to this November's election and a new president in 2020. We have to have America as part of the solution, and I'm determined to try to make that happen. We have the roadmap to drive the progress that we need over the next decade.
While I'm in Madrid, I'm meeting with environmental and business leaders from around the world, so that we can plan our next steps together – on bottom-up actions, climate finance, national policy, and more.
Mother Nature doesn't wait on any election calendar –so neither can we.
And now, as promised, I would like to have the Secretary come up here, Secretary Espinosa.
Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us and for your continued leadership. I'm glad you managed to get here. Sorry for the fog, I'm apologizing for the Spanish government for that, but that's okay.
Would you please say a few words and accept this as this is America's answer to filling in for what the U.S. government did not want to do. We said we're all in, and we mean to continue doing what we're doing.

Statement by Michael Bennet on Articles of Impeachment,2019-12-10T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/statement-michael-bennet-articles-impeachment,"
MANCHESTER, NH — Michael Bennet released the following statement after House Democrats announced articles of impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress:
""We have to follow due process and the rule of law, but if the evidence of the President's wrongdoing and abuse of power continues to remain consistent with what we've seen, it's likely I will vote to impeach. The President has made it very difficult for Congress to do the oversight that the Constitution requires and that the American people demand. He's obstructed and stonewalled at every step of the way, and today's announcement reflects that. This is exactly what the founders were worried about. We don't elect kings in this country, and nobody is above the law.""

Statement by Elizabeth Warren - We Need a Blue New Deal for Our Oceans,2019-12-10T00:00:00+00:00,Elizabeth Warren,/documents/statement-elizabeth-warren-we-need-blue-new-deal-for-our-oceans,"
By Elizabeth Warren
In September, I attended a CNN town hall on the climate crisis. That night, Bren Smith, an ocean farmer from Connecticut, asked me if I would support a Blue New Deal to restore our oceans, in addition to our efforts to fight climate change on land. I said I would, and I meant it — here's what I'll do to rebuild our blue economy, protect and restore ocean habitat, and adapt in a climate changed world.
The world's oceans are in crisis. Across the planet, more than 90% of global fish stocks are fully exploited or overfished. The ocean has absorbed 93% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, warming the waters disrupting migration patterns, bleaching coral reefs, and fueling sea level rise.  of the carbon pollution we have pumped into the air has been absorbed in our oceans, leading to ocean acidification, changing the very chemistry of seawater. And pollution from land — whether from manufacturing, agricultural runoff, or plastic waste — is causing dead zones in our waterways and Great Lakes.
Our coasts are flooding and eroding, threatening the 40% of Americans who live in coastal counties. Our safety, public health, food security, and infrastructure are at risk. If we do not act now, things will only get worse, as climate change leads to more severe weather.
I am proud to be one of the original co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, which charts a path to transition to a 100% clean energy future, while rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and creating millions of good paying, union jobs. Environmental justice and economic justice go hand-in-hand, and I am committed to making the climate crisis and the inequality crisis top priorities in my administration.
As we pursue climate justice, we must not lose sight of the 71% of our planet covered by the ocean. While the ocean is severely threatened, it can also be a major part of the climate solution — from providing new sources of clean energy to supporting a new future of ocean farming. That is why I believe that a Blue New Deal must be an essential part of any Green New Deal — helping us fight climate change, protecting our health, and creating good, high-wage union jobs in the process.
Rebuilding our Blue Economy
Oceans already support millions of jobs, underpin our food system and contributes $304 billion to our national GDP. They also have the potential to be one of our strongest tools in the fight against climate change. Three billion people around the world depend on wild-caught and farmed seafood as a major source of protein. Yet decades of overfishing, pollution, and climate impacts have pushed our oceans to the brink of collapse. We know that we can have a highly productive ocean. In fact, ocean-related jobs have grown at three times the rate of the national average. It's time to restore our oceans and harness the potential of the Blue Economy.
Expand offshore renewable energy
As we rapidly transition our economy to 100% clean energy, we must prioritize offshore wind and wave energy. Offshore wind is more consistent than onshore wind and could provide four times the present capacity of our grid. By 2030, offshore wind energy development from Maryland to Maine could support more than 36,000 full time jobs. But the Trump administration and government red tape have bogged down existing projects, making development cumbersome and untenable. Despite a decade of effort, the Block Island Offshore Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island remains the only offshore wind project operating in the United States.
This will change in a Warren administration. As president, I will work to streamline and fast-track permitting for offshore renewable energy, including making sure projects are sited with care based on environmental impact assessments. And I will make sure that the communities hosting this new development receive a share of the benefits. Community Benefit Agreements can help address power imbalances between project developers and low-income communities by setting labor, environmental, and transparency standards before work begins. I'll make additional federal subsidies or tax benefits for large offshore renewable energy projects contingent on strong Community Benefits Agreements, which should include requirements for prevailing wages and collective bargaining rights. And I'll insist on a clawback provision if a company doesn't hold up its end of the deal. If developers work with communities to ensure that everyone benefits from clean energy development, we will be able to reduce our emissions faster. Due to the urgency and complexity of building offshore renewable energy projects, my administration will seek to execute Project Labor Agreements to govern the construction and maintenance of these projects so as to ensure a constant supply of qualified, trained workers — and creating good, union jobs in the process.
My Green Manufacturing plan also calls for a $2 trillion investment to incentivize American-made clean energy, and that includes offshore wind. My administration will work to ensure that all offshore wind infrastructure is made with a completely domestic supply chain, including American iron, steel and cement and that American crews on American vessels will be used to ferry the goods and workers to build and maintain these farms, creating more new American jobs. And I will make sure that fishing and conservation groups, as well as coastal communities, have a seat at the table in developing any new project to ensure that an expanded offshore wind industry can successfully coexist with vibrant fishing industries and healthy ocean and coastal habitats. And I won't allow visual and aesthetic impacts to provide a basis for denying federal offshore wind energy permits. The climate crisis is too urgent to let the ultra-wealthy complain about wind turbines getting in the way of their ocean views.
Additionally, my Green Apollo Program commits $400 billion over the next decade to R&D for clean energy, including harnessing power from wave energy, so that it becomes technologically and financially viable. I will also fight for long term extensions to two critical tax credits for renewable energy, the Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit, while also fighting for a fully funded Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Bureau of Safety & Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) so they can have the resources they need to deploy offshore clean energy resources at the speed the science demands.
Build climate-ready fisheries
Threats like warming oceans and overfishing have caused the ocean's fish population to fall by 50% over the last 50 years, leading to cascading ecological consequences, hurting regional and local economies, and risking hunger and even conflict. Fully rebuilding America's fish stocks would support an additional 500,000 jobs and generate an addition $31 billion in sales impacts, providing a much needed economic boost to coastal communities who have been hit hard by climate change. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, our bedrock fisheries management law, provides a robust framework for managing U.S. fisheries in coordination with state governments. And as we continue to rebuild and sustainably manage our fisheries, we must ensure that our regulations are able to effectively respond to the changing ocean conditions we are witnessing as a result of climate change. I will direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service to issue new guidance and regulations to better prepare fishing industries and communities for the impacts of climate change.
Expand community-based seafood markets
As we work to restore America's fisheries, we must also rebuild the necessary infrastructure to once again support vibrant coastal communities and a local seafood economy. Today, roughly one in four fish eaten in the United States waters was caught here and sent to Asia for processing before being re-imported for American consumers. By building processing plants in the US, we can not only decrease the carbon footprint of the seafood industry, but we can also create a new class of jobs in the Blue Economy. That's why I have committed to spending $5 billion over ten years to expand USDA's Local Agriculture Market Program, funding food hubs, distribution centers, and points-of-sale.
NOAA should make it easier for fishermen to sell seafood directly to U.S. consumers and include additional vulnerable species in the Seafood Import Monitoring Program — so the public can know where their seafood comes from and that it was caught in an ethical and sustainable way. And I will invest in America's young fishers by increasing funding for new business development programs established through the Young Fishermen's Development Act.
Invest in regenerative ocean farming
Land-based farmers have long been supported by the USDA, but in a world of rising seas, increasing ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification, we must expand that support to include ocean farming as well. Algae and seaweed are the trees of our oceans, absorbing carbon and helping to reduce ocean acidification and pollution locally, and are valuable sources of nutrition. We must cultivate them just as we would any forest or aboveground ecosystem that naturally absorbs carbon dioxide. These resources even have the potential to become a key ingredient in renewable fuels — in the future, we might power our cars and airplanes on the algae grown in our seas.
I'll start by directing USDA to create a new program dedicated to research and policy development for ocean-based farming, ensuring that ocean farmers, just like any other producers, are paid for their contributions to the fight against climate change. I'll also fully include ocean farming, including shellfish and seaweed production, in critical agricultural programs, like the USDA Biomass Crop Assistance Program and disaster assistance programs, because ocean farmers should pay into and have assurance from climate-caused crop loss, just as land-based farmers currently do. And I'll include ocean farmer training programs in the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program to continue to support America's farmers of today and tomorrow.
Build climate smart ports
If global shipping were a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world. And while many of those emissions come from the dirty fuel that is used to move massive container ships through international waters, there is also more we can do here at home to ensure every ship entering American ports — no matter what country it comes from — meets our standards. This includes working with the International Maritime Organization to set aggressive emissions standards for bunker fuels, so that shipping fuels are cleaner at home and abroad.
And we can work towards fully electrifying our ports, including port equipment and shore power. This will reduce harmful air pollution for the millions of people, often disadvantaged communities, who live near ports, while also supporting new manufacturing jobs in the clean transportation sector. This is not about automation. We need safe and efficient ports, and that means unionized jobs with strong wages and comprehensive benefits. And it means standing up for American maritime workers and the men and women who work in and around ports by ensuring cargo bound for the United States is unloaded and transported by American workers. On the road to electrification, we should also immediately modernize federal trucking rules by reducing idling and congestion, empowering local ports to drastically reduce emissions. Additionally, we will require all ports to have speed reduction zones, which are one of the most efficient ways for vessels to reduce emissions. And through my Green Manufacturing plan, we will continue to invest in R&D so that we can find ways to get ships off dirty diesel.
Protecting and restoring ocean habitat
Coastal and marine habitats are our best natural defense system in the fight against climate change, storing up to 5 times more carbon per acre than tropical forests — while also often acting as cheaper and more effective sea walls. In fact, coastal wetlands reduced damages during Superstorm Sandy by $625 million. It is imperative that we restore our marine habitat to safeguard against future climate impacts, especially as climate change continues to hit our most vulnerable communities first and worst.
Restore marine ecosystems
We must restore damaged marine ecosystems like Florida's mangroves, which have been destroyed by urban coastal development. I'll start by fully funding NOAA's Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program, which partners with states to conserve coastal ecosystems. I've also proposed a 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps, which will hire 10,000 young people and veterans for new job opportunities caring for our natural resources — including restoration of marine ecosystems. And I'll make polluters pay. My Department of Justice will go after fossil fuel companies and other industry bad actors who have harmed our ocean ecosystems, recovering the money to fund restoration programs.
Expand marine protected areas
We must protect ecologically and culturally-significant places in the ocean, just like as we do on land. Marine protected areas are protected pockets of seas, oceans, or the Great Lakes which local, state and federal governments establish to protect threatened marine ecosystems and to replenish fisheries. Studies show that marine protected areas are effective management tools to rebuild fish populations and restore damaged habitats, allowing marine ecosystems to recover without the pressures of human activities like fishing, drilling, and pollution. And they can also benefit fishermen, because they replenish fish populations outside boundaries of the protected area. For example, one study found that one hectare of protected ocean produced five times as many fish as a similar unprotected hectare, raising profits for neighboring fisheries and tourism industries. I will direct NOAA to engage in robust stakeholder engagement processes to establish more marine protected areas, with the goal of increasing protection of all types of marine habitats.
Invest in marine carbon sequestration
Not all carbon in the ocean is bad. Blue carbon, or carbon stored in ocean and coastal ecosystems, is naturally sequestered by coral reefs and oyster reefs, mangrove forests and kelp forests, as well as seagrass beds and wetlands. If managed correctly, the ocean can continue to naturally sequester carbon. I will issue an Executive Order directing NOAA to build a domestic blue carbon program that will support ocean-based carbon sequestration projects, including coastal ecosystem restoration programs, just like we have for land-based carbon markets.
I will also direct NOAA to map and establish “Blue Carbon Zones” in federal waters, so that we can identify, protect, and manage these highly productive areas. While we can do more right now to further support blue carbon, we also need to make sure NOAA and the National Science Foundation have the funding they need to continue cutting edge research on blue carbon and ocean acidification.
End offshore drilling
The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill — the worst oil spill in our nation's history — caused more than $17 billion in damage to natural resources and cost eleven lives. Years later, coastal economies and ecosystems along the Gulf Coast have still not recovered. On day one of my presidency I will sign a sweeping executive order with bold actions to defeat the climate crisis, including ending all new fossil fuel leases offshore and on public lands.
But new offshore fossil fuel leases are only part of the problem — we must also phase out existing offshore drilling, which is putting the health and economies of coastal communities at risk. A Warren administration will start by reinstating the Obama Administration's Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that protected more than hundreds of millions of acres in the Atlantic Ocean and Arctic. We'll also reinstate the well safety rules that the Obama administration put in place after the BP oil spill, because the fossil fuel workers who risk their lives to power our economy deserve safe working conditions. And we'll roll back the Trump administration's decision to reduce the shallow-water royalty rate for existing offshore drilling leases. In fact, we'll go further: We'll reassess the royalty rate to more accurately account for the social cost of carbon. Over the last two decades, some of the world's largest oil companies, including Chevron, Exxon, and Shell, have skirted about $18 billion in federal royalties from offshore drilling. That ends in a Warren Administration.
I will direct federal ocean and coastal management agencies to begin planning to phase out all offshore drilling. Instead, we will focus on transitioning the offshore drilling supply chain and associated industry to offshore wind. I am committed to leaving no worker behind as we transition to 100% clean energy, and the men and women who have tirelessly worked in the offshore drilling industry are no exception. A Warren administration will provide job training and guaranteed wage and benefit parity for workers who choose to transition into new industries. And for those Americans who choose not to find new employment and wish to retire with dignity, we'll ensure full financial security, including promised pensions and early retirement benefits.
Reduce ocean trash
By 2050 there could be more plastic by mass in the sea than fish. Ocean trash is getting incorporated into the marine food chain — even ending up in the fish on our plates and in the sea salt we use to season it. To make matters worse, there are over 300 new petrochemical plastic facilities slated to come online in the U.S, and many of these mega polluters are sited for low-income communities and communities of color. A Warren administration will start upstream by working to establish policies that combat marine plastic pollution by reducing single-use plastic production, like plastic bags, and will also work downstream to establish markets for recycled materials through recycled-content standards. A Warren administration will follow the lead of NGO-industry collaboratives like the Trash Free Seas Alliance that have already made progress in this fight. And through my Green Manufacturing Plan I will invest in R&D so that we can further understand all the implications of ocean trash and can determine the best possible solutions to combat this issue going forward.
Hold Big Ag accountable for upstream pollution
Agribusinesses, with their overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, are responsible for polluting hundreds of thousands of miles of upstream waterways that flow downstream into our bays and oceans and have exacerbated toxic algal blooms, harmed marine life and contaminated drinking water. In fact, it is estimated that harmful freshwater algal blooms in the U.S. result in losses of billions — primarily from harm to property values, recreation, and drinking-water supplies. I will make agribusinesses pay the full costs of the environmental damage they wreak by closing the loopholes that CAFOs use to get away with polluting and by beefing up enforcement of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, including by working with state and local officials. And, I will reinstate the Obama-era Clean Water Rule, which provided critical protections for drinking water sources for nearly one-third of the United States. All waters of the United States should be safe for everyone to enjoy, not become a dumping ground for Big Ag.
Collective management of our international waters
And there's more — because our ocean resources are connected we must collectively work with countries around the world to protect, conserve and responsibly govern international waters. Nearly two-thirds of our oceans are characterized as the “high seas,” or waters outside of any national jurisdiction. It is critical that we manage the high seas like the collective resource that it is. Much like outer space, we must come together as a global community to determine how we all have an equal share in the use of this shared resource. As a first step toward ensuring the United States is a leader and effective partner in international waters, I will work with Congress to ratify the Law of the Sea treaty so that we are a party to this international law and can work towards updating provisions to better reflect the realities of climate change on our oceans. And then I will go one step further by supporting a ban on fishing on the high seas, as one key way to curtail illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing. Just 4.2% of the world's fish catch by volume is caught on the high seas and setting aside these waters to allow species to rebuild can have outsized ecological impacts for our global fisheries.
I will also follow Governor Inslee and the state of Washington in joining the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, a global coalition of national, subnational and indigenous jurisdictions, NGOs, businesses and other partners dedicated to taking action to protect coastal communities and livelihoods from the threat of ocean acidification. And once we rejoin the Paris Agreement, I will use the United States' leadership on the international stage to champion how the ocean can play a vital role as a critical climate solution under every nation's targets under the Paris Agreement.
Adapting in a changing climate
We cannot hold the ocean back — it is rising and rising rapidly. The world faces an increase of about 1 foot of sea level rise by midcentury if we do not curb global emissions, putting the homes of more than 50 million people at risk. And here in the United States, the picture is just as bleak. Isle de Jean Charles, a coastal island in Louisiana, has lost 98% of its land mass to sea level rise since 1955. In the coming years it could be gone — which is why for the first time ever the federal government is paying an entire community to move inland to higher ground, before it is too late. Despite efforts by the state and federal governments, climate change has displaced several native Alaska Native communities. For the Quinault Indian Nation in Washington, the rising sea level has made community relocation necessary. As our ocean continues to expand and rise as a result of climate change, we must mitigate the damage that has already been done and prepare for what will only get worse — sea level rise, storm surges and extreme weather events.
Pre-disaster mitigation
As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I want to ensure we protect the 40% of Americans who live in coastal counties. Studies have shown that every dollar invested in disaster mitigation saves $6 overall. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has proposed to slash funding for FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation grant program, making us less safe. Rather than cutting this program, we will propose to quintuple it. And, as part of my administration's pre-disaster mitigation efforts, I will direct all federal emergency management and coastal management agencies to take a holistic approach to helping communities shelter from increasingly unnatural disasters. This includes better planning for escape and evacuation plans, as well as leading by example with the federal building fleet by not building any new buildings within 1.5 meters of sea level, with exemptions as necessary for military infrastructure. Across the country, nearly half a million HUD-assisted households are in flood zones. To build on the Green Public Housing Program called for in my Protecting and Empowering Renters plan, I will ensure that we do not build any new public housing within 1.5 meters of sea level, because it is the responsibility of the federal government to protect our most vulnerable families, not intentionally put them in harm's way.
And while my administration will take a proactive approach to guarding against future sea level rise, I will honor our promises to vulnerable communities and prioritize climate adaptation and mitigation resources to ensure that we keep our communities together and intact. This includes supporting our coastal tribes and indigenous communities with grants from the federal government to aid in their efforts to protect, restore, and preserve areas that hold important ecological, cultural, or sacred significance. And it includes working with Congress to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, to establish hazard mitigation revolving loan funds so that local governments can continue to invest in the health and safety of their communities before disaster strikes.
Post-disaster mitigation
Studies show that the white and wealthy receive more federal disaster aid, despite being comparatively better off financially when it comes to withstanding a disaster. As outlined in my environmental justice plan, a Warren administration will ensure an equitable recovery from natural disasters, ensuring our most vulnerable populations get the help they need to rebuild their lives after disaster strikes. Governor Inslee rightly identified the need to protect the communities during natural disasters that live alongside our existing fossil fuel infrastructure and petrochemical plants that are peppered along our coasts. I will task the EPA, NOAA, and FEMA to implement continuous monitoring for toxic pollutants by creating “mobile monitoring” teams that track pollution released during weather events. Such a program could have protected thousands in Texas from the long term impacts of the more than 100 toxic releases that occurred during Hurricane Harvey.
Flood insurance reform
The National Flood Insurance Program is designed to help people rebuild, but in the same places that were originally flooded. This may have worked in the past, but given our changed and changing climate it often doesn't make sense to require coastal communities to rebuild in areas that are no longer safe. Similarly, communities in the flood plains of the midwest are surrounded by weak levees and will experience catastrophic flooding, not just once, but year after year. Rather than tie flood insurance to risk, which would make premiums skyrocket for some of our poorest communities living in high-risk areas, I will make it easier for existing residents to move out of flood-prone properties — both inland and coastal — including a program to buy back those properties from low-income homeowners at market value. And within my first term I will ensure the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) flood maps are fully updated, so that we can raise the standard for new construction through the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard.
Managing for drought
Climate change is likely to cause longer, harsher droughts, especially in the western United States. That means we need to plan for increased stress on critical water supplies like the Colorado River basin, where reservoir levels fell so far this year that Arizona and Nevada were forced to impose the first-ever mandatory water cuts from the river this summer. As the population continues to grow and development increases in our most drought prone states, it is important for federal and state governments to encourage responsible and smart growth.
And longer and harsher droughts mean more catastrophic wildfires in California, which over the past several years have been considered the most destructive in the state's history. Insurance claims from the 2018 California wildfire season alone have now exceeded $12 billion, after thousands of homes were burned, nearly 100 people were killed. During the 2019 fire season, millions were left without power, putting many of the state's most vulnerable communities at risk for days. These climate change fueled natural disasters often hit our most vulnerable communities the hardest, which is why my administration will prioritize resources for those that need it most. And my administration will work hand in hand with U.S. Geographical Survey and state governments to monitor and manage drought risks with attention to climate risks and trends. And I will collaborate with Tribal governments on drought management and land management practices to mitigate drought, including by incorporating traditional ecological practices wherever possible.
Investing in our Great Lakes
The Great Lakes basin is home to over 80% of North America's surface freshwater — and over 10% of the US population depends on drinking water from the Great Lakes Basin. But the Great Lakes are in trouble, from climate change to invasive species like Zebra Mussels and carp to toxic algal blooms that can be traced back to pollution from agricultural runoff. We must invest in our Great Lakes so they can continue to support their $7 billion per year fishing industry and $16 billion per year outdoor recreation industry. I will fight for a fully funded Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has proven critical for the long-term health of the Great Lakes.
Starting on day one of my presidency, I will take bold action to fight climate change. And that includes harnessing the power of our oceans to be a key part of our solution to the climate crisis. The task before us is significant, but I am confident that America is up to the challenge — both at home and around the world — to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Our oceans can underpin a sustainable food system, be a source of renewable energy and defend against the worst of climate change. The future of our planet depends on a healthy ocean, and we have no more time to waste.

"Biden Campaign Press Release - Former Richland County Council Chair Bernice G. Scott and the Renowned ""Reckoning Crew"" Endorse Joe Biden",2019-12-10T00:00:00+00:00,Joseph R. Biden,/documents/biden-campaign-press-release-former-richland-county-council-chair-bernice-g-scott-and-the,"
Columbia, South Carolina — Today, Biden for President announced former Richland County Council Chair Bernice G. Scott and her renowned grassroots volunteer and activist group, the ""Reckoning Crew,"" endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States. The group had previously backed Senator Kamala Harris.
Scott and the Reckoning Crew have been a strong force in grassroots organizing in South Carolina for more than 35 years. The group's efforts have powered campaigns to sweeping victories for decades.
""Joe Biden's support in South Carolina, particularly amongst African American voters, is undeniable and unshakable,"" said former Richland County Councilwoman Bernice Scott. ""Throughout this race he has taken hits from every angle and come out stronger. He has proven to us that he has exactly what it takes to beat Donald Trump next year.
""We previously supported Kamala Harris and believed her voice was an important one to have in this race but it's time for us to unite as one and put all of our energy behind the candidate who will not only beat Donald Trump but knows how to fix what he's broken on day one. And from there, we are confident Joe will continue to build on the history he made with Barack Obama.
""We plan on putting in the long days and long nights, working around the clock to get out the vote for Joe. We'll be making phone calls and hitting the pavement going door-to-door talking to voters about what is at stake in this election. No one can afford to stay home- and they won't if we have anything to do with it.""
Scott and the Reckoning Crew join more than 90 current and former elected officials, community activists and faith leaders in South Carolina now backing Joe Biden. Nationally, Biden for President has announced more than 825 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg To Re-Engage America in the Global Effort to Fight Climate Change,2019-12-09T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-mike-bloomberg-re-engage-america-the-global-effort-fight,"
Bloomberg Will Rejoin the Paris Agreement In First Act as President and Increase U.S. Commitment to Reduce Emissions
New York, New York – Mike Bloomberg today announced that he will re-engage America in the global fight against climate change as President, rejoining the Paris Agreement as his first act and increasing the U.S. commitment to reduce emissions. Tomorrow, Mike will attend the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Madrid, where he will deliver the latest report from America's Pledge, a group he co-founded after Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. America's Pledge quantifies and communicates the climate progress of the nearly 4,000 cities, states and businesses – representing nearly 70 percent of the country's GDP – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions despite inaction by the federal government.
As President, Mike will build off his extensive track record as one of America's leading climate activists, putting an unprecedented focus on climate in the general election and making climate change one of his top priorities once elected. While Mayor of New York City, Mike pioneered the most comprehensive sustainability plan in the country, setting a new standard for what cities can accomplish in the fight against climate change. Mike served under the two most recent UN Secretary-Generals as a Special Envoy for climate, and earlier this year Mike created Beyond Carbon, the largest coordinated initiative on climate change ever undertaken to turbo-charge work underway in nearly every corner of the country.
""Trump has failed to address the most urgent issue of our time,"" said Senior Advisor Brynne Craig. ""Fortunately, Mike Bloomberg has been ahead of the climate crisis for many years. Mike has successfully taken on the coal industry and his extensive climate work with cities, states and businesses shows a way forward for America. As President, Mike will ensure the federal government builds on progress made around the country, helping us finally achieve a clean energy future. This election matters more for the climate than any other in history.""
Mike will highlight key initiatives from his climate agenda domestically and internationally throughout the week across a series of events and announcements. The campaign today launched its first ad focusing on climate change targeting President Trump's lack of leadership on climate issues – a digital spot in California titled ""Smoke and Fire,"" contrasting President Trump ""the climate denier"" with Mike's successful effort to move from coal to renewable energy. The ad is here.
Later this week, Mike will travel to California to announce policies to curtail the region's record wildfires. Further details will be announced later in the week.
Highlights of his international climate initiatives include: 

Consult with cities, states, and tribal governments to create a national roadmap to achieve the new 2030 target, and holding immediate talks with the top 20 emitting countries to bring them into alignment as well.
Hold governments accountable and penalize corporations responsible for deforestation that rob people of their lives and communities.
Calculate the costs of U.S. climate change efforts and apply a corresponding border adjustment – a charge on imports and a tax break for exports – for emissions-intensive goods.
Establish a precedent for supporting people permanently displaced by climate change by creating an entry point to apply for refugee status in the United States.
Use trade and security agreements to strongly encourage that all countries with whom we have diplomatic relations are party to the Paris Agreement and have a verifiable plan to reduce emissions.
Put military bases on a path to self-sufficiency. Improve the resilience of all infrastructure that the military relies on at home and abroad from the effects of climate change, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

South Bend, IN –– Today, Mike Schmuhl, campaign manager for Pete for America, released the following statement:
""In a continued commitment to transparency, we are announcing today that our campaign will open fundraisers to reporters, and will release the names of people raising money for our campaign. Fundraising events with Pete will be open to press beginning tomorrow, and a list of people raising money for the campaign will be released within the week.
""From the start, Pete has said it is important for every candidate to be open and honest, and his actions have reflected that commitment. He is the only current presidential candidate who has released the names of people raising money for his campaign, and we will continue to release additional names as more people join our growing effort. Moreover, he will be one of the few candidates to allow reporters access to his fundraising events.
""Our campaign strives to be the most transparent in the field. Pete has held three multi-day bus tours with reporters that were completely on the record, has previously released the names of people who have fundraised for our campaign, and made public 12 years of tax returns, which includes all of the mayor's professional working life since he finished his education. Pete has also committed to restoring press briefings in the White House.
""No other candidate for president has released the entirety of their tax returns since their education concluded. No other current candidate for president has released the names of people raising money for their campaign. There are important differences in this race among Democratic candidates, from creating a choice of affordable health care choices for all to removing cost as a barrier to college for those who need it, but transparency shouldn't be one of them.
""We plan to continue to talk about the issues that matter most to voters, because Pete is more interested in bringing people together to solve the critical issues facing America. This election is about defeating Donald Trump and uniting the country the day after this president leaves office. Pete is the best candidate to beat Trump, and we remain focused on doing just that in 2020.""

Mayor Liccardo Will Provide Strategic and Policy Counsel to Campaign
NEW YORK, NEW YORK – Today, Mike Bloomberg 2020 announced that San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo will serve as California co-chair of the campaign. Liccardo will advise the Bloomberg campaign on strategy, policy, and serve as a surrogate. Additional California co-chairs will be announced in the coming weeks.
Mayor Liccardo has been an important leader nationally in battling climate change, an issue that Bloomberg has made one of the cornerstones of his campaign, and that will be one of his top priorities as President. Under Liccardo's focused leadership, San Jose became the largest US city to launch a community choice energy program that has boosted the share of clean energy sources for San Jose's electricity to 80%. Under Mayor Liccardo's visionary leadership, San Jose became the largest US city to require all-electric construction of all new residential and municipal buildings. Amid the greatest economic expansion in San Jose history, Liccardo led historic efforts to preserve thousands of acres of open space and hillsides against development. He's spearheaded bold efforts to expand economic opportunity in San Jose, in 2016 leading a regional increase of the minimum wage to $15 per hour. He launched programs to eliminate financial barriers to college for 1,600 low-income students, to engage more than 4,000 teenagers in gang-impacted neighborhoods in summer jobs, to open coding camps to more than 7,000 public school students, and to bridge the digital divide for thousands of low-income families with the nation's first privately financed digital inclusion initiative. He's become a trusted voice among his peers, recently galvanizing dozens of California mayors in a proposal for a customer buyout of the bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) utility.
""Mayor Liccardo has been a leader on a number of critical issues, especially climate, which Mike has made one of his top priorities for this campaign,"" said Kevin Sheekey, Campaign Manager for Mike 2020. ""We're playing to win and California will be an important part of our success. We're thrilled to have Mayor Liccardo as part of the team.""
""Mayors don't have the luxury of hyperpartisan tongue-wagging,"" said Mayor Liccardo, ""they have to solve problems and get things done. I'm supporting Mike Bloomberg because as mayor of the nation's largest, most diverse, and most complex city, Mike solved problems  — to reduce poverty, expand jobs, cut gun violence, improve public health, and build affordable housing. As President, Mike Bloomberg will bring his courageous, innovative, and pragmatic leadership to our nation's great challenges, to do what's right and make tough decisions regardless of what he might hear from the powerful, the pundits, or the polls.""
Mayor Sam Liccardo took office in 2015, and was reelected in 2018 with 76% of the vote.  Prior to Liccardo's time as an elected official, he prosecuted sexual assaults and other felony cases as a criminal prosecutor.
Liccardo serves on a number of boards, including the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Valley Transit Authority, where he has led efforts to fund and construct a ""ring of rail"" around the Bay Area, by connecting the BART and CalTrain transit systems in Downtown San Jose. He serves as co-chair for Joint Venture Silicon Valley, is a senior fellow for the American Leadership Forum-Silicon Valley, and is a Rodel Fellow at the Aspen Institute.
Liccardo graduated from Georgetown University, received a law degree from Harvard Law School, and a master's degree from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.

""This is further testament to Andrew Yang's commitment to the Granite State,"" said New Hampshire State Director Khrystina Snell. ""We are in it to win it. Andrew Yang's vision of a New Way Forward is on full display in New Hampshire, where efforts such as the Pledge For Humanity initiative see our supporters going out into the neighborhoods and helping their fellow human beings.

Bennet Campaign Press Release - No Kid Hungry Founder Billy Shore Endorses Michael Bennet As Candidate Unveils Comprehensive Anti-Poverty Agenda in NH,2019-12-09T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-press-release-no-kid-hungry-founder-billy-shore-endorses-michael-bennet,"
MANCHESTER, NH — Billy Shore, founder of leading anti-poverty and hunger relief organization Share Our Strength/No Kid Hungry, endorsed Michael Bennet on Sunday, as Bennet unveiled his comprehensive anti-poverty agenda at a town hall in Manchester.
Bennet's plan will:

Cut child poverty in half by the end of his first year in office;
Cut adult poverty in half by the end of his first term;
Eliminate homelessness by the end of his second term; and
Put America on the path to completely eliminate poverty within a generation.

""We have proven that progress on the road to ending poverty is possible, but to truly tackle hunger, we must get at the root causes,"" said Shore, who has led his organization in raising more than $700 million to fight poverty and hunger. ""The best thing that we can do for children struggling in poverty is to invest in their parents and families—which is exactly what Michael's plan does. It's the most comprehensive anti-poverty agenda I've seen in my 35 years working on this issue.
""At the end of the day, what's most important is not what Michael Bennet says about this plan, but what this plan says about Michael Bennet. There is no other candidate in this race who has the experience or commitment to actually make progress for kids and families across the country—especially those living in poverty. We all know that kids don't vote, and there are no political points to be scored by making your campaign about them. The only reason to do it is because it's the right thing to do. This plan is a reflection of the Senator's independence, integrity, and vision, and I am proud to endorse him,"" said Shore.
""As president, I will lead from the White House with one central question in mind: Will this help or hurt the next generation?"" said Bennet. ""In my own life in public service—from my tenure as Superintendent of Denver Public Schools to my work in the Senate—I've seen the devastating effects poverty has on kids and their families. We have a choice to make in this election and as a country about what our priorities are, and mine are different from other candidates. There should be no greater priority than ending poverty, and I'm honored to see tireless leaders like Billy endorse my approach.""
In addition to being a nationally renowned leader on ending poverty, Shore was a senior aide to former Senator Gary Hart during his insurgent victory in the Granite State during the 1984 Democratic presidential primary.
""At this point in the calendar, Senator Hart barely registered in the polls, but the momentum with voters was palpable,"" said Shore. ""I am having that same sense today with Michael, who I believe is going to pull off a similar upset victory.""

PLAN TO END POVERTY
One out of every eight Americans—about 40 million people, including nearly 10 million children—live in poverty in the United States. Our child poverty rate is among the highest of any advanced economy, and child poverty alone costs the United States between $800 billion and $1.1 trillion each year, an aggregation of the detrimental effects of poverty on human health, earning potential, incarceration, and so many other harms that last a lifetime.
The numbers are even more distressing for communities of color: Black and Latino children are more than twice as likely to grow up in poverty as white children. Those disparities are reinforced by segregated housing and school districts that concentrate poverty and deny many children a fair opportunity to rise into the middle class. This has resulted in deteriorating economic mobility and rising inequality, as well as stubborn racial gaps in wealth, income, health, education, incarceration, and a host of other areas.
There aren't just disparities along racial lines, but also regional lines. Poverty rates in rural areas are 25 percent higher than in metropolitan areas.
Living in poverty is a daily and persistent crisis for families experiencing it. Behind the numbers are individual stories of struggle, stress, and pain that have no place in the wealthiest country the world has ever known. Yet the politicians in Washington almost never discuss—much less grapple with—the huge disparities faced by kids like the ones I served as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, the majority of whom are kids of color and kids living in poverty. These students are doing their jobs, trying to finish their homework, study for exams, and learn the skills they need to succeed as workers and citizens. All they are asking is that we do our jobs and commit to providing every person in America with the opportunity to live a decent life.
Despite these daunting statistics, many politicians in Washington choose to focus their efforts and policies on affluent people with ready access to our political system, while mostly ignoring people living in poverty.
When I was a school superintendent, I often used to ask, ""Why is Washington so mean to our kids?"" When I arrived in the Senate, it became immediately clear that there was no place further from our classrooms.
People who are struggling to make ends meet financially do not have the time or financial means to travel to Washington, hire a lobbyist, or make large political donations. They face barriers to voting that lead to lower rates of turnout in elections, especially in states that are actively seeking to disenfranchise low-income voters and people of color. They need leaders who are putting the interests of the next generation first because it is the right thing to do, not because there is a political incentive or reward on the other end.
Here is the good news: It is within our power to move tens of millions of Americans out of poverty and into the middle class, if we simply make the effort.
We can reap the massive rewards of a society that truly provides opportunity to every one of its citizens. Anti-poverty policies work. Without Social Security and Medicare, senior poverty rates would be much, much higher. Social Security alone lifts 27 million Americans, mostly seniors, out of poverty. Tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit lift another 9 million Americans out of poverty. Other programs such as housing support, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) lift millions more above or closer to the poverty line.
As president I will lead the country to:

Cut child poverty in half by the end of my first year in office;
Cut adult poverty in half by the end of my first term;
Eliminate homelessness by the end of my second term; and
Put America on the path to completely eliminate poverty within a generation.

This will require the most ambitious effort to fight poverty since the Great Society, and I will use every authority available to me as president. We will succeed by enlisting every level of government and every sector of our economy—nonprofits, philanthropy, advocacy groups, schools, health institutions, service providers, and businesses—in a coordinated national effort. Unlike my primary opponents in this race, I will show how I can pay for every dollar of this plan without unclear numbers or unrealistic projections.
For too long, we have allowed a narrative to persist in America that if people's lives are made miserable enough—if we just attach enough red tape, paperwork, and work requirements to health care or nutrition assistance—they will be motivated to work. The truth is that Americans who are able to work are highly motivated to work. We have just made it too hard for people to work, due to factors like the high costs of child care and transportation, and too hard for families in poverty to move to neighborhoods near good jobs and good schools. That's why my plan is built around creating opportunity and rewarding the dignity of work, rather than repeating efforts to punish the poor that we have seen fail time and again.
As president, I will lead from the White House with one central question in mind: Will this help or hurt the next generation? My administration will put the issue of fighting poverty—especially child poverty—front and center. That is how we will make our country stronger, and that is what we owe the next generation.

FULL PLAN
IMMEDIATELY INCREASE ECONOMIC SECURITYWe can take immediate and consequential steps to fight poverty and improve economic security for tens of millions of Americans. To do that, the Bennet Administration will:

Expand the Child Tax Credit through the American Family Act, which will provide a tax credit of up to $300 per month per child to help middle-class families afford to raise kids and immediately cut child poverty by nearly 40 percent.
Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to up to $3,000 per worker without children, growing the paychecks of tens of millions of Americans.
Raise the minimum wage to $15 or more in high-cost cities.
Enact paid family and medical leave so workers receive 70 percent of their monthly wages for up to 12 weeks when they take time to care for a newborn, address a serious health condition, or take care of an ailing family member.

INVEST IN EDUCATION, SKILLS, AND JOB CREATION FOR LOW-INCOME WORKERSThe Bennet Administration will make major investments in job creation, education, and skills development to lift Americans out of poverty, including:

Implement universal, high-quality preschool for all three- and four-year-olds in partnership with state and local governments.
Make our K-12 education system an engine of upward mobility rather than an accelerant of inequality. We will make a commitment that by 2028, our education system will ensure students arrive at Kindergarten ready to learn; can read by grade 3; are proficient in math and reading by grade 8; can think critically and solve problems; graduate high school with the ability to earn a living wage, not just the minimum wage; enter post-secondary education—if that's the path they choose—prepared to learn without remediation and to persist to an on-time graduation; and enter adulthood ready to participate in their democracy as informed citizens.
Invest $500 billion over 10 years to provide the skills needed for the nearly 70 percent of Americans without a four-year college degree to advance in the 21st century economy and earn a living wage, not just the minimum wage. This investment would support states that develop subsidized employment opportunities, such as the successful efforts in the Recovery Act through the TANF emergency fund, with funding to reimburse employers for up to 100 percent of the first six months of wages, with an additional retention bonus of up to $6,000 for employers who retain workers for two years. These programs would target the long-term unemployed; people eligible for public assistance; and the formerly incarcerated, among others.
Provide debt-free college, including tuition, fees, and room and board, for every low- and moderate-income student. We will make major federal investments alongside state governments to make a four-year public college degree debt free for families with incomes below $75,000 per year.
Create jobs and make major investments to combat climate change and upgrade our infrastructure. We will drive $10 trillion in job-creating public-private investment to combat climate change, creating millions of good-paying American jobs. We also will enact a $1 trillion investment to upgrade America's infrastructure, including our roads, bridges, airports, mass transit, and water infrastructure, and connect every community in America to high-speed, modern broadband internet.

STRENGTHEN OUR SAFETY NETWhen the economy deteriorates, the people hit hardest are those who are already struggling. We need to make more of the response to a recession automatic and have those automatic responses occur quickly to avert the damage to workers and families, consistent with the recent recommendations put forward by a group of economic experts. We also need to update our safety net programs more generally, even outside of the context of a recession. Finally, we must reverse the harmful policies put in place by the Trump Administration to kick millions of people off of Medicaid, SNAP, and other programs that support vulnerable Americans. The Bennet Administration will:

Automatically issue direct payments to individuals when the unemployment rate rises significantly above its lows over the previous year and an additional payment if unemployment rises even further. These payments will be structured to initially scale to about 0.8 percent of GDP, with an equal payment per adult and per dependent child. They will decline as the economy returns to health.
Automatically ramp up state fiscal support when the economy weakens, through a larger federal share of funding for Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), education, and firefighters and police officers on the job during downturns.
Reform unemployment insurance to automatically increase the federal share of support to states when state unemployment rates rise, increase unemployment benefit amounts in severe downturns, and extend the duration of unemployment insurance to up to 99 weeks in the most severe recessions. The Bennet Administration will also update the regular unemployment compensation (UC) program to expand eligibility and improve the minimum level of benefits.
Automatically increase other safety net programs in a downturn by expanding SNAP benefits by up to 15 percent during recessions. We also will eliminate work requirements on SNAP, Medicaid, and other programs that are designed as administrative hurdles to kick people off of these programs, many of whom are working but lose critical support because of paperwork or other barriers.
Reverse the Trump Administration's damaging attack on Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE), which is designed to intentionally throw three million Americans off of SNAP.

TACKLE THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISISOur nation faces a shortage of more than 7.2 million affordable homes available to low-income renters. Nearly 40 million middle- and lower-income households are ""cost-burdened,"" spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent or a mortgage, including 18 million households that pay more than half of their income on housing. We must overhaul our federal housing policy so that every American can afford a stable home in a thriving community. The Bennet Administration will:

Fully eliminate the 7.2 million unit national shortage of affordable housing for low-income renters. We will directly support the building and refurbishment of 4 million affordable units through the Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and USDA's rural housing programs. We also will induce state and local leaders to break down barriers to affordable housing near good jobs and good schools by addressing the crucial link between housing and transportation. The Bennet Administration will require that competitive federal transportation investments go to communities that promote inclusive, affordable housing supply, including those that are measurably increasing affordable housing supply near existing transit hubs. We will triple the funding for competitive and innovative transportation funding through the BUILD (formerly TIGER) program—increasing annual funding to $4.5 billion—and strengthen the requirements for communities to develop in an inclusionary manner.
Combat exclusionary housing policy that stifles opportunity and segregates communities. We will create a one-time $10 billion competitive grant program for local governments, councils of governments, or state governments that reduce barriers restricting affordable housing in high-opportunity areas and increase the number of affordable units. These grants will be designed to ensure that a greater share of residents have access to the benefits of a growing economy.
Fully fund housing vouchers. Only one out of every four Americans who qualify receive a voucher, and the three out of four denied assistance face severe cost burdens. The Bennet Administration will dramatically increase the number of vouchers to fully meet the need over 15 years, including for the VASH program, which helps veterans. We will also increase the flexibility and effectiveness of the voucher program to help people live in a stable environment and better connect them with good job opportunities and good schools for their kids.
End homelessness by 2028 by expanding housing for people experiencing homelessness and increasing supportive services. We will create a $7.5 billion per-year grant program for states, local governments, and nonprofits to develop and expand innovative, community-based programs for people who are homeless. These programs will pair housing provision with supportive services, including mental and physical health, addiction treatment, high-quality job training, and financial literacy.

COVER EVERY AMERICAN WITH HIGH-QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCEA family should never have to go bankrupt due to a medical expense, split prescription pills in half, or make decisions between paying the bills or paying for medicine. The Bennet Administration will:

Lower healthcare costs, cut prescription drug prices, and cover every American with high-quality, affordable health insurance. We will do this by implementing Medicare-X, a public option that gives people the choice of buying into a more affordable government plan. This will lower the cost of insurance for families who increase their earnings above Medicaid eligibility, which acts as a hidden tax on people pulling themselves out of poverty. Medicare-X will require the federal government, for the first time in history, to negotiate for lower drug prices. We also will automatically enroll all eligible Americans in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Buttigieg Campaign Press Release - Buttigieg Campaign Announces Fundraisers Will Be Open and Names of People Raising Money Will Be Made Public,2019-12-09T00:00:00+00:00,Pete Buttigieg,/documents/buttigieg-campaign-press-release-buttigieg-campaign-announces-fundraisers-will-be-open-and,"
South Bend, IN –– Today, Mike Schmuhl, campaign manager for Pete for America, released the following statement:
""In a continued commitment to transparency, we are announcing today that our campaign will open fundraisers to reporters, and will release the names of people raising money for our campaign. Fundraising events with Pete will be open to press beginning tomorrow, and a list of people raising money for the campaign will be released within the week.
""From the start, Pete has said it is important for every candidate to be open and honest, and his actions have reflected that commitment. He is the only current presidential candidate who has released the names of people raising money for his campaign, and we will continue to release additional names as more people join our growing effort. Moreover, he will be one of the few candidates to allow reporters access to his fundraising events.
""Our campaign strives to be the most transparent in the field. Pete has held three multi-day bus tours with reporters that were completely on the record, has previously released the names of people who have fundraised for our campaign, and made public 12 years of tax returns, which includes all of the mayor's professional working life since he finished his education. Pete has also committed to restoring press briefings in the White House.
""No other candidate for president has released the entirety of their tax returns since their education concluded. No other current candidate for president has released the names of people raising money for their campaign. There are important differences in this race among Democratic candidates, from creating a choice of affordable health care choices for all to removing cost as a barrier to college for those who need it, but transparency shouldn't be one of them.
""We plan to continue to talk about the issues that matter most to voters, because Pete is more interested in bringing people together to solve the critical issues facing America. This election is about defeating Donald Trump and uniting the country the day after this president leaves office. Pete is the best candidate to beat Trump, and we remain focused on doing just that in 2020.""

""This report confirms significant misconduct and wrongdoing by the Obama-Biden FBI. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid for foreign sources to manufacture fake dirt on President Trump and his campaign, resulting in the now-debunked Steele Dossier.

Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa Introduces Mike Bloomberg at Texas State Democratic Executive Committee Meeting,2019-12-07T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/bloomberg-campaign-press-release-chairman-gilberto-hinojosa-introduces-mike-bloomberg,"
""Today, I'm going to introduce a man who knows how important Texas is for 2020, Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
""Mayor Bloomberg has been on the front lines of turning Texas blue for years and is helping us turn Texas into the biggest battleground state in the country. I invited him to address you because, simply put, Mayor Bloomberg puts his money where his mouth is. And he also gets it. This man gets it.
""When I was kid working, and we would go working in the field with my grandfather, and we would go work in the city, the best pickers wouldn't pick the smallest tree that was closer to the ground. The best pickers, the ones that made the most money, were the ones that picked the citrus trees, that was the largest, that had the most fruit in it. Right? He understands how that works. He understands that all the fruit, most of the fruit, is here in Texas.
""Texas is the biggest battleground state in the country. Democratic influence is on the rise in Texas, and that influence can be felt in every corner of our state. We've seen a record number of strong, diverse democratic candidates proud to run for office. At the presidential level, Donald Trump has been trailing or tied with the top democratic contenders for president in Texas in the last seven polls in a row.
""John Cornyn, the absent Senator in Texas, hasn't seen a poll above 37% approval rating since March. Most of them have come out in the 20s. Our Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have made a Texas a tier one priority, and we're only nine seats away from flipping the Texas House – many of which were in the DFW area.
""To win the state, it's going to take time and investment. Mayor Bloomberg's investment isn't just words. Just last month, Mayor Bloomberg announced that he would be investing in a voter registration drive that will boost voter turnout among many underrepresented communities in Texas. He understands how critical Texas is, and he's not just talking about it, he's putting in the work so Democrats can take back the state next November.
""By investing in our state and protecting and expanding the vote, Mayor Bloomberg is putting a stop to the Republican voter suppression efforts that have kept them in power.
""Before announcing his presidential bid, Mayor Bloomberg invested heavily in gun safety reform initiatives through his group Everytown For Gun Safety. And that means a lot to us in Texas after what happened recently in this state – in El Paso, in Odessa, in other parts of the state where you've seen mass shootings. Situations that never should have happened.
""This week, Mayor Bloomberg vowed that as president, he would close the private sale loophole and enforce stronger background checks and permanent requirements. As you know, there had been three mass shootings in Texas in the past year. The pain our communities have suffered continues to be met with Republican inaction. We applaud Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to stop the gun violence epidemic before more lives are lost and more Texas blood is shed.
""Mayor Bloomberg has also invested in climate change initiatives, that aim to close coal fired power plants and halt the growth of natural gas. Rather than relying upon fear mongering and fake science, Mayor Bloomberg knows what will curb the effects of climate change. Here in Texas, we saw the devastating firsthand effects of Hurricane Harvey.
""Just as he is on other issues, Mayor Bloomberg isn't just talking about change. He's doing it. It's investments like these that matter.
""Let me tell you something. This is our moment. We're going to win the White House, take out John Cornyn, flip several Congressional seats, break the super majority in the Texas Senate, flip the Texas House, and win hundreds of local elections across the state, because of this investment we're seeing in partners like Mayor Bloomberg and the time and energy shown by every single person in this room today.
""Although Mayor Bloomberg won't be the only presidential candidate to invest in the biggest battleground state in the country, we're enormously grateful for his generous contributions to Texas, and we look forward to partnering with him on issues and initiatives.
""With that said, it is my great honor to introduce to you the former mayor of the great city of New York, and one of the many great democratic candidates for president, Mayor Michael Bloomberg.""

Remarks at the Texas State Democratic Executive Committee Meeting in Plano,2019-12-07T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/remarks-the-texas-state-democratic-executive-committee-meeting-plano,"
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to be here today.
Hello, everyone! It's great to be in the great state of Texas! I'm told that Plano is actually home to great pizza. They didn't mention fruit, they just mentioned pizza. I'll have to taste it to believe it. Thin crust, burnt, and pepperoni and I'll pick it up on the way out. Thank you.
There are lots of reasons to love Texas – including Willie Nelson, who I once met in New York City. We had a nice chat, but for the record, I did not go inside his tour bus.
Now, I know they say everything in Texas is bigger than any place else, but I will just note that the Republican share of the vote here keeps shrinking – and all of you deserve a lot credit for that so give yourselves a round of applause.
In 2020, we have a chance to make history by turning Texas blue, and turning the page on this era of nasty division and utter incompetence that President Trump has saddled the country with.
But let me start by addressing the real elephant in the room. I realize that some people may say: Do we really want a general election between two New York billionaires? To which I say, who's the other one?!
If ever there was someone who is all hat and no cattle, it's Donald Trump.
Now it's true: I'm a New Yorker. But that's the only thing I have in common with President Trump. I didn't inherit my money. My father never made more than $6,000 a year, in the best year of his life. I went and started a company from scratch. Trump's father gave him a million bucks to get going. I'm not sure my father could count that high – much less have the money. I didn't play a CEO on reality TV. I actually worked as one! And I have to tell you, I look at the way he runs the White House and all I can think is, if he was running my company, he would've been fired the first month on the job! He doesn't know the first thing about what good management is!
I've also never filed for bankruptcy, not even once. He did it six times.
And I've never cheated my own charity out of money. Really, how unethical can you be? You just can't make this shit up. I shouldn't have said that. I told my staff I wouldn't say it that way.
Every year, I give away virtually all of my company's profits to address the big challenges we face, including education, and gun violence, and climate change. And unlike the president, I face facts and follow data that tell me the truth. That approach has always seriously served me well in business and government – and I know it can work in Washington, too. And that's really why I want to go to Washington. To see if I can make this country better for my kids, my grandkids, and you and your family.
The fact of the matter is, and here's where we get to the serious stuff, we cannot afford four more years of President Trump's reckless and unethical actions. He is a dangerous threat to our country, our values, and our national security. And I do believe that if he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.
That's why I'm running for president. Because we need to defeat Donald Trump and start uniting and rebuilding America. We cannot wait any longer.
Across this country, we are suffering from a lack of national leadership on all the big issues we face. For example, we have an economy that is tilted against most Americans. In Texas, the minimum wage is still $7.25, whereas in New York, we succeeded in raising it – and I'm glad to say that it's now $15 an hour, as it should be nationwide.
You've got to think about this for a little bit. It's really impossible to feed a family on $7.25, no less buy things to put under the Christmas tree.
We also have a health care system that costs too much and doesn't cover everyone – including almost one in five Texans who don't have insurance. You can't live this way. People have to be able to go to a doctor, find out what's wrong, and get cured.
We have an immigration system that is cruel and dysfunctional. And everyone here knows, walls aren't going to fix that.
We have a climate crisis that is growing worse every single day. Houston has had three 100-year floods in the last few years alone! If Noah were around today, he'd be building the biggest Ark in the history of the world! And we have a president who, when he hears these facts, just puts his head in the sand. We just can't live this way.
Over the course of this campaign, I'll tell you what I will do as president – and I want to emphasize the word ""do."" Because to me, leadership isn't about making big promises or shaking your fist at the world. It's about bringing people together and getting things done. Let me just give you a few quick examples of things I know we can do.
I know we can create safer communities and reduce incarceration across America. Why do I know that? Because we did it in New York! We cut crime by 32 percent, we cut murders by half, and we reduced incarceration by 39 percent, even while it went up in the rest of the country.
I know we can fix schools across America. Why? Because we did it in New York! We raised graduation rates by 42 percent, raised teacher salaries by 43 percent, and we turned around a broken school system that had been failing students for generations.
I know we can fight poverty and create good jobs across America. Why do I know that? Because we did it in New York! We created 400,000 new jobs, and New York was the only large U.S. city where poverty didn't increase during my 12 years in office.
I know we can make progress on climate change across America. Why? Because we did it in New York! We cut the city's carbon footprint by nearly 14 percent, which was twice the rate of the rest of the country.
Of course, we didn't do everything perfectly – or solve every problem. But we came a long way.
When I was first elected mayor, we were still recovering from the tragedy of 9/11. By the time I left office, New York was stronger than it had ever been.
Now, I've spent some time here in the Great State of Texas over the years. My first job out of school, I came here every two weeks to service the Republic National Bank of Dallas, Texas. I was going to outlive the bank. My company has offices in Houston and Dallas, and last year I had the honor of giving the commencement speech at Rice University – one of the great universities in the country.
But as great as Texas is – and it is great – this is also a state where you can still be fired, or barred from adopting a child, because of who you love.
It's a state where votes are suppressed, where families are separated and immigrant children are locked in cages. And where America's epidemic of gun violence can be seen on the streets of every city, in Wal-Marts, and even in churches. We have to right those wrongs – and if I'm lucky enough to be president, I promise you I will.
In addition to doing business in Texas, I've been active politically here, too. I've worked with, and my foundation has supported, a variety of mayors across the state, including Castro, who was a great Mayor of San Antonio.
I was also glad to support Lizzie Fletcher and Colin Allred in their campaigns for Congress. They were among the 21 House candidates I supported and worked to elect – which flipped the House to Democrats – giving this country at least some of the oversight of the president that the founding fathers had designed into the Constitution. And I also want to congratulate all of you for flipping 12 state house seats, and two state senate seats. All those campaigns have led to a Republican exodus from Congress that is so big it had to be called a TEX-odus.
Plus, even though he didn't win, Beto O'Rourke showed that a Democrat can win statewide in Texas. And from what I hear, Republican leaders in Texas are scared stiff that we will nominate a candidate who can rally Democrats and win over independents and disaffected Republicans – and that's what I've been doing my whole career.
The way I see it, Texas is the biggest battleground state, and I'm going to fight like hell to win its 38 electoral votes.
If I'm the nominee, I'll be investing in a statewide campaign that will support candidates up and down the ballot, so we not only send a Democrat to the White House – but we also send a Democrat to the U.S. Senate and win the Texas house, too!
While all the other candidates are focused on other states, President Trump is campaigning right here in Texas – and in other battleground states around the country. We cannot afford to ignore swing states until Super Tuesday – and I'm not going to do that. Not by a long shot.
I'm going to campaign in every one of the swing states. I'm running digital advertising against President Trump in them right now. And I'm also funding efforts to register voters in states like Texas – so every voice is heard at the ballot box.
And while I will not take a penny from any donors or special interests, you can rest assured I will not spare a penny to defeat President Trump here in Texas, and help elect Democrats statewide next November.
Now, I know you say, 'I feel like these people promise and don't do.' But let me tell you, I know I can beat the president – because I've already done it!
I've taken on him and the NRA over gun violence – and won. The organization I co-founded, Everytown for Gun Safety, has won stronger gun laws in states across the country.
I've taken on him and the biggest polluters over climate change, and I've led an effort that has closed more than half the nation's dirty coal plants.
I've also taken on him and the tobacco industry over e-cigarette use by children. And we are now winning battles at the state and local level.
Throughout my life, I've taken on the biggest opponents and the toughest fights. Beating Donald Trump and getting our country back on track is the fight of our lives – and together, we can make Texas the knockout punch.
Let me just close by saying that as a child and a Boy Scout, I was taught to believe in the promise and potential of America, and in the openness of the American Dream.
America is at its best when we work together to find meaningful and lasting solutions to the big challenges we face. I'm tired of this country being where we don't talk to each other – and where the president just divides us. The president, once he or she gets elected, is not supposed to be the head of the party, but the head of the whole country. We have got to stop pulling people apart and start bringing this country together – and that's what I promise I'll do.
In the months ahead, I'll announce my plans to address all the big issues facing the country. But more than plans, what I offer is the leadership to turn plans into reality. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and motivate people to come together – so we can rebuild America, and make it fairer and better.
I know how to do that. That's what I've done all my life. Pulling people together, focusing them, making sure they work together and deliver results for the people that they're supposed to serve.
I'm ready to get working. I know you are, too, and I hope to be your partner in turning Texas blue – once and for all – in 2020.
Thank you, and God bless.

Sanders Campaign Press Release - New Hampshire American Postal Workers Union Endorses Bernie Sanders for President,2019-12-06T00:00:00+00:00,Bernie Sanders,/documents/sanders-campaign-press-release-new-hampshire-american-postal-workers-union-endorses-bernie,"
WASHINGTON – The statewide organization of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) today endorsed Bernie Sanders for President following a unanimous vote by the union's board.

""Bernie Sanders has demonstrated a vast understanding of the issues that impact postal workers,"" said New Hampshire APWU Legislative Director, Janice Kelble. ""Throughout his entire career, he has fought to maintain Public Postal Services and advocated for the enhancement of postal services, both as a member of the House of Representatives and as a member of the United States Senate. He not only votes the right way on legislation, but he has introduced meaningful legislation to achieve much needed postal reform.""
""We are extremely pleased to support the candidate who has always stood with workers"", added statewide President of New Hampshire APWU Dana Coletti
This endorsement from the NH APWU is demonstrative of Bernie's strong relationship with labor. The APWU endorsement closely follows those from other major labor groups including from the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA), National Nurses United (NNU), Boston Independent Drivers Guild (BIDG), United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE), and National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW).
Sanders is a strong, unwavering advocate for unions across all sectors. Sanders has the most thorough and extensive plan of any presidential hopeful to strengthen the rights of American workers and the labor movement, laid out in his Workplace Democracy Plan.

Sanders Campaign Press Release - Bernie Sanders Releases High-Speed Internet for All Plan,2019-12-06T00:00:00+00:00,Bernie Sanders,/documents/sanders-campaign-press-release-bernie-sanders-releases-high-speed-internet-for-all-plan,"
WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday unveiled a groundbreaking plan, ""High-Speed Internet for All,"" to invest $150 billion to provide high-speed internet access to every household in America, dramatically lower the costs of high-speed internet services, and break up and regulate internet monopolies. The plan would require providers to offer a basic, quality internet plan at an affordable price.
""It is outrageous that across the country millions of Americans and so many of our communities do not have access to affordable high-speed internet,"" said Sanders. ""Access to the internet is a necessity in today's economy, and it should be available for all. We are going to take on the greedy internet, telecom, and cable monopolies and put an end to their absurd prices gauging. Just as President Roosevelt fundamentally made America more equal by bringing electricity to every farm and rural community over 80 years ago, as president, I will do the same with high-speed internet.""
Having high-speed internet is central to the basic functions of families, students, and businesses, yet across the country huge swaths of the population lack access to an internet connection or cannot afford the options available.
As President, Sanders will stop the practice of treating high-speed internet access like a luxury item, and instead treat it like a public utility that everyone deserves as a basic human right. Sanders will also take on the greed of the telecom and cable monopolies who exploit their dominant market power to rip off consumers and lobby government at all levels to keep out competition. Ending this type of greed and corruption will be a major priority under a Sanders administration.
Bernie's plan would:

Provide $150 billion through the Green New Deal in infrastructure grants and technical assistance for municipalities and/or states to build publicly owned and democratically controlled, co-operative, or open access broadband networks.
Require that all internet service providers offer a Basic Internet Plan that provides quality broadband speeds at an affordable price.
Break up internet service provider and cable monopolies, bar service providers from providing content, and unwind anticompetitive mergers.
Increase the FCC definition of minimum broadband speeds to 100mbps for downloads and 10mbps for uploads.
Set aside $7.5 billion to expand high-speed broadband in Indian Country and fully resource the FCC's Office of Native Affairs and Policy.
Ensure people with disabilities have full access to the internet.
Guarantee all public housing residents free broadband services.
Ensure broadband infrastructure is resilient to the effects of climate change.

Mayor Hardie Davis, Jr. and Bloomberg met in Augusta Today
AUGUSTA, GA. – Today, Mayors for Mike announced that the mayors of Augusta, Georgia; Gary, Indiana; Tacoma, Washington and Huntington, West Virginia all are endorsing Mike Bloomberg for President, reflecting a range of communities across the country. Bloomberg's national campaign seeks to reach Americans in states not frequently visited by other Democratic candidates.
Mayor Hardie Davis, Jr. of Augusta, Georgia: ""The tone in Washington is toxic and it's spreading across the country. Mike Bloomberg is a refreshing leader, a unifier, who understands that we have more in common than what divides us. Mike Bloomberg is a leader who is not afraid of tough issues and challenging conversations. He creates coalitions and builds bridges to establish lasting, common-sense solutions that work. That's what we need in local, state and federal government. We need a strong, proven leader in the White House and that's why Mike has my support.""
Bloomberg met with Mayor Davis today in Augusta and toured The Lucy Craft Laney Museum of Black History. Mayor Davis' leadership has been recognized by peer mayors across the country. He is President of the African American Mayors Association and serves as a Trustee of the U. S. Conference of Mayors.
Mayor Victoria Woodards of Tacoma, Washington: ""I proudly endorse Mike Bloomberg based on his experience leading America's largest city and his commitment to strengthening our nation and all its communities. That's the kind of leader our country needs more than ever.""
Woodards has demonstrated a lifelong track record of public service. She served as president of the Tacoma Urban League and as director of community development for the Tacoma Rainiers. Her past civic engagement work has also included leadership positions with the Tacoma Metropolitan Parks Board, the Washington State History Museum, and the Washington State Commission of African American Affairs.
Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson of Gary, Indiana: ""I am pleased to add my voice to the people who understand how good Mike Bloomberg's leadership would be for our country. His experience in business and government and practical approach to problem-solving has been immensely helpful in communities like Gary and would translate well in cities, towns and villages across the country. Mike's track record of addressing economic development, gun violence, climate change and public health has benefited many Americans and make him a logical choice for President.""
Freeman-Wilson has served as the mayor of her hometown Gary, Indiana, since 2012 when she became the first woman to lead the city of Gary and the first African-American woman mayor in the state of Indiana. Prior to her role as mayor, Freeman-Wilson served as the Indiana Attorney General, the Director of the Indiana Civil Rights Commission and the presiding judge of the Gary City Court. Freeman-Wilson just completed her term as the President of the National League of Cities.
Mayor Steve Williams of Huntington, West Virginia: ""I have experienced first hand and the residents of my city have witnessed directly the effect of the leadership of Mayor Bloomberg. We have been able to implement innovative solutions to improve the quality of life of our citizens because of Mayor Bloomberg's support and guidance. I have been proud to work with the Mayor and his organization to set standards that the rest of the nation will be able to emulate.""
Williams' career in public service began with leading the city's economic development department, and not long after, he was named the youngest city manager in Huntington's history. He has also served in the West Virginia House of Delegates, where he spent much of his time working to reform the higher education and medical education systems in West Virginia.

Booker Campaign Press Release - Youngest Woman Serving in New Hampshire Legislature Endorses Cory Booker for President,2019-12-06T00:00:00+00:00,Cory Booker,/documents/booker-campaign-press-release-youngest-woman-serving-new-hampshire-legislature-endorses,"
Leading Advocate for Ending Child Marriage and NH State Rep. Cassie Levesque is 103rd New Hampshire Endorsement for Booker
Manchester, NH — New Hampshire State Representative Cassie Levesque (Barrington) -- the youngest woman serving in the New Hampshire legislature and a leading advocate for ending child marriage -- today announced she is endorsing Cory Booker for president. Earlier this week, Booker announced that he's earned 100 endorsements from Granite State leaders -- more than any other 2020 candidate. That total now climbs to 103 -- and includes 20 New Hampshire state representatives -- after Levesque and State Reps. Garrett Muscatel (Hanover) and Rosemarie Rung (Merrimack) announced their support in the last two days.
""I've seen almost every candidate in-person, but Cory Booker stands above them all. Cory is a leader who will listen to my generation and fight for justice for everyone,"" said State Rep. Cassie Levesque. ""Cory will bring experience and a track record of results to the Oval Office, as well as unmatched empathy for others. I'm excited to endorse Cory for president because he will heal our country and bring a much-needed urgency to solving the big challenges we face.""
Levesque, a Southern New Hampshire University student, was elected in 2018 at the age of 19 and represents Strafford County District 4. Her victory in 2018 was part of a wave of young Democrats winning legislative seats last year.
Levesque first learned about the workings of the legislature five years ago when she began advocating for lawmakers to raise the legal marriage age from 13 to 18. The issue resonated with Levesque, as her grandmother and great-grandmother left abusive households and entered into marriages as minors. After being dismissed in part because of her age, she decided to run for her local state representative seat on the Seacoast -- and she won. When the State did raise the legal age to 16 last year, Levesque was credited with being the driving force. And now she's working to raise the age to 18, this time as an elected official.
In addition to Levesque, Booker has earned the backing of three state senators, 19 additional state representatives, the state's longest-serving mayor, and dozens of key activists across New Hampshire.

We need a strong, proven leader in the White House and that is why I support Mike Bloomberg.
""Not only do I support him, but when I think about his twelve year run as Mayor of our nation's largest City, an incredible body of work in philanthropy, supporting liberal causes from green energy to sustainability and the lives of human beings, I thank my friend, Mike Bloomberg, for the work that he has done and will do for these United States of America.
""At a time when the heart and soul of our country is being divided, we need a leader who has been touched by the better angels of our nature. Mike Bloomberg is that leader.

"Remarks in Augusta, Georgia",2019-12-06T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/remarks-augusta-georgia,"
Good afternoon everyone!
'Thank you, mister mayor, for your support – and your leadership here in Augusta. It's great to be here to talk to voters about some of the issues that matter most to them.
We went to a coffee shop where we took a lot of pictures – including, it turns out, with the mother of one of my security people. She's lived here forever and he's now a hero because he got his mother with this mayor (referring to Mayor Davis). Didn't seem to care about me – this mayor was the one that mattered.
'And it's great to see some of the work that the mayor is leading to put this city back on track for a bright future.
'Mayor Davis has done a great job, and as president of the African American Mayors Association, he's in a key position to help cities work together and spread good ideas, which is critically important.
Now, I know we both believe in the power of cities to drive change around the country. That's what mayors do. We've both been lucky enough to serve for a while and make a difference. We also both have degrees in electrical engineering – although I'm sure Mayor Davis got better grades than I did.
You went to Geogia Tech, is that right? I went to Johns Hopkins and I think Georgia Tech did have a better engineering school – I hope not today, but maybe back then. Let's just say, with my academic record, I was the kind of student who made the top half of the class possible. So I'm honored to have his support.
I'm running for president, as you know. When people say why, the answer is to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. I think the stakes could not be higher. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump's recklessness and unethical actions. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America – by investing right here at home, and restoring our nation's credibility and moral leadership abroad.
I've spent my career bringing people together and tackling big problems – and fixing them. It has worked well in business – and in running the country's largest, most progressive city. And I think it can work in Washington, as well.
One of my priorities as president will be supporting and empowering local leaders like Mayor Davis – because I've seen how effective local governments can be. Local governments are where you deliver the services. Local governments are where the people can get to talk to their leaders on the streets, every day.
And I'm happy that we made a big difference in New York City, just as Mayor Davis has made here. In New York City, we raised graduation rates, while I was mayor, by 42%. We cut murders in half while also cutting incarceration rates by 39%. And we cut carbon emissions by 14% while also creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs, and we expanded public health insurance.
I know we can make big progress on all of those issues nationally – because we did it in New York! Not just me, but the team I put together. And teamwork is the real key to making government efficient.
I know we can defeat Donald Trump – because we've already beaten him.
We've taken him on over gun violence – and won stronger gun laws in states across the country. We've taken him on over climate change — and we've led an effort that has closed more than half the nation's dirty coal-fired power plants. We've also taken him on over e-cigarette use by children, and we are now winning in cities and states across the country.
Georgia, as you know, is a critical, crucial battleground state in this election, but what you don't see is presidential candidates coming here very often. The fact is, President Trump is about the only one spending money here and in swing states around the country – and that's a big problem for our party.
Democrats have a great chance to win Georgia and turn it from red to blue for the first time in a generation if we nominate someone who makes winning here a top priority. And if we nominate someone who builds the kind of broad coalition that's needed to win in Georgia and other crucial swing states. That's what I'm working to do, and that's why I'm here.
We can win more than just the presidential election in Georgia. Georgia is the only state with two Senate seats up for grabs in November. Democrats can win both of those – and I'll do everything I can to make sure that happens.
I was glad to support Stacey Abrams' campaign last year – and to support her new effort to register voters in battleground states, including here in Georgia.
Governor Kemp's attempt to purge another 300,000 voters from Georgia's voting rolls has nothing to do with the integrity of the voting rolls, and everything to do with hurting Democrats, so we can't let that happen. We have to fight back, and if I'm the nominee, we'll have a fully funded effort to support Georgia Democrats up and down the ticket so we can flip the state from Red to Blue, just as we did in Virginia.
I supported, as you know, last year, 21 winning candidates in the midterms. One of them was Lucy McBath, who won Georgia's sixth Congressional district, outside of Atlanta. I got to know Lucy through an organization I helped to found, called Everytown for Gun Safety. For those who don't know Lucy's story, her son Jordan was shot and killed back in 2012, by someone who thought he was playing his music too loud. It was just one of those senseless tragedies that happen too often across this country. Lucy, rather than just sitting back, decided to make sure that other parents didn't have to experience what she did. So she decided to do something about it – and we need to elect more leaders like her to Congress.
Yesterday I was in Aurora, Colorado to speak with survivors of gun violence who are fighting for smarter gun laws. I outlined what I will do as president to end the scourge of gun violence – like strengthening background checks and other commonsense gun laws that keep guns out of dangerous hands.
In the weeks ahead, I'll outline my plans on other key issues – including creating good jobs and fighting climate change. But more than plans, what I offer is the leadership to turn plans into reality.
America is at its best when we work together to find meaningful and lasting solutions to the big challenges that we face. I'm tired of this country being a place where we don't talk to each other. I'm tired that the left doesn't talk to the right. I'm tired that Republicans don't talk to Democrats. The blue doesn't talk to the red. We have a President who is not supposed to be the head of the party, but the head of the whole country, and he just doesn't get that. We have got to stop pulling people apart and start bringing them together – and that's what I will do.
As a child and a Boy Scout, I was taught to believe in the promise and potential of America, and in the openness of American Dream. I still believe in that ideal, but I have never been more worried about our country's future.
And that's why I decided to run – after having said a while ago that I wasn't going to run. But when I took a took at what was happening, and things were getting worse, and I didn't see others that I thought could beat Donald Trump, I said shame on me if I didn't have the courage to stand up and at least try. And I'm going to try, and I'm going to win.
I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and motivate people to come together – so we can rebuild America, and make it fairer and better.
I'm ready to get working – and I'm honored to have Mayor Davis' support.
Thank you all very much. Mr. Mayor, I'm indebted to you. I think you made the right decision, but in any case, I'm happy, my daughters will be happy, and I hope a lot of people will be happy. Your endorsement really means something. You know what it takes to make this a better country and a better world, and I'm honored, so thank you again.

Bennet Campaign Press Release - New Hampshire Representative Marjorie Smith Endorses Michael Bennet for President,2019-12-05T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bennet,/documents/bennet-campaign-press-release-new-hampshire-representative-marjorie-smith-endorses-michael,"
MANCHESTER, NH — New Hampshire State Rep. Marjorie Smith today endorsed Michael Bennet for President of the United States. Smith has represented the Strafford 6 district since 2012; previously, she represented the district from 1996 to 2010. Smith chairs the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee.
""Michael Bennet first caught my attention when I learned that he left a powerful position in the private sector to enter public service, eventually heading up the Denver Public Schools because he believes that a democracy depends upon every child having access to the best possible public education,"" Smith said.
""Elected from a purple state, he has demonstrated that he appeals to a diverse group of voters. And he listens. He is going from community to community, talking about his vision to build opportunity for all, and listening to citizens talk about what's on their minds. He refuses to use the catchphrases of the day.
""If you want glitz, big money, and knee jerk responses, Bennet is not your man. I support Senator Bennet because I believe he is governed by a moral compass that can appeal to a majority of voters, and has demonstrated that he has the experience and the integrity to lead this nation.""
Smith has written forcefully about the importance of preserving the New Hampshire primary, including its tradition of living room conversations where candidates share their vision and answer questions before Granite Staters cast their ballots. She hosted a house party for Bennet in November.
Bennet returns to New Hampshire on Friday for a five-day tour of the state, which will include stops in Salem, Bedford, Concord, Andover, Lancaster, Conway, and other towns across the Granite State.
Bennet represents Colorado in the Senate, but he has not spent a lifetime in politics. He turned around failing businesses in the private sector and improved outcomes for kids as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. Bennet is the only candidate in this race who has won two national elections in a swing state. He has released comprehensive, field-leading proposals to provide high-quality, affordable health care with a public option, reward hard work, fix our broken political system, and tackle climate change by working with our farmers and ranchers.

Biden Campaign Press Release - Former Secretary of State John Kerry Endorses Joe Biden for President,2019-12-05T00:00:00+00:00,Joseph R. Biden,/documents/biden-campaign-press-release-former-secretary-state-john-kerry-endorses-joe-biden-for,"
John Kerry, former Secretary of State, 2004 Democratic nominee for President, and five-term Senator representing Massachusetts, today released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
""I believe Joe Biden is the President our country desperately needs right now, not because I've known Joe so long, but because I know Joe so well. I've never before seen the world more in need of someone who on day one can begin the incredibly hard work of putting back together the world Donald Trump has smashed apart. There's never been a time more urgent for leadership at home that can work for the middle class and tackle existential issues like climate change where we are moving dangerously backwards. Joe is uniquely the person running for president who can beat Donald Trump and get to work on day one at home and in the world with no time to waste.
""I don't endorse lightly. Joe and I both got into public service to make our country fairer for people and make the world safer. I've watched Joe do exactly that as a senator, statesman, and vice president. We served 24 years together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When Chairman Biden became Vice President Biden, he didn't just hand me a gavel, but a legacy of getting things done with integrity and bipartisanship, and shared experiences on hundreds of thousands of miles traveled together building relationships around the world. He was a partner working to pass the NEW START Treaty that made us safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation. Four years when I later became Secretary of State, Joe was an advocate and an ally on the hardest issues, from diplomacy to end the Iranian nuclear threat that Donald Trump's let back out of the bottle, to building the military and diplomatic strategy that beat back ISIL and ultimately routed them from the territory they once held.
""Through it all, I've seen Joe tested in public service and tested in life itself. I know his character. I know the measure of a person who never stopped fighting for millions of Americans even as his beloved son was losing a heartbreaking battle with cancer. Joe's strength and his moral center are inspiring. But so are his skills as a leader. As a Senator, he stood up to war criminals in the Balkans, pushed arms control agreements through the Senate, and wrote one of the chamber's first-ever climate bills. I've seen him triumph – passing the landmark Violence Against Women Act, and beating the NRA to win an assault weapons ban. I saw him up close working to find the key votes needed to pass Obamacare and give us the biggest health care reform in history, doing what had eluded every president since Harry Truman. I've seen him consistently trusted as the President's point-person on everything from the Recovery Act that saved us from a second Great Depression, to addressing the crisis of unaccompanied minors and irregular migration from Central America in 2014.
""Joe has never shied away from a challenge. He has never lost his heart, his middle class Scranton values, his honor, his resilience, or his belief in putting country above all else.
""Joe will defeat Donald Trump next November. He's the candidate with the wisdom and standing to fix what Trump has broken, to restore our place in the world, and improve the lives of working people here at home.""
Secretary Kerry will join Joe Biden on the ""No Malarkey"" barnstorm on Friday, December 6 starting in Cedar Rapids, IA. Kerry will also travel to New Hampshire with Joe Biden on Sunday, December 8. Additional logistical details will be forthcoming. In 2004, Secretary Kerry won both the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary.
To date, Biden for President has earned more than 775 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, national security officials, and community leaders — a sign of Biden's growing momentum in the nominating race. Secretary Kerry is the fourth former Obama-Biden cabinet member to endorse Biden. His support comes a few weeks after more than 130 national security and foreign policy professionals endorsed Biden as the best candidate to restore our global leadership.

Endorsements Announced Ahead of Sanders Events with Farmers and Rural Leaders on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
DES MOINES -- A group of 38 Iowa farmers and rural activists on Thursday endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. The endorsements come as Sanders is set to speak tonight at the Organic Farmers Association and Iowa Organic Association Forum in Story City, the Iowa Farmers Union Presidential Forum on Friday in Grinnell and his Farmer and Rural Economy Town Hall in Iowa Falls on Saturday.
""Rural agriculture is the victim of corporations at both ends of the spectrum,"" Delaware County farmer Randy Marquardt said. ""After 49 years I am considering an exit, not due to health or wanting to retire but rather a desire to do something whereby I can actually make a living. I know Bernie Sanders will fight for families like mine, because he always has.""
""Our grassroots movement is earning the support of rural Iowans because we are the only campaign with the vision, courage, and the people power required to save small-town America from corporate greed,"" Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik said. ""These Iowans are tired of watching corporations swallowing up their farms and local economies. They understand that Bernie Sanders is the candidate they can trust to take on these predatory monopolies, and win.""
Sen. Sanders' Revitalizing Rural America plan and his Green New Deal would boost rural economies, mitigate water pollution and promote sustainable farming practices across the country. Sanders will also use antitrust authority to combat abusive corporate monopolies strangling family farms.

"Remarks on Gun Policy in Aurora, Colorado",2019-12-05T00:00:00+00:00,Michael Bloomberg,/documents/remarks-gun-policy-aurora-colorado,"
Tom, Pastor, thank you very much. I thought while I was just listening, maybe it would be appropriate just to take a pause for 30 seconds, 60 seconds and remember.
I didn't lose anybody so far in my family to gun violence and hopefully never will, but I certainly know a number of people who did. I think all I can do is try to work to make a better world so there will be fewer people and there'll be less need to have people with red shirts in common like this.
I was just looking and wondering how many red shirts I have at home. Probably about a dozen. I used to take one each time after each event, and then I said, 'Wait a second, that's not good use of the shirts.' But they're in my closet and I try to take the one every day when I run, I take the one from the bottom and I assume that when it gets washed it gets put on the top. So I cycle through all of them. So if I have one of your shirts, I do use it actually.
Anyway, it's an honor to speak with you today – and thank you all for being here, and particularly for braving the snow and the rain. I was warned wear a big jacket and have boots. So I brought a set of cowboy boots in my luggage, but I didn't take them out because they didn't have all the snow that you had promised me.
Tom and I just came from the memorial for the victims of the Aurora theater shooting, and I put some flowers down in the middle of the memorial which is where his son is remembered. And all of you have different places that you go to, but we all have the same thing in common, we've lost somebody. And we have to make sure that we build for the future so nobody else has to go through this.
I just can't imagine the pain that one has if you lose a child – it's just unthinkable. And yet you've gone through it and you have the strength and the courage, and some of you deal with it in one way and some of you deal with it another way.
But to see Tom – and so many other survivors – turning their grief into action really is inspiring. I think it's the main thing that you can do in memory of whoever you lost.
It takes incredible strength and courage, I know – and I just want to say how grateful I am for your leadership. You're making the world a better place, and hopefully we don't have to have that many more meetings like this one.
I've worked with Everytown for a long time, I've met survivors across the country, and the number of survivors is just staggering. Every day you pick up the paper today, and there's another shooting. Some are one, some are two, some are big ones.
This year in the United States, 12,000 people will be murdered with illegal handguns and 19,000 people will commit suicide with illegal handguns – 32,000, 33,000, some number along that line. It just has to stop.
No other developed country experiences losses in gun gun violence like we do here in America – not even close.
Thirty-five people a day are murdered with guns. But for decades, too many politicians just ignored the problem.
Now, the reason was partly the power of the NRA, but it was also partly because, let's face it, a lot of politicians view this as a black and Latino problem. And so they just looked the other way. To me it's just disgraceful what they do.
Just think about this, black men make up only six percent of the population – but they make up 52 percent of gun violence victims. More than half.
There's a number of things wrong in our society and we just have to do something about it. These murders usually don't usually make national headlines. But they are national tragedies – and we just can't accept them.
In recent years, more politicians have begun waking up because the killings are happening in their communities, and in their churches and in their malls and in their movie theaters.
Their constituents are losing children, and their voters are demanding action – and voters are electing candidates who are getting things done. If you don't want to be depressed, just think we really are making progress. But we have an enormously long way to do.
Getting things done is what Everytown for Gun Safety is all about. And that's what Tom and other leaders here in Aurora have done, and it's why I'm running for president – just to stop this nationwide madness. That's the only way to describe it.
I don't know, Tom, how you get up every day and remember Alex, but also have the courage to go out and try to make this world a better place. So thank you, and thank everybody here.
This issue is somewhat personal for me. As Tom mentioned, I've gone to an awful lot of eulogies, partially because of all the people killed on 9/11, but after that as 12 years as mayor, unfortunately one of the things you have to do is you have to go and comfort the families and you have to talk about somebody who's deceased that you never met and try to put yourself in the place of the parents. And that's just so hard to do.
Donald Trump accepts this violence and pain. And he and the NRA leaders say that there isn't anything we can do about it. And every time I go to another funeral, I think there has to be something we can do about it.
I don't accept that kids being murdered at school is something that we should be used to. I don't accept that kids getting killed in the streets is something we should get used to. I didn't accept gun violence ripping apart our cities and communities every day, and I am going to do everything I can to change the administration in Washington and fight back against this evil.
It's not the only problem this country has, but it's certainly one that we can focus on today.
When I started working on gun violence some 15 years ago, neither party, neither Republicans or the Democrats, were particularly interested in the issue. In fact, some Democrats voted against the Brady background check bill back in the 1990s, and some even voted to give blanket immunity to the gun industry – something no other industry in the United States has. That really was shameful – and as president, I will work to repeal it.
When I was mayor of New York City, I co-founded the national coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns that we talked about before. We enlisted more than 1,000 other mayors from red states and blue states. But even after Democrats won control of both Congress and the White House back in 2008, gun safety just was not a priority – and sadly when we had the opportunity to do something about it it just fell by the wayside.
When I left City Hall in 2014, I didn't walk away from the fight, though – I got even more involved because it seemed to me I had more time and why not devote my life to the same thing that I had when I was Mayor. I helped found Everytown and helped build it into a counterweight to the NRA.
Today, Everytown and Moms Demand Action have an army of six million supporters. Think about that, six million supporters – and they are shaking up politics across the country.
Since last year, 20 states have passed significant new gun laws, including nine signed by Republican governors. So if you just go and knock on the door in your red shirts or you write letters or you pick up the phone and you call, you are making a difference. Elected officials are responsive, they've just got to hear enough people say this is what I want, and this is the reason I'm going to vote for you or not vote for you. And you will get the action that you're demanding.
It took 19 members of Congress who were A-rated by the NRA for us to support candidates to run against them. The 19 were replaced by people who understood that we just cannot continue to kill our young people, and that we have to do something and that they are responsible.
The gun safety champions we helped elect flipped control of the House to Democrats.
I'm happy to say under Nancy Pelosi's leadership, one of the first things the new House did was to pass a strong background check bill. But unfortunately, we have a president who bows down to the extremists who run the NRA, and we cannot tolerate that.
I believe we need a president who has a track record of taking on the NRA, and winning. And you say, why do I think I can do it? Because I've done it.
So today, I just want to touch on a few of the actions that I've taken to do something about this national emergency, rather than just talk about it. I emphasize do something – because my candidacy is about getting things done.
There is just too much talk about gun violence. The movement that we created gets things done. I've given my time to organize and reorganize and pull together resources from local groups across the country, and defeat Republicans who stand in the way, and I can tell you I am just getting started no matter what happens in the next election.
For me, leadership isn't about shaking your fist at the world. Or putting ideas up on a website. It's about bringing people together, to solve problems, and get results. And that's what I want to do as president.
To begin with, if I'm lucky enough to get elected, we're going to overhaul the background check system to make it much more effective. No one should be able to buy a gun without passing a complete background check, and we're going to get that done.
We'll also close loopholes and gaps in the systems – like the one allowing un-married domestic abusers to possess guns, and the one allowing sales to go through if a background check takes longer than three business days, and the one preventing law enforcement from identifying felons and others who own guns illegally.
We'll also be smarter about who can buy guns. For instance, 18- to 20-year-olds are four times as likely to commit a homicide compared to older Americans.
The suicide rate among teens has increased exponentially over the past decade. And in most states, the legal age for purchasing a handgun from a private seller is still only 18.
Think about it, if you have to be 21 to buy a beer, you ought to be 21 at least to buy a hand-gun or any form of semi-automatic firearm.
We'll also work to adopt a 48-hour waiting period for every purchase that is really important in preventing suicides. And we'll adopt a red flag law at the federal level, like the one Tom helped pass right here in Colorado.
One of the biggest problems with the existing background check system has nothing to do with the database. It contains a lot of useful information about criminal history – but most of it can't be used to actually deny a purchase.
And we're going to change that – by requiring buyers to obtain a permit before they purchase a gun because just having a background check isn't enough. The question is, no matter what the background check says, can you stop them from getting a gun when they're a minor, when they have a criminal record, or when they have psychiatric problems.
This permit will allow authorities to screen applicants for dangerous behavior. And I just think about you and I and our conversation before about your son four months ago being shot and killed.
That includes arrests for violence, like assault and domestic violence incidents, or arrests for reckless behavior, like driving while intoxicated.
Now, I know critics will say that Americans shouldn't need a permit to exercise their constitutional rights. But voting is a constitutional right – and we require people to register, to protect the rights of all citizens. This is exactly the same idea, because a criminal with a gun can destroy our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Permits have worked very well in the 11 states that have adopted them, including New York I'm happy to say – and it's time to make the law of the land take that up.
As president, I will attack gun violence from every angle. I will work with Congress to reinstate the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to ban 3-D printing of guns, and to require firearms to be safely secured.
I'll work to give the Consumer Product Safety Commission the authority to adopt minimum gun safety standards. I'll declare gun violence to be a national public health emergency, which will increase the funding available for research. I'll also increase funding for the ATF to conduct enforcement – and for community-based violence intervention programs.
I'll ban guns at all public schools and colleges. I'll work with business leaders to encourage responsible sales practices – and pressure the gun industry to change. And I will do everything in my power to save lives.
Now, my agenda is not some Johnny-come-lately list of borrowed ideas. This is part of my life's work. And I'm just telling you, I will get this done whether I get elected or not.
I have proven in New York that gun safety laws can be passed and that they can be enforced. It takes focus, it takes facts, it takes determination. It takes never backing down.
I know Tom Sullivan isn't backing down. I know all of you are not backing down.
I promise you: I will never back down from this fight. That's the kind of president that this country needs and that you deserve.
Let's face it, it's going to be a very difficult time to reverse four years of cruelty and incompetence. The mind boggles at the thought of reversing eight years of it.
So number one priority is we have to make sure that Donald Trump is not re-elected.
And, number two, we have to stop pulling people apart.
We have to bring people together. We need a president who represents everybody – not one particular political party.
That's why I'm running – and that's the kind of president I will be.
We just have to do something about this, folks. We just cannot keep killing each other and killing our children, and killing our grandchildren, and killing our parents and loved ones and spouses. It's time to say enough is enough. We're just not going to put up with it anymore.
Thank you very much.
