Tallahassee, FL - Following a historic endorsement from Governor Kim Reynolds and a debate victory earlier this week, Ron DeSantis added 24 state-level endorsements in Iowa from 20 different counties, a testament to his growing momentum in the Hawkeye State.
DeSantis, who is back on the campaign trail in Iowa today, has the support of 41 current state legislators, as well as 120 county chairs across the state. He is the only candidate who is committed to completing the ""Full Grassley"" tour by visiting all 99 counties and has spent time in 88 so far.
""I know that Iowa's farmers and producers deserve a candidate that can fight our battles in Washington. The Republican Party needs a candidate that will bring the party together and win, and I believe Ron DeSantis is that person and that is why I have endorsed him,"" said Craig Hill, Past President of the Iowa Farm Bureau.
""He is a fit, mentally sharp, energetic candidate and would be eligible for a second term unlike President Donald Trump. The country is weary of the chaos that would mark another Trump term. In my opinion, DeSantis is the best Republican candidate to win the presidency. I hope my friends will support him in the Iowa caucuses as I will,"" said former Iowa Congressman Greg Ganske.

DeSantis Campaign Statement on Upcoming Debate with Gavin Newsom,2023-11-09T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-statement-upcoming-debate-with-gavin-newsom,"
November 30th has increased significance in light of Democrat effort to replace Biden
Tallahasee, FL - Following last night's victory, DeSantis for President campaign manager James Uthmeier issued a statement on Ron DeSantis' upcoming debate with Gavin Newsom in Georgia on November 30th.
""Ron DeSantis was victorious last night by making clear that he has what it takes to fight and win for the American people as commander-in-chief, but the next debate will be the biggest one yet,"" said campaign manager James Uthmeier. "" As Democrats ramp up their efforts to replace the historically unpopular and failed Joe Biden as their nominee, Ron DeSantis' showdown with Gavin Newsom is even more timely. A Newsom presidency would accelerate America's decline, and November 30th will be the first chance to expose to a national audience just how dangerous his radical ideology would be for the country. Ron DeSantis will take this responsibility seriously and looks forward to sharing the stark contrast between his vision to revive our nation and Newsom's blueprint for failure.""
BACKGROUND
When asked about the stakes of his debate with Gavin Newsom, Ron DeSantis said earlier this week:
""I think what California represents, it's kind of the leftist petri dish. So whatever the Democrats have already done in Washington, California is kind of like five years ahead of that. So if you did have a Biden second term, I think you'd get a lot of the same policies. But clearly, if you ended up with a Newsom, they would have policies that would really accelerate the decline of this country, whereas I think Florida represents a model where we can reverse the decline and have an American revival. So yes, there'll be differences that are discussed between the two states. But I think the more important part of the debate is, how does that factor into the nation's future?""
DeSantis' upcoming debate with Newsom will take place as various high-profile Democrats and their allies in the media have in recent days questioned whether Biden should be the Democrat nominee in 2024.


Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.): I was concerned before these polls, and I'm concerned now.


Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA): I think it is important to recognize that we have a very divided country, as you well know. You have said that polls really don't reflect where people are. I agree with you. But I will tell you, this is the first time, Jen, that I have felt like the 2024 election is in great trouble, for the president and for our democratic control, which is essential to moving forward.


Rep. Dean Philips: So the answer is yes, he will lose. And I'm not the only one that thinks that. I may be one of the few that's simply willing to say it out loud.


Former U.S. House Democrat Tim Ryan: Look, I've said this, Kasie—this is not breaking news. I don't think the president should run.


Miami Beach's former Democratic mayor Philip Levine: It is a little bit like your grandfather running the company and you know that he's at a point now where the heirs could suffer value if we don't change management at the top. And this is very difficult. How do we get grandpa to relinquish the CEO role?


DNC Member: It would be irresponsible for us to not be concerned at this point. People can be hopeful about what the result is going to be. But we don't have any evidence as to why we should be hopeful. The polling is bad. The approval ratings are bad. We know about concerns about both the president's age and about the vice president if she were to take over.


David Axelrod, Former Senior Advisor to President Obama: The @POTUS is justly proud of his accomplishments. Trump is a dangerous, unhinged demagogue whose brazen disdain for the rules, norms, laws and institutions or democracy should be disqualifying. But the stakes of miscalculation here are too dramatic to ignore.


Only @JoeBiden can make this decision. If he continues to run, he will be the nominee of the Democratic Party. What he needs to decide is whether that is wise; whether it's in HIS best interest or the country's? (LINK)


Give me his record and chop 10 to 15 years off, I'd be really confident. People judge him on his public performance. That's what people see. That's where the erosion has been. It lends itself to Republican messaging. (LINK)


Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel Live!: Calls for Joe Biden to drop out are getting louder, but that could be because he couldn't hear them.


Bill Kristol, The Bulwark: It's time. President Biden has served our country well. I'm confident he'll do so for the next year. But it's time for an act of personal sacrifice and public spirit. It's time to pass the torch to the next generation. It's time for Biden to announce he won't run in 2024


Ross Douthat, New York Times: But in running Biden for re-election, Democrats are making a fateful bet that this successful management can simply continue through two sets of risks: the high stakes of the next election, in which a health crisis or just more slippage might be the thing that puts Trump back in the White House, and the different but also substantial stakes of another four-year term.


David Ignatius, Washington Post: President Biden should not run again in 2024


Zachary B. Wolf, CNN: Democrats are praying 2024 is not 1980 and Biden is not Carter

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Fox & Friends,2023-11-09T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-fox-friends,"
""I wasn't worried about debating the moderators, really wasn't even worried about debating the other candidates as much as articulating my vision directly about how I'll fight for people, how we'll win these big fights, and how we'll lead the country to an American revival."" 
Tallahassee, FL - After his resounding win on the debate stage yesterday, Ron DeSantis today joined Fox & Friends live.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On winning last night's debate:
I spoke directly to the American people about the issues facing the country. I wasn't worried about debating the moderators, really wasn't even worried about debating the other candidates as much as articulating my vision directly about how I'll fight for people, how we'll win these big fights, and how we'll lead the country to an American revival. But then the other thing is, of all of them up there, I have a record of actually doing things. I mean, even on the Hamas-Israel I was able to save Biden abandoned Americans, he wasn't helping evacuate in the aftermath of the attack by Hamas, so I sent planes and we rescued 700+ Americans -- mostly Floridians, a lot of children. Some of them may have ended up becoming hostages. Then we're talking about the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. I banned China from buying land in the state of Florida. We kicked them out of our universities with these things like these Confucius Institutes, which do the ideology. So it's not just rhetoric with me. I've backed it up with actions. Ultimately, it's not just your words, it's your deeds. So people can trust me that everything I'm saying, I'm going to follow through on because that's exactly what I've done as governor.
On Donald Trump's empty promises:
He had a chance to show up, and he had a chance to make his case. He's choosing not to do that. I do think in these early states, these voters are starting to key in, and I do think it's going to hurt him. I think you saw some of these focus groups that said he should show up to debate. We've got Americans being held hostage right now by Hamas. I mean, the stakes are high. You have a responsibility to earn this nomination and also defend your record. I mean, he's running -- I saw the rally a little bit of it. And it reminded me like it's like deja vu all over again. You go back to 2016, he is saying a lot of the same things and promising a lot of the same things he didn't deliver on. Border wall built with Mexico paying for it didn't happen, drain the swamp didn't happen, reducing the debt didn't happen. We added more. So why not get on that stage and explain and then articulate how you're going to do a better job the next time. So I think it is going to hurt him if he doesn't show up. I'm going to show up. I'm going to be at the debates. I'm going to be on the ground in the early states, and we're going to earn it.
On Republican losses under Donald Trump:
But the idea that he is responsible for Florida's success is absurd. And when he says he endorses, and somehow that means -- if his endorsement was so important, why have Republicans been losing so many of these races where he's endorsed? We have fewer governors than when he got elected president, fewer US senators, fewer US House members.
On American airstrikes in the Middle East:
I did see the map, and you have places like al-Assad airbase and some of these other places that we were involved in, and for sure, it's sad to see that. So here, when we have American troops in harm's way, we do not let hostile enemies take potshots at us without an appropriate response. And Joe Biden is basically allowing the Iranians to attack our troops. And his responses are underwhelming, so it's just inviting more attacks. And so just from a normal perspective, now, I would also say this, what is their mission there? Biden hasn't really articulated what their mission there is, presumably some type of counterterrorism mission. But I would note, we have terrorists coming in across our southern border. He's not doing anything about to stop that. And we know, unfortunately, that that's the truth. So I think we get into trouble if we're putting our troops in places where we don't have a clear mission or clear objective. Iraq's government at this point, yes, there's a Sunni-Shia conflict, but it's like, okay, the Shia government is aligned with Iran. They're hostile to the United States, and we have our troops in there to potentially prop that government up? So it's really an odd situation. But clearly, I think he's inviting more attacks on our troops.

""As Governor of Florida, I delivered on 100% of my promises, I'll do that as President, but also deliver on his promises that he didn't fulfill."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Hallie Jackson and Tom Llamas for NBC's Post Debate Coverage. Read the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On Governor Reynolds' historic endorsement:
I do think with Kim Reynolds endorsing me, I think that that's a big moment for the Iowa caucus because I've talked to people in Iowa. Basically, they said, you know, when Governor Reynolds came out for Governor DeSantis, basically that's telling Iowa caucus-goers, 'You know what, you got to plug it now,' and you're going to start seeing that.
On Trump's downfall:
Donald Trump is not the same guy he was in 2016. You would not have been able to keep him off that stage in 2016. The consultants would not have been able to do that. Now, they don't want him up on the stage. When he gives speeches, it's usually off the teleprompter. And I think his view is like, well, he has a polling lead, therefore, why would he want to get involved and actually earn the job? But that's not the way this goes. So, what I think you're going to see, because I'm on the ground in the early states, voters are now starting to really pay attention. It is going to hurt him if he's not willing to debate going forward, because voters expect you to earn their vote. And if you look at his support, he's got some that are rock solid, he probably doesn't have to debate, but other supporters of his are willing to go for another candidate.
On how he will follow through on Trump's broken promises:
Here's how I view the Republican electorate: 25% are going to do Trump no matter what, give or take, 25% have moved on. They don't want to do it. And then the 50% in the middle, they're conservative voters, America first voters. They would vote for him, but they'd also vote for someone else... So what you have to do is you have to prove yourself. And it's not a question of attacking him as much as just telling the truth. So, for example, when I'm on the campaign trail, I always say, he said Mexico would pay for the border wall. Now what he's saying is, 'Well, there was no legal mechanism I could have done...' I think if you guys covered that campaign, he was very clear Mexico [would] pay for the wall. But the thing is, people told them at the time, you could tax the remittances of foreign workers, and you can raise the billions, so I will actually do that. So, what I tell people is, as Governor of Florida, I delivered on 100% of my promises. I'll do that as President, but also deliver on his promises that he didn't fulfill.

Statement by Doug Burgum on the Republican Debate,2023-11-08T00:00:00+00:00,Doug Burgum,/documents/statement-doug-burgum-the-republican-debate,"
Governor and business leader Doug Burgum issued the below statement following tonight's GOP debate:
""Over two hours filled with petty attacks and in-fighting, voters learned why none of the career politicians on stage will be President and why political insiders have no business trying to artificially shrink the Republican field two months before the actual voting starts in Iowa and New Hampshire.
In business, we never would've gotten anything done if all we did was yell and name-call. We built a billion-dollar company from scratch by building great teams, serving customers, and providing a product that people wanted. In fact, I have created more jobs than everyone on the stage combined. I spent 30 years in software. Technology is changing every industry, business, and job in America. Software is the greatest invention to expand human capability in the history of mankind… and we haven't even begun to touch the revolution it can lead in reducing the size of the federal government.
That's what I'm doing as Governor. We're reinventing government to serve its customers—the taxpayers. As a result, our state's economy is on fire. We passed the largest tax cut in history, cut spending by 27 percent and slashed red tape. Innovation over regulation is the path to unleashing America's strength and power.
We had team members in 132 countries. I've dealt with China in business. We can't win this war against Iran, crush Mob Boss Putin or win the Cold War with China with Biden's failed energy policies which hurt Americans and help foreign dictators. We're fighting with one hand tied behind our back. When I am your president we will sell energy to our allies, instead of buying it from our enemies.
If we're going to unlock the best of America and achieve our fullest potential, it's going to take a business leader and political outsider to get the job done. That's why I'm running for President. Pundits, political insiders and party bosses don't pick Presidents; voters do.""

""It's restoring faith, restoring our Christian values that will help this nation once again become the city on the hill."" – Tim Scott 
WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: Well, certainly what I would say without any question is that the truth of my life destroys the lies of the radical left. We need a president and a candidate who will actually help our base solidify and attract independent voters into our party. The Great Opportunity Party is now winning back African American voters and Hispanic voters because we are working on a foundation based on faith. Our nation is facing some deep challenges. It is the loss of faith in this nation. That is a part of the erosion that we're seeing every single day. It's restoring faith, restoring our Christian values that will help this nation once again become the city on the hill when Ronald Reagan talked about the city on the hill. He was coming from Matthew 5, when President Lincoln talked about a house divided. That was Mark, our founding documents speak to the importance of the faith foundation. You don't have to be a Christian for America to work for you. But America does not work without a faith-filled Judeo Christian foundation. I would be the president helps us restore faith in God, faith in each other, and faith in our future. Without that focus, none of the issues the policies matter. We have to get back to being a nation that is, in fact, the city on the hill that believes in each other enough for us to fight for that future.

Lester Holt: Let me just follow up the idea of pumping gas and turning on pipelines that doesn't make gas cheaper that day. I'm talking about you become president. What can you do specifically to help people feel better about their situation or be better with their situation?
Tim Scott: Well actually it does to be honest with you. The way the economy works is on the ability to anticipate excess supply versus the demand when that happens. Confidence drives our prices down because we know there's gonna be a greater surplus when you allow for those who have leases to actually start drilling to start using those leases for for more energy excavation. You put our economy in the strongest position and as a result of that, prices start going down that is the kind of economy that as President of the United States, I would lead this nation to making sure that we first use the resources in our own country and not going outside of our country in order to achieve our objective. You know, Proverbs 22:7 reminds us that the borrower is slave to the lender. We have become an indentured servant too often to countries like China.

We will support you, we will be there with you, will stand shoulder to shoulder. There will be no daylight. But I will change the station a little bit and head back home to America. I will say to President Biden, diplomacy only is a weak strategy. Appeasement leads to war from President Obama to President Biden. Obama sent millions to Iran. Frankly, President Biden has sent billions to Iran. That is why I've said that there's blood dripping from the hands of President Obama and President Biden. I would tell President Biden with great clarity, If you want to stop the 40 plus attacks on military personnel in the Middle East, you have to strike in Iran. If you want to make a difference, you cannot just continue to have strikes in Syria on warehouses, you actually have to cut off the head of the snake and the head of the snake is Iran and not simply the proxies. In order for us to have a powerful response from America, we have to be in a position of strength. As far as the United States, my foreign policy is simple. You cannot negotiate with evil. You have to destroy it as President of the United States.

Tim Scott: Well, I'm 100% pro-life. I have a 100% pro-life voting record. I would certainly as President the United States have a 15-week national limit. I would not allow states like California, Illinois or New York to have an abortion up until the day of birth. I certainly wouldn't allow for governors like the former Democratic governor of Virginia who talked about infanticide. We need a 15 week federal limit. Three out of four Americans agree with a 15-week limit. 47 out of 50 countries in Europe agree with a 15-week limit. I would challenge both Nikki and Ron to join me at a 15-week limit. It is in our nation's best interest, and frankly I think it's unethical and immoral to allow for abortions up until the day of birth. We have an opportunity in this nation to stop reckless behavior from states like California, New York, and Illinois and go step further. In my parents plan we start by talking about funding and allocating resources to crisis pregnancy centers. We should support adoption. There are a number of ways that we can say to the expectant mother, that we stand with you. We should not only be pro life before the child was born, we should be pro-life after the child is born just as much.

If you're able bodied in America, you work. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. If you commit a violent crime, you go to jail. And if God made you a man, you play sports against men.

""I'm sick of Republicans losing. In Florida, I showed how it's done."" 
MIAMI, FL - Ron DeSantis notched his third debate win tonight at the Adrienne Arsht Center in Miami. After this debate performance and a historic endorsement earlier this week from Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, his momentum is accelerating as Caucus Night in Iowa approaches.
Following the debate, Ron DeSantis for President campaign manager James Uthmeier said:
""Three debates, three home runs for Ron DeSantis. The momentum in this race is clear: following a historic endorsement by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and a big debate win in front of a hometown Miami crowd, Ron DeSantis has Donald Trump on the defensive with the Iowa Caucus just 68 days away. From sending troops to combat the southern border invasion, to prohibiting China land buying, to unleashing American energy dominance and economic growth - Ron DeSantis showed he will fight and win for the American people. Ron DeSantis knows how to fight the tough fights and secure big wins, and it was clear in this debate he's the best candidate to lead our nation's great comeback as Commander-in-Chief.""
The top moment of the night came when DeSantis said: ""I'm sick of Republicans losing. In Florida, I showed how it's done.""
""This country is in trouble, and the elites that have put us here, they don't care about you. They don't care that you're having to grapple with higher grocery prices or have higher gas prices. They don't care that your family is less secure, because of the open border that's allowed drugs and even terrorists to come into this country. Well, I care. I am not going to sit idly by and let this country continue its downward spiral. We need leadership, and we need it now. I'll take the hits. I'll take the arrows I'll take the slings. Because ultimately, it's not about me. It's about you. I will fight for you. I will make sure to lead this country's revival, and I will win for you and your family. Actions speak louder than words. We don't have time for excuses, and it's not something that we're going to be able to have all these distractions. As a veteran, I will get the job done. Now if you look where we are now, it's a lot different than we were in 2016, and Donald Trump's a lot different guy than he was in 2016. He owes it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance. He should explain why he didn't have Mexico pay for the border wall. He should explain why he racked up so much debt. He should explain why he didn't drain the swamp. And he said Republicans were going to get tired of winning. Well, we saw last night - I'm sick of Republicans losing. In Florida, I showed how it's done. One year ago here we won a historic victory, including a massive landslide right here in Miami Dade County. That's how we have to do it. So, I promise you this: as the nominee next November I'll get the job done, and as President I will deliver for you.""
Watch HERE.
Another big moment came when DeSantis said: ""Nikki Haley welcomed them into South Carolina, gave them land near a military base, wrote the Chinese ambassador a love letter saying what a great friend they were. In Florida, I banned China from buying land.""
""We have to have the ability to back up a strategy of denial of President Xi's ambitions. And if China's able to be the world's leading superpower that will affect you and your family in ways that are going to be very bad. They will export authoritarianism all around the world as the cost of doing business. They'll impose things like social credit scores and internet monitoring. So this is to this generation, what the Soviet Union was to the post World War 2 generation. I've already released a plan. We're going to get to 355 ships at the end of the first term. 385 ships at the end of the second term, but we're going to have a path to 600 ships over the next 20 years. I think the future of freedom is going to be determined in the Indo-Pacific. We have a strategy - not just military, but decoupling from the economy and fighting them here at home with their cultural - Ambassador Haley said somehow I wasn't doing- She welcomed them into South Carolina. Gave them land near a military base. Wrote the Chinese ambassador a love letter saying what a great friend they were. That was like their number one way to do economic development. In Florida, I banned China from buying land in this state. and we kicked out - their universities - And we kicked the Confucius Institutes out of our universities. We've recognized the threat, and we've acted swiftly and decisively.""

Op-Ed by Tim Scott: Biden and Democrats Must Stop Embracing Anti-Semitism,2023-11-07T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/op-ed-tim-scott-biden-and-democrats-must-stop-embracing-anti-semitism,"

Biden and Democrats Must Stop Embracing Anti-Semitism
In 1790, as our nation was establishing the bedrock of our shared values and moral clarity, President George Washington penned a letter to the Jewish congregation. He reassured them that our new country would give bigotry no sanction, no assistance, to persecution. He said the children of Abraham would not live in fear.
Today, we see a failure to fulfill that promise. It has been eclipsed by a subhuman evil and the embrace of antisemitism — antisemitism that has been permitted to fester on the radical Left wing of American politics.
On the campuses of our universities, you will find the adoption of pro-genocide and pro-Hamas mantras, the spreading of antisemitic propaganda, the prescription of ""one solution"" policies, and demonstrations praising Hamas' unfathomable acts of terror....
If this were any other minority group, the far Left would be apoplectic, and the media would be insatiable.
Progressives claim to be advocates of the safety and the rights of minorities, the oppressed and the marginalized. But when it comes to Jewish Americans who are hurting, they're silent.
Make no mistake: There is no barrier stopping President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries from denouncing these disrupters and seeing their retribution. But they seem more offended by microaggressions than by mass murder.
The only thing in their way is their power. They would rather embrace antisemitism within their ranks than upset their liberal base. They would rather defend terrorism than betray ""woke"" ideology....

""I believe that Ron is the right person for the right job. And I believe he's going to win.""
Des Moines, IA - Ron DeSantis and Kim Reynolds joined Dasha Burns and Brianne Pfannenstiel for sit-down interviews that aired on NBC and ran in print in the Des Moines Register. See below.
Watch interview Here:
LESTER: As the GOP presidential candidates prepared to meet on our stage here in Miami on Wednesday, one of them, Ron DeSantis, is getting a major boost as Iowa's governor makes a rare endorsement. Both spoke with Dasha Burns.
DASHA: Tonight, Governor Kim Reynolds explaining why she's breaking with the Iowa tradition of staying neutral and endorsing Ron DeSantis.
GOV REYNOLDS: I just felt like I couldn't sit on the sidelines any longer. We have too much at stake. I truly believe that he is the right person to get this country back on track.
DASHA: It is arguably the biggest endorsement of the primary and a much-needed win for the DeSantis campaign, which has invested significant time and resources here.
GOV DESANTIS: This one's obviously very meaningful because Kim has proven to be a great leader that Iowans love.
DASHA: With two months to go, former President Trump maintains a dominant 27-point lead among likely Iowa caucus goers, with DeSantis and Nikki Haley tied for second. For those who criticize you and say, why are you endorsing a guy who's been slipping in the polls, Trump's 30-points ahead, what do you say to those critics?
GOV REYNOLDS: I don't base my decision on polls. I take a look at who I believe is the right person for the right job. I believe that Ron is the right person for the right job. And I believe he's going to win.
DASHA: Do you worry about the risk that she's taking by endorsing you?
GOV DESANTIS: No, I don't. I mean, first of all, I respect the fact that that's not her calculation, which is rare amongst elected officials. I've had people come to me and say, you know, that they endorsed him because of the threats and everything like that. If you can look in the mirror and say you did what you think is right for the right reasons, then just let the chips fall where they may.
DASHA: Mr. Trump was quick to attack Governor Reynolds for her endorsement, calling her America's most unpopular governor. What is your relationship like now with the former president?
GOV REYNOLDS: Well, you know, I assume it's, it's -- well, I don't know. I really can't tell you. That's probably a question for him.
DASHA: Have you spoken with him recently?
GOV REYNOLDS: No, I haven't.
DASHA: When's the last time?
GOV REYNOLDS: Probably the last time he called to ask if I would endorse him, and I said I wasn't at this point.
DASHA: The question now if her endorsement of DeSantis will make a difference.
IA VOTER: I just hope that it'll help persuade some of those voters to take a look at him closer.
IA VOTER: Does it impact my vote? I don't know for sure at this point. He's been on my radar, so I, maybe I'll feel like I know a little bit more after the debate.
DASHA: Do you believe Trump can't win?
GOV REYNOLDS: Yeah, I believe he can't win. And I believe Ron can.
DASHA: If DeSantis wants to prove Trump is beatable, he'll have to do it here. Dasha Burns, NBC News, Des Moines, Iowa.
Gov. Kim Reynolds endorses Ron DeSantis, says US can't gamble on another Trump candidacyDes Moines RegisterBrianne Pfannenstiel
Ron DeSantis and Kim Reynolds also joined Brianne Pfannenstiel of the Des Moines Register for a sit-down interview. Read the article below.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president, she told the Des Moines Register Monday, because the country is at an ""unprecedented"" moment and Republicans can't gamble on another Donald Trump candidacy.
""We are living in unprecedented times and this country is in trouble,"" Reynolds said, sitting next to DeSantis at her Terrace Hill home in Des Moines ahead of an evening rally where she'll make the endorsement publicly.
""I cannot believe how it has declined over just the short time under President Biden,"" she said. ""And we're resilient. We'll be able to come back from this. But if we don't win this next election, we're done.""
Reynolds, who had been a Trump ally when he held the White House, said she appreciates the former president's accomplishments but believes it's time to move on.
""I don't think he can win,"" she said simply.
Instead, she's throwing her support behind DeSantis, a fellow governor who she said has an admirable track record of accomplishment in Florida that he would bring to the nation as a whole.
""I believe he's the candidate that can win,"" she said. ""And we also not only need somebody that can win, but we need somebody that has the skill and the resolve, which he clearly does, to reverse the madness that we see happening across this country.""
Currently, Trump leads the latest Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll with 43% support among likely Republican caucusgoers. DeSantis is tied for second place with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley at 16%.
Reynolds said she believes DeSantis can win the Iowa caucuses, and she hopes to help move across the finish line.
DeSantis told the Register that Reynolds' endorsement is meaningful, not only because of the star power she brings to the race, but because he believes Iowa and Florida represent the future of the party.
""It's meaningful to me, because this is really the model I think that the Republican Party can use to succeed going forward,"" DeSantis said of Reynolds' endorsement. ""What Kim's done here, what we've done in Florida, Brian Kemp in Georgia --- these are states that used to be viewed as very competitive, and we've been able to win really, really big victories. And I think it's because of leadership and then results.""
Trump has already lashed out at Reynolds in a string of social media posts, accusing her of being ""disloyal"" and arguing her endorsement of DeSantis is ""the end of her political career.""
DeSantis defended Reynolds against Trump and his loyalists, some of whom have called her a RINO, or a ""Republican in name only.""
""I think what some of these influencers will say is, if you don't kiss the ring for Trump for 2024, then somehow you're a RINO,"" he said. ""You have some people that have horrendous records, but if they kiss the ring, somehow they're great. Like, that is not good posture. Because we're in this, not for personality, we're in it to deliver results for people. ... And so I think that when Trump is attacking really strong, accomplished Republicans for self-serving reasons, that's a dead end for the Republican Party.""
Reynolds agreed. ""That is destructive to the party,"" she said.
It's rare, though not unprecedented, for Iowa's top elected officials to weigh in on behalf of candidates ahead of the caucuses.
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley endorsed his good friend, U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, in 1988 and 1996, and former Gov. Terry Branstad encouraged Iowans to caucus for anyone but U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016.
But it's far more common for Iowa's high-profile political figures to take a hands-off approach. Grassley and others have pledged to remain neutral this cycle.
Reynolds, too, had initially ruled out endorsing anyone ahead of the Iowa Caucuses, saying she preferred to welcome the full slate of candidates into the state. But, more recently, she opened the door to the possibility.
She said Monday that she believes she fulfilled her duty by welcoming all the candidates to the state and helping give them a platform to reach Iowans.
""For seven months I did that --- attended a lot of events, made a lot of phone calls, helped talk about events to go to and to be in front of,"" she said.
Ultimately, though, she said she felt called to step in.
""As a mother and as a grandmother and as an American, I just felt like I couldn't stand on the sidelines any longer,"" she said. ""We have too much at stake. Our country is in a world of hurt. The world is a powder keg. And I think it's just really important that we put the right person in office.""
She said the timing of her endorsement is less about strategy. She decided she wanted to endorse, and as soon as she did she wanted to make it public.
""Once I was in, I was all in,"" she said.
Reynolds and DeSantis have charted similar political paths, growing their national profiles amid the COVID-19 pandemic when they led Republican states in pushing back against shutdowns and mask mandates while leaning into controversial culture war issues.
Both governors have signed laws prohibiting school instruction in LGBTQ topics and offering state-funded private school scholarships to all families. Both governors have also banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy --- Trump called the Florida version of that bill ""a terrible mistake.""
Reynolds said she remembers getting a phone call from DeSantis in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both had made the decision to send kids back to classrooms and were facing a wave of backlash over a decision they believe now was the right one.
The pair talked about ""what we were going through"" and ""having the moral conviction to do the right thing when the right thing is not easy to do,"" Reynolds said.
More recently, when Reynolds' husband, Kevin, was diagnosed with cancer, she got another phone call from DeSantis, and his wife, Casey, who previously battled breast cancer. DeSantis offered to connect Reynolds to doctors, and Casey came to visit.
""Not only is he tough and disciplined, but he's compassionate and cares,"" Reynolds said.
DeSantis has previously suggested that Reynolds could be a good running mate during his presidential bid. He said Monday that he continues to believe she would be a good pick, but he perhaps underestimated the number of Iowans who want to keep her in the state.
""Bottom line is she's qualified for the positions that have been mentioned,"" he said. ""But I also respect Iowans in terms of their views on some of this stuff too.""
Reynolds said governors continue to play a big role in guiding the country forward, and DeSantis would need strong governors if he takes office.
""I'm focused on, really, on this next cycle, and I'm focused on serving Iowans and getting this guy elected,"" she said. ""That's what I'm focused on.""

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Ron DeSantis Receives Historic Endorsement from Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds,2023-11-06T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-ron-desantis-receives-historic-endorsement-from-iowa,"
This is the first time since 1996 that a sitting Iowa governor has endorsed in a contested Republican presidential primary. 
Des Moines, IA - Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds endorsed Ron DeSantis for president today on stage at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa. Reynolds' endorsement is historic — she is the first sitting Iowa governor to endorse in a contested Republican presidential primary since 1996.
Reynolds said:
""We are resilient. We can turn this country around. But if we don't get this next election right, if we don't choose right, we are not going to get this country back. So, we have to do everything we can to make the right choice. Not only do we need to make sure that we elect someone who can win and beat Joe Biden, we need a president who has the skill and the resolve to reverse the madness that we see every single day. We need someone who will fight for you and win for you. We need someone who won't get distracted but will stay disciplined, who puts this country first and not himself. That leader is Ron DeSantis!""
""At a time when the world is spinning out of control, that is what we should be looking for in a president. Someone who gets results, who devotes every single ounce of their energy to make our lives better, someone who's honest, and who actually knows what it's like to be sent to war, someone that knows when life begins and thinks it's a beautiful thing to save a beating heart. Someone who calls out our moral decline for what it is, who looks to the future and not the past, someone who most importantly, can win. And that person is Ron DeSantis. And that is why I am so proud to stand here tonight and give him my full support and endorsement for President of the United States of America!""
Watch her speech here:
Today's rally marks the sixth public event that Reynolds has participated in with Ron or Casey DeSantis. Reynolds first joined Ron DeSantis in Iowa in March 2022 during his first visit to the state. Reynolds introduced DeSantis at his presidential launch event in Des Moines, DeSantis joined Reynolds for her Fairside Chat series at the Iowa State Fair in August, and Reynolds joined Florida's First Lady Casey DeSantis to officially launch DeSantis' national coalition, ""Mamas for DeSantis.""
Since announcing his candidacy for president, DeSantis has:

Visited 87 of Iowa's 99 counties (and will visit all 99 before the caucus);
Earned endorsements from 41 state legislators (more than any candidate in the race); and
Has made over 100 stops in the Hawkeye State.

DeSantis and Reynolds are strong conservative leaders who have taken decisive action to help the people of their states. Both governors have:

Championed universal school choice (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Protected parents' rights (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Enacted meaningful tax reform (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Run budget surpluses (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Kept their states open during COVID lockdowns (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Signed Heartbeat legislation to protect life (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Stood for law and order (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Took action to protect our southern border (Reynolds and DeSantis);
Protected women and fairness in sports (Reynolds and DeSantis);
And more.

MEMORANDUM
TO:     ?INTERESTED PARTIESFR:     JENNIFER DeCASPER, CAMPAIGN MANAGERRE:     TIM SCOTT FOR AMERICA: WHAT TO EXPECT IN MIAMI

We're on the cusp of the 3rd debate. And let's be honest — we all know what will happen.
Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis will devolve into a slugfest. She'll attack him for the failing candidate that he is. He'll attack her for being the moderate that she is. They'll both be right.
Voters will shake their heads and wonder how either of these candidates could possibly go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump or beat Joe Biden.
We must move past just the ""what"" of policy arguments and personal attacks and start asking ""How do you actually win?""
WINNING AS A CONSERVATIVE
Republican voters are sick and tired of being told they have to choose between real conservatives who share their values or electable candidates who can win the general.
That is a false choice. Conservatives don't have to compromise or hold their noses. In this primary, the conservative fighter and the winner are the same man.
Does anyone actually believe that a moderate who is running as the darling of Never Trumpers can win the GOP nomination? Nikki's canned lines can't change the fact that her ceiling is low and getting lower. Just ask Iowa Republicans. While nearly 70% say Tim Scott is conservative, just 36% say the same about her.
What about the man who spent $100 million to drop 30 points in the polls? The only thing consistent about Ron DeSantis' campaign is how much it's underwhelmed.
To say nothing of the obvious question: How can either candidate present a contrast with Donald Trump when he made each of their political careers?
That is the conversation Tim Scott will start Wednesday night. Tim Scott has the conservative credentials our base demands. The same ones Nikki Haley abandoned.
Tim Scott has an optimistic vision voters want. The same one Ron DeSantis can't articulate.
And Tim Scott is the best candidate to flip swing states that President Trump lost in 2020 and create a red wave up and down the ballot.
IOWA FUNDAMENTALS IN OUR FAVOR
At this same point in past cycles, names like Rudy Giuliani, Carly Fiorina, Rick Perry, and Michelle Bachmann were in double digits in Iowa. Meanwhile, eventual Iowa caucus winners such as Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, and Mike Huckabee were all in single digits. For each of them, evangelical voters were the lynchpin to their success.
This time around, that evangelical lane has yet to be filled. And Tim is well-positioned to fill it.
According to our internal polling, almost half of all evangelical caucusgoers are ""persuadable"" and are open to voting for someone other than Trump. This group alone represents 20% of the entire electorate — and they're completely up for grabs.
Today, Tim has the highest net favorability rating among this community (77% to 8%).
THE MAN THE LEFT FEARS THE MOST
NBC, the network sponsoring the debate said, ""Democrats see [Tim] as a tough general election opponent.""
The left knows a Tim Scott-led ticket would usher in a red wave that would not just flip the White House but also carry the House and Senate. It would finally allow us to both win as conservatives and govern as conservatives.
That's why they fear him.
Because at the end of the day, that's what it's about: winning.
Isn't it time we chose someone who can actually do it?

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Sandra Smith and John Roberts on Fox News Channel's America Reports. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On his leadership in supporting Israel:
When the attacks happened, I knew that this was going to impact Florida because we have a very strong relationship with Israel. There's a lot of affinities with our people, and there's a lot of cross pollination. We have a big Israeli-American population, and what we found after a day or two is that people were stranded. They weren't getting help from the State Department. They weren't getting help from the embassy there in Jerusalem. And so I did an executive order in Florida, and we were able to scramble planes and bring back mostly Floridians, but not all because there were other Americans who were stranded; we're all Americans in this. So we ended up bringing back, rescuing over 700 people back to Florida. And my wife and I were there greeting the first plane that came by -- 271 Total people, but 91 children. And so that really brings it home, that you had families with young children. I had one mother point to her, looked like about a five or six year old daughter, and say to me for the last two nights she just kept saying, 'Mommy, I can't have the rockets anymore. I need Florida. We've got to get back to Florida.' So we were able to help do that. And then when the planes went back to pick up more people, they were able to bring a lot of donated supplies, medical supplies, but also things that were donated like Kevlar and helmets and a whole bunch of things that can be useful as Israel defends itself in this war.
On securing the border and combatting terrorism:
I'd deport those people immediately. Do you not think that after these last two and a half years, our enemies have not taken advantage of that border? Of course they have. We know people from the Middle East have poured in. You guys showed on the graphic I saw all the people on the terrorist watch lists that have come in just in the last year. It is unbelievable. We would have never allowed that, say in the aftermath of 9/11. You have Iranians have come, Russia, China, all of that has happened. So I'd be very aggressive at sending people back. Obviously, stopping the invasion further, but it is a threat to terrorism what's happened there. What I'd also say, though, and you pointed out some of these demonstrations, you know, I went to -- I joke, I'm one of the few people that got through Harvard and Yale and came out more conservative than when I went in because they're known to be very left wing. But even back in that day, I don't think a lot of students would have, in the aftermath of an attack when the blood wasn't even dry on Israeli citizens, gone out and celebrated that. Yet, we've seen that at some of the most august institutions in this country. So there's a sickness that's in these institutions. I've said any foreign student on a visa who's making common cause with Hamas, I'd cancel the visa, and I'D send them home. But we also have to look inside about how we got to this point in this country where you can go out there and proudly advocate for effectively a second holocaust. It's totally unacceptable.
On putting in the work in Iowa:
You've looked at the Iowa caucus polls the last few times--whoever was winning right now in those polls did not actually win the Iowa caucus. And so this thing is very dynamic. It is just getting underway where people are starting to pay attention. Look, I think Donald Trump's the most famous person in politics. I mean, so he has a great name ID, gets a lot of media coverage. As a default, you can understand that. But there's a lot of voters that are up for grabs, and we're going to make it happen. And the hard work we've put in going to these, a lot of the rural counties, you know, that's not something that will necessarily show up in polls. That's something that shows up on caucus night when people bring their friends and family and come out and are willing to go through very cold temperatures to stand for what, two, three hours, potentially through a caucus and listen to the speeches and do all that. So that's what we're doing. We're doing what it takes to win, and we're going to get the job done, notwithstanding whatever polls this far out would say.
On his support in Florida:
I must have missed where those voters have actually voted yet. Isn't it odd that we haven't had one contest, and there's people that are having a rush to try to sort of short circuit the people's voice. So the people haven't been able to speak. That's one of the reasons why we're here in Iowa. I'm now in my 85th county out of 99. I'm going to be the only candidate that does all 99 counties. I think it's important that you show up, you ask for the vote, you tell them what you're going to do. And I can tell you, obviously, the former president has support, but there's a lot of people that haven't made up their mind. There's people that are leaning to him now who are not, have not made a final decision. And so you're going to start to see, as we get in the next couple of months and into the new year, you're going to start to see people make some decisions about, okay, what's the pathway for the Republican party going forward? And with me, they get somebody who will fight for them, which is important, but will also win, win the election but win the fights, and then lead this country to a comeback. That's what we did in Florida. We were able to create huge success. We're continuing to do that. They just had the figures this week. We lead again in net in-migration in 2022. Massive numbers of people are flocking because of what we've been able to do. That's the type of leadership that can work nationally. That's the type of model Republicans need to gravitate towards if we want to win.

Op-Ed by Tim Scott: Liberal Control Has Failed Urban America,2023-11-03T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/op-ed-tim-scott-liberal-control-has-failed-urban-america,"
Newsmax11/2/23
Last week, I toured the South Side of Chicago with Pastor Corey Brooks, a maverick man of God and community activist, and borrowed his pulpit.
I brought a message of love and concern for Chicago and cities nationwide: The progressive monopoly in urban politics, policy, and culture has been a devastating failure for our cities — and the African-American community in particular.
Cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco have settled virtually every policy question in the liberal direction. They have given progressivism the keys to the kingdom.
They have strict gun control laws, high taxes, expansive social programs, soaring funding for union-dominated K-12 school systems, and leaders who jumped on the anti-police bandwagon in 2020 and 2021.
How's it going?
In Chicago, even after years of a hot job market, black unemployment is stuck above 10%. Fewer than 17% of minority kids can read at grade level. And four of every five African-American kids are born to a mom and dad who aren't married.
In Baltimore, where government schools are getting record funding, 13 high schools had zero students proficient in math. In New York City, tax dollars are putting illegal immigrants up in hotels while American citizens are crushed by housing inflation. In Philadelphia, a radical district attorney is undermining the rule of law and getting innocent people hurt.
The parts of America where the radical left has virtual monopoly power are utterly failing the very communities that liberals claim they want to help.
During last month's presidential debate, I pointed out a plain fact that is politically incorrect: While the evil of slavery was the worst chapter in American history, the institution of the black family survived it.
As recently as the 1960s, more than 70% of black kids grew up with two parents in the household. But then, in the name of helping low-income people, liberals dumped money into welfare programs that often required fathers to exit the household for checks to arrive in the mail. What's more, in the name of empathy and inclusion, liberals have led a cultural shift away from emphasizing the intact two-parent family.
Now, 60 years later, that statistic about the black family is upside down: More than 70% of African-American kids do not have both parents at home.
The black family survived slavery. The black middle class survived Jim Crow. The black church survived segregation.
The modern welfare state, the creep of socialism, and a victimhood culture that rejects individual responsibility and excuses drugs, crime, and riots have hollowed out neighborhoods.
Observing these simple truths earned me another round of personal attacks, including a racial slur from a sitting House Democrat who is black himself.
They will never intimidate me. I've heard it all.
If the far left truly cared about black and brown America, they would apologize and change direction. Instead, top Democrats feel entitled to play the race card for their own benefit. To distract from the devastation they've helped cause, they seize any opportunity to inflame and divide America on racial lines.
When Republicans in states like Georgia passed commonsense voting laws, President Biden called it ""Jim Crow 2.0"" and compared Republican senators like me to Bull Connor.
A few months ago, before Hamas slaughtered dozens of Americans in Israel, he claimed our most dangerous terrorist threat was white supremacy.
When he was last up for reelection in 2012, then-Vice President Biden told a black audience that Republicans would ""put y'all back in chains.""
This embarrassing rhetoric dishonors our true history. These painful parts of America's past are not Joe Biden's to invoke whenever he's losing an argument.
It's not just the president. The teachers union head Randi Weingarten recently said that people who support school choice and parents' rights are today's segregationists. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says even talking about an illegal immigration ""surge"" is white supremacy. Vice President Kamala Harris raised bail money for rioters who burned and devastated black and brown neighborhoods.
Worst of all, today's progressives steal hope and keep people down with a false gospel of racial pessimism. To protect their monopoly, they are getting communities hooked on the drug of victimhood and the narcotic of despair. Because, if we live in a systemically racist country, then the problems you see can't be Democrats' fault. Just sit down, shut up, stay mad, and vote blue.
I'm a conservative Republican. I know that all Americans, including minorities, benefit from school choice, thriving capitalism, and safer streets. But a national revival of individual responsibility will achieve more than policy fixes ever could. We have to climb out of the cultural quicksand.
America's teenagers don't need to hear moral relativism or victimhood propaganda. They need the respect and tough love that comes with expectations. They need to know basic facts — like that people who finish high school, get a job, get married, and have kids, in that order, cut their odds of living in poverty by 97%.
Freedom is impossible without responsibility. It's the price of American citizenship.
If you're able-bodied, you go to work.
If you commit a violent crime, you don't get to blame the police. You go to jail.
If you fail a class, don't blame things that happened a century before you were born. Study harder.
If you father a baby, congratulations — you now have the privilege of raising that child.
The radical left, the same people who see systemic racism and microaggressions around every corner, are the closest thing to the segregationists we have today.
The opponents of school choice are the ones standing in the schoolhouse door, making kids' futures a function of their race and class. Progressives would rather see a vacant lot in a black neighborhood turn into a Planned Parenthood clinic than a non-union school.
Their open borders are diverting resources from American citizens who are suffering. And their soft-on-crime policies and rhetoric are costing black and brown lives.
The progressive monopoly has left inner cities more despairing and America more divided. We need to replace grievance with greatness. We need to replace a culture of victimhood with a culture of aspiration and empowerment.
And most of all, we need a national revival of individual responsibility and accountability. Let's start it in the Oval Office.

""Not only can we win the primary, but we could bring new voters... into the Great Opportunity Party and have that governing mandate that comes from a red wave."" – Tim Scott
CEDAR RAPIDS, IA – This morning, Tim Scott joined The Brian Kilmeade Show to discuss the GOP debate next week and the importance of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel. Tim also discussed Joe Biden's Pentagon  policy of using taxpayer funds for abortion travel.
WATCH HERE
Brian Kilmeade: Are you upset with Tuberville?
Tim Scott: Listen, the problem we see today can be solved by Joe Biden today. We should not be using federal tax dollars for abortions, period. In no way, no shape, and no form should that be the case. It has not been the case until Joe Biden's administration took office. He is the problem. He also has the solution, period. It is not even a complicated conversation to have.
Brian Kilmeade: But Senator Sullivan, Senator Romney, you just heard from Sullivan, Ernst. Senator Graham thinks Tuberville is picking the wrong, he's punishing the wrong people and it's hurting our readiness. Do you believe that?
Tim Scott: I believe that Joe Biden is the problem. Joe Biden is hurting our readiness if there's a problem there. Joe Biden is a person who's derelict in his duties. He understands the objective more than anyone else. He's agreed with that objective for 45, 46 years, and now he's all of a sudden changed his course. The problem can be solved by this administration, and oh, by the way, our military should be focused on lethality, not all of the social challenges that has been brought into the military by this President focusing back on lethality. Eliminating the current debate over abortion is something the President of the United States can do right this very moment on his own. No action from Congress. Just do what the law says.
Brian Kilmeade: Alright, so you're with Tuberville?
Tim Scott: He is right on this issue.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: A Ceasefire Is Nothing More Than An Opportunity For Hamas To Reload,2023-11-02T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-ceasefire-nothing-more-than-opportunity-for-hamas,"
DECORAH, IA – Tonight, Tim Scott joined The Mark Levin Show from the campaign trail in Iowa to blast the Biden Administration's proposal for a 'pause' in the midst of Hamas' atrocities against the Israeli people. Tim stood firm that America must stand with Israel in their objective of wiping evil off the face of the Earth.
LISTEN HERE
Transcript:
Mark Levin: There's a lot of information that Biden and Blinken and that administration is putting enormous pressure almost to the point of threats on Netanyahu and his government to have what they call the humanitarian pause...
Tim Scott: It's unbelievable. In the day, he's all about supporting Israel. And in the evening time when the night starts and you can't see what he is doing, he supports a ceasefire. Let me just define a ceasefire for all of us to get on the same page. A ceasefire, Mark, is nothing more than an opportunity for Hamas to reload. If they were concerned about the Palestinians living in Hamas, they would tell them to leave. Do they say that, Mark? Of course not. Why? Because they want human shields. As a matter of fact, they said in their own way that they are a nation of martyrs. Martyrs are willing to die for the cause. What is their cause? Genocide. Would you give a group of people willing to die for the cause of Jewish genocide time to reload? No....
Tim Scott: The most humane thing to do, is to allow Israel to achieve their objective as quickly as possible, as effectively as possible. And by doing so, you'll save as many lives as possible. Any delay only creates more human suffering on both sides of the border. But most importantly, the only responsible response to an attempt at Jewish genocide, the only responsible response to terrorism, is to wipe the evil off the map. And if you listen to the words of Hamas themselves, they say they will repeat October 7th over and over and over and over until they achieve their objective of the elimination of the Jewish state. And then they must turn their sights to America because there's 6 million Jews here. So let us not forget that their objective isn't simply the elimination of Israel, it's the elimination of Jews. That means they must come to America. And if we don't stand with Israel now, who will stand with us later?

""I want to fight for people...and Donald Trump is perceived by Republicans as a fighter, but I also want to win for people. That means winning elections, but also means winning on these policy fights."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined MSNBC's Morning Joe this morning. Read the highlights below.
Watch the clips from the interview here and here.
On the House aid package for Israel:
I think they should offset the funding. I haven't looked at how the intricacies of the IRS funding would work. I mean, CBO, obviously, is a forecast. But I do think we have to stand with Israel. They're our strongest ally in the Middle East. They're going to fight this war. They're not asking us to fight it for them. But we have a relationship. And we need to back their ability to ultimately defeat Hamas unconditionally, once and for all, so that this never happens again. The same time, you can do that, while also just acknowledging this country is insolvent. We've got 33+ trillion dollars in debt, you're going to have to make some decisions at some point about how we're spending money. So I think if the House is doing that, I think that that is appropriate. I think that that's showing the urgency of our fiscal situation, while also recognizing we have to step up and help a very strong ally.
On holding the federal bureaucracy accountable:
You need to bring in serious accountability. I think back about some of the things that have happened with this government, the Afghanistan debacle, no one has been fired. As a result of that. That was one of the biggest fiascos that we've ever had. You've had government fall on its face time and time again, and yet, there's no accountability. So we do need an era of accountability. Obviously, we're going to do that within the context of the rule of law in the Constitution. But I want to make very clear to voters that I'm not just going to go up there and be nice about it. We're going to take very swift action to resize this government and re-constitutionalize that, but everyone should want to be very active in the process. But ultimately, you know, this is about making your voice heard at the ballot box and that we're going to do.
On his foreign policy plan and how China is a top threat to the US:
Well, first, just on the border, I just got to point out he's not actually providing money that would stop the problem. He's providing money to process more illegal aliens coming in, which I think would probably end up exacerbating and inviting the problem. I gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation on Friday laying out our national security strategy, we're going to focus on the Indo Pacific, what Biden's doing there is inadequate to deter China, that ultimately is the top threat to this country. I think Russia is hostile to the United States. But I think their threat, Europe is a more pressing part of their threat. So we need to have the Europeans step up.
On the need to balance the budget in Washington:
I think if you look at the unified government, over W Bush and under Trump, Republican unified government, they threw out all the fiscal constraints, that was not something people cared about. If you talked about it at that time, it was like they didn't want to hear it. The minute Republicans get out of power, then all of a sudden, they'd beat their chests, they become real fiscal hawks when it comes to all of this stuff. Now, part of the reason I think under Bush is because we had the lengthy wars, which were, which were clearly mismanaged, and we spent a lot of money that in hindsight, we shouldn't have done. But you know, I was there for the first two years of the Trump administration. There was a faction of us in the in the House that was urging him not to just sign these big omnibus spending bills, but he signed every spending bill that ever got to his desk, culminating in a big gusher of spending his last year in office, which of course, ended up adding $7.8 trillion to the debt in one four year period, as a president. Under the four years of Trump, he added almost as much to the debt as Obama did in eight years. And so there was no sense of fiscal restraint there. And so I make the point. And when I'm in Iowa, New Hampshire, that this is both parties. Republican voters do not believe it's just the Democrats because they've been let down before and I get a lot of cheers, when I point out that it has been both parties, and you can get it done. Like in Florida, we've paid down 25% of the debt since I've been governor. We've run surpluses, cut taxes and all that. But you do have to make some tough decisions. You can't please everyone all the time. And I think that the DC Republicans have bad short term thinking when it comes to our fiscal situation.
On the importance of showing up to debates:
We are not going to win as Republicans, Joe, by adopting the strategy that Biden did, being in the basement during the 2020 campaign. That's effectively what Donald Trump's doing, he is refusing to debate, we've got a lot of issues that this country is facing right now [that] require steady focus, strong leadership, you got to be able to defend your record. And you got to be able to articulate how you're going to take the country in a better direction. And so my view about why you should debate I mean, look, I want to fight for people, you know, and Donald Trump is perceived by Republicans as a fighter, but I also want to win for people. That means winning elections, but also means winning on these policy fights. Donald Trump even now is saying his famous promise to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it, that he never intended to do it. Because he said that Mexico, there was no mechanism to do it, you actually could have taxed the remittances. And that's what I would do. But we need to lead forward, you got to have a unifying vision, so he should do it, but I would note this. I mean, you mentioned some of the ever since I ran, there's always the narratives, Trump is spending massive amounts of money attacking me in Iowa. He's had to go campaign in Iowa. So if he's saying he's so far up, he doesn't need to debate that is belied by their activity on the ground there.
On the DOD's abortion tourism and Senator Tuberville's actions in the Senate:
DESANTIS: Actually, I think that what the DoD is doing, I don't think they're following the law with respect to abortion tourism. I don't think taxpayer money should be spent on that. We have a very weak defense industrial base, we've got huge problems with recruiting. And so their focus on that I don't think it's consistent with the law. I also think it's misguided. I would also point out that you can promote people on an individual basis, I think the Senate has decided they have not wanted to move a lot of those. But if there's people that are mission-critical, they can move it in spite of what Senator Tuberville did. But I think fighting back on the Pentagon, going outside the boundaries of the law, I think that's Congress's appropriate role of oversight and checks and balances.
MIKA: So to answer the question, do you think that Senator Tuberville should lift the blockade that he's put on military promotions?
DESANTIS: No, because I think that he were trying to force a change in Pentagon policy, to conform them to the law, while at the same time he has allowed individuals to be appointed. So if there are mission-critical promotions, bring them before the Senate, I think he's been very clear that that's appropriate. And I know that they have done that, in certain instances.
On Trump's attacks on the pro-life movement and the importance of putting the American people first:
It's a stark difference from his speech at the March for Life when he was president. I mean, I was not what he was saying then. He said that he was one of us in terms of being a pro-life President. Now he's saying protections when there is a detectable heartbeat for an unborn child is somehow a terrible thing. That is not what Iowa Republicans believe. I think more and more we're going to be familiar with those comments over the next couple of months. But it is a flip on where he had been previously. And I think it raises the issue of, you go back to 2015 2016, the Trump of that time, he was clicking as a candidate. I mean, he had energy, he was out there riffing very, he was controversial, but in a way that was edgy. And I think people said, 'You know what this political system needs to be shaken up.' This is a different Donald Trump in2023. I don't think he's got the same energy. I don't think he's got the same pizzazz. It 2015 and '16 was about America first. I think this campaign is more about Trump first. And it's more about his issues. And I think we got to focus on the American people's issues.

""This is no time for foot fetishes. We've got serious problems as a country.""
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis spoke with Newsmax's Eric Bolling today to challenge Trump to debate on the issues that matter to the American people instead of obsessing over footwear.
Watch the clip here.
Look Eric, this is no time for foot fetishes. We've got serious problems as a country. We've got war in the Middle East, we've got terrorists coming across our own southern border, we have an American dream that's out of reach for millions of Americans because of the Bidenflation and the high energy prices. We've got schools that are indoctrinating kids and not educating kids, and we've got cities that are being overrun by crime.
I know people want to try to divert on to other issues. I know Donald Trump and a lot of his people have been focusing on things like footwear, I'll tell you this if Donald Trump can summon the balls to show up to the debate, I'll wear a boot on my head.
This is a time for substance. This is a time for us to debate the issues that matter to the American people. And the question is: Are you able to fight for them? Which we have done in Florida. Are you able to win those fights? We have been able to do in Florida. And are you able to lead to a better tomorrow? We've done that in Florida, and we'll do that for the United States of America.
Watch the full interview here. Additional highlights from the interview below.
On the threat of China and Iran to the US:
I think you deal with people like ran through a position of strength. If you look at what Biden did when he came in, he relaxed oil sanctions on Iran. That gave them tens of billions of dollars flowing into the regime's coffers. I would turn the screws on that. I would starve their economy of money. Not just through oil, but also the snapback sanctions. I would marshal our allies to crack down on money going into Iran. Ultimately, that money is the mother's milk of Middle Eastern terrorism. We also have to look at China as being one of their main benefactors. China's buying billions of dollars worth of black market oil sales. We just rolled out our National Security Strategy last week showing that when I'm President, we're going to view China as the US's top threat, and we've got to get that one right otherwise the other stuff is not going to matter...
...So first, I think China represents the biggest threat of all those. I think Russia is basically a patron of China. Iran is basically a patron of China. Of course, North Korea depends on China. So you have to do it, one, military strength. We're going to bolster our defenses in the Pacific. I'm calling for more naval ships to deny their ability to realize their ambitions there. We're also going to do economic. We have become dependent on China for all important things in our economy almost. We need to decouple that relationship. That will be better for our security. It will not be good for China's economy. And then we've got to get serious about the cultural impact they have in the United States. I banned China from buying land in the Sunshine State. We got them out of our universities. They should not be able to be involved in that anywhere in this country. And then finally I'd say, Eric, we need to be energy dominant. Let's use our resources, oil, gas. That's bad for Russia, bad for Iran, and bad for China. The Green New Deal of Biden benefits all of those bad actors.
On his objection to blank checks:
It's got to be tied to advancing US interests, which this operation to eliminate Hamas would be, and that has got to be the justification. So, I don't support blank checks in any situation. She, of course, Nikki Haley supports a blank check to Ukraine, even though they've given Ukraine over $120 billion in less than two years. We've done $158 billion to Israel in 75 years of its existence. And yet, Biden and many of these people, you know, they want to do eventually hundreds of billions more, I think, on that. So, you have a responsibility to look after taxpayer dollars. Don't just send things willy nilly. Make sure it's tied to that objective. But I do support doing what we need to do to make sure that Israel can achieve this objective because I think it's an important military objective. I think it will help us in the Middle East to have a strong Israel. They're the only ally we could depend on through thick or thin, and this is an existential threat to their existence to have a terrorist group that wants to massacre babies and take people hostage like they have.
On how the US should support Israel:
Of course not. I mean to do a massive omnibus package is absolutely not the right way to go. So we need to support Israel in word and in deed, publicly and privately, and that means supporting their right to defend themselves, which means in this case, they have to eliminate the threat posed by Hamas. And that means eliminate the tunnels, the infrastructures, eliminate the organization. They can't live when you have a terrorist organization that wants to massacre every Jew in Israel. It's just not something you can coexist with. So they have every right to do that. It should be, like the House is doing though, it should be done mindful of the fact that we're $33-plus trillion dollars in debt. The house is taking money from the IRS to be able to give to Israel because we've got to stop adding so much debt. So I think they've been really responsible. It's also important we say no taxpayer money to the Gaza strip. That will be commandeered by Hamas. Hamas is holding Americans hostage now, as well as many other nationalities including Israelis hostage. If you're concerned about humanitarian assistance for Gaza civilians, then you should be calling for the complete and unconditional surrender of Hamas. You should be calling for them to release all the hostages. I don't see the left and I don't see the media doing any of that. And it's also important that we point out, and I've said very clearly, we cannot do what people like AOC want to do, which is import hundreds of thousands of Gaza refugees. Egypt should be taking them, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, they won't take any of these folks. You don't want to import that into the United States. People say not everyone's a member of Hamas, and I think that's true, but in the Gaza Strip, they teach all the kids to hate Jews. In the textbooks they don't have Israel even listed on the map at all. And they believe in eradicating Israel. They don't believe Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state. So we've seen all the antisemitism in our country bubble to the surface in ways that I, honestly, was surprised about, and I'm somebody in Florida, we've actually done legislation to combat antisemitism on college campuses. But you have people openly calling for the annihilation of Israel at places like Harvard and Penn and all these places. So we've got problems in our own country, and I think importing more problems is not going to help solve.

""Not only can we win the primary, but we could bring new voters... into the Great Opportunity Party and have that governing mandate that comes from a red wave."" – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott joined Stuart Varney on Fox Business to share how his optimistic, positive message is resonating with voters. Tim's contrast from his fellow candidates enables him to unite the country under conservative principles and lead Republicans to victory in 2024.
WATCH HERE
Stuart Varney: The next debate one week from today. You are in it. What's your strategy? You're coming out swinging.
Sen Scott: Well, I think it's important for us to show the contrast between our candidacy and the other candidates. The bottom line is that Nikki's too moderate. Ron's moving in the wrong direction. We are the most conservative candidate. We have the strongest message. We have clear policy positions, and not only can we win the primary, but we could bring new voters, independent voters, millennial voters, certainly minority voters into the Great Opportunity Party and have that governing mandate that comes from a red wave. We need it all if we are going to turn this nation from a nation of grievance and continue to be the nation of greatness. The radical Left wants to use any group, any issue to divide this country to hold onto their power. We can unite this country on conservative principles and lead this country to another American century. America is in the middle of a Biden retreat. We can just turn that around.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis was back in New Hampshire today as a special guest with Never Back Down, where he participated in WMUR's Candidate Café and spoke at a town hall with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Jospeh Ladapo.
At the Candidate Café, DeSantis joined Adam Sexton and New Hampshire voters for lunch and answered their questions about his agenda for the nation, as well as his baseball background and what life is like on the campaign trail.
""SEXTON: DeSantis says on the campaign trail he ends up with a lot of extra food, including baked goods. As the father of three kids under 10, he likes to save some of those goodies for them.
RON DESANTIS: But when I bring it back at 8:30 at night on a school night, and then they proceed to get hopped up on sugar, my wife is not always that happy with me for doing that. But you know, you got to, you only live once, and you deal with some of the consequences down the road.""

Then, DeSantis attended a medical freedom town hall alongside Florida Surgeon General Dr. Ladapo at The Hill Bar & Grille in Manchester. At the town hall, DeSantis was asked his stance on the United Nations:
""Defund the UN. I mean, are you kidding me? What a farce! I have a belief that we, the American people, are sovereign. We don't give up sovereignty to international organizations, and that's a long-held view... The UN is basically a hotbed for antisemitism, anti-Israel. It's some of the worst elements in the world that get together. They couldn't even bring themselves to condemn Hamas massacring all those Israeli civilians.""
Watch the full clip here.
At the town hall, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Ladapo talked about why he supports DeSantis for president.
""Can you imagine the courage it took to have all these MDs, and news experts saying that you can't open schools, people have to stay home...to stare that down, to read the data, to reach a conclusion, to know that conclusion is right, and all of these Harvard MDs and PhDs are wrong—that takes courage. And he embodies that. That is who he is.""
DeSantis' trip to New Hampshire comes on the same day that he released his first TV ad. Watch the ad here.

""Donald Trump is spending a million dollars attacking me in Iowa. Haley's Super PAC is spending big money to attack me in Iowa. You don't do that unless you view me as the threat."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined the Hugh Hewitt Show live. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On his increasing momentum in Iowa:
I can tell you this you about Iowa, you know, we looked at that poll. It did say that I have the highest favorability and the highest percentage of Iowans that are considering voting for me and I clearly have a path to win the caucus. I don't think anyone else other than me or Trump has that path based on the underlying data. But put that aside--Donald Trump is spending a million dollars attacking me in Iowa. Haley's Super PAC is spending big money to attack me in Iowa. You don't do that unless you view me as the threat. So I think it's fine. Some of the public data that gets put out--how accurate it's been over the years, I think it's definitely open to question, but look at how the campaigns behaved. And if Donald Trump hadn't showed up, he would not be spending that kind of money there. If we weren't doing well, we would not be the focal point of the attacks. And so I think what we see in Iowa is very positive. We've got 20,000 already committed to caucus, and we still have--most of the vast majority of voters haven't even made up their mind yet. So we're going to keep doing what we're doing. We've built a strong base of support. And then it's all about bringing it in for a landing as people make their decisions. But I'm just happy that because of the work we've done, we have the widest possible pool of voters to draw from of any candidate that's running, just based off that poll yesterday.
On Israel's right to defend itself to the hilt:
They're our top ally in the Middle East by far. We have a great relationship economically, culturally, all these other things. They are facing an existential threat to their existence. Hamas would wipe Israel off the entire map if they could. In fact, the textbooks that are taught to kids in the Gaza Strip do not even have Israel listed on the map. So if they don't, if they just do glancing blows, and they don't deal with this finally, then they're just going to face additional attacks in the future. We know that it'll be a vicious cycle. So just end it. We've seen, since Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2006 -- and you know, a lot of people act like Gaza is occupied by Israel, which is totally false. Israel forcibly removed a lot of its own citizens in 2006 and forced them to leave. The people of Gaza had an opportunity to make something of that. They cast their lot in with Hamas. Hamas has used money that's flowed there to build a massive terrorist infrastructure so that they could kill Israelis. And so, I agree with Senator Cotton. They got to get the job done.
On the need to secure the border and protect Americans from terrorism:
I think the problems are real for terrorism. Obviously, you have a lot of deaths from narcotics that's coming across the border, you have criminal aliens coming across the border, you have a lot of sex and human trafficking. So there's a whole mass of problems and misery that's being unleashed because of what Biden's policy at the border is. But we know that there are a certain number, 140 On Terror Watch List, that's just what the administration will admit. So there's definitely more than that. And yes, Iran has sent, other Middle Eastern countries have people coming, China, Russia. If you think about people that want to do us harm, there's no way they are going to allow that southern border to go unnoticed. That is an obvious vulnerability for this country. And of course our enemies are going to exploit it. I've said publicly, even before the Hamas attack on Israel, that there would be a terrorist attack on this country that we would be able to trace to the southern border. And I always say I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think the math lies. I think you've just had too many people have an opportunity to come in the country that mean us ill.
On the key contrasts between him and Nikki Haley:
I think on the Tuberville thing, we have a defense establishment that has let our defense industrial base atrophy. It's not up to the task of meeting the challenges, and yet they want to fund abortion tourism. So it's a total, total disgrace what they're doing, and it's right to do what Tuberville did. And of course, there are officers getting confirmed, it's just on an individual basis. The other thing I think we had a big difference on is China. She really brought Chinese businesses in when she was governor. She had given land near a military base, even, and really, this was a huge part for her economic development strategy. In Florida, we did the opposite. I banned China from purchasing land in the state, we got rid of the Confucius Institutes at our universities, and we policed the ability of China to put other money into our universities because they've done that in a lot of places. So I think we have differences there. The other thing we had a difference on, and she's attacked me over, is the whole Disney, where we had the parents' rights in education bill, the issue was should you have sexuality and transgender ideology in elementary school. Disney worked very aggressively to try to make that happen in Florida. I stood up to them and said, no, we've got to stand with the kids. She said Disney should go to South Carolina. She took their side on that. I think we've got to stand with our kids. I mean, parents need to have their rights respected in this country. And if we can't get it right on to say that it's wrong to tell a second grader that they can't just change their gender, or it's wrong to tell them they can change their gender, parents don't want that, and our society's just not going to work. So I think that's another one. Are you willing to stand up to powerful interests if it goes against the well -being of your citizens? And I've shown a willingness to do that time and time again.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Your World with Neil Cavuto,2023-10-31T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-your-world-with-neil-cavuto-0,"
""I think the House is right on this. I think what they're doing to provide robust support for Israel, while also paying for it, is the way to go."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Neil Cavuto live on Fox News Channel's Your World with Neil Cavuto. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On his support for the House GOP's Israel aid package:
I don't think that there should be a big omnibus package. I think the House is right on this. I think what they're doing to provide robust support for Israel, while also paying for it, is the way to go. Israel's a great ally of ours. We are going to support their right to defend themselves. We have a long-standing military relationship. We will continue providing them support so that they can fight and win this war. And we should all agree on that. At the same time, we're also $33-plus trillion in debt. So when you're supporting Israel, which we should do, I think what the House did to say let's pare back in other areas, that represents sound judgment. That's what the Congress should be doing when these things happen, as a matter of course. So my hope is that they can do the Israel, get that done, and I think that the American people will actually be impressed, for a change, to see Congress actually making decisions, actually having to set priorities, and helping an ally, while at the same time not continuing to bankrupt this country.
On the key differences between him and Nikki Haley:
I've been much clearer on Israel. I mean, I said from the beginning, no Gaza refugees, you know, she said that America has been able to separate terrorists from freedom fighters and that's what we have to do. Now, she backtracked on that, but I've been very clear, no refugees. I've also been very clear, canceling student visas for pro-Hamas demonstrators. I've also been very clear, no taxpayer money to Hamas. They say it's humanitarian assistance, but the reality is Hamas will commandeer that and they will use that to advance terrorism, which is what they've been doing for over a decade. So we've been leading on all those issues. We've been standing very strong for the US Israel relationship and we've really kind of set the debate I think, in a way that's been very productive and other candidates have had to follow suit from what we've said. Now her position on basically a blank check for Ukraine that is not popular with Republican voters. You know, the federal government has paid, has borrowed money to send to pay the salaries of Ukrainian bureaucrats, the pension for Ukrainian bureaucrats. And actually, if you look at Israel, 75 years of friendship, we've done about 158 billion over 75 years. The US just in the last year and a half, two years is done 120-125 billion. So those are definitely different issues and I think that voters see them differently. And that's the thing as the president, as Commander in Chief, you have to be able to take each issue as you find it, you can't have a one size fits all solution to everything. So we've been right on Israel leading the way on that, we'll continue to do that and stand strong.
On holding Iran accountable and protecting US troops:
I look at all these attacks that are going against us positions in the Middle East. And seems like Biden is has people there that are effectively sitting ducks. They're there and probably too small numbers to really do a whole lot, but they're in sufficient numbers. Were there an inviting target, and the response to those attacks has been abysmal. What they they bombed a couple empty IRGC buildings. So he's inviting more attacks against our troops. They're not doing anything to hold Iran accountable. And yes, the direct response to these attacks, and these are places like Al Assad airbase where guys like me on active duty, I mean, I was there back in the day 1515 years ago. So So that's long standing positions for US forces. But it's not just that it's he has not turned the screws on the Iranians financially since this happened. He gave them huge relief from oil revenue from the oil sanctions, Iran's gotten a lot of revenue from that he still hasn't taken back the $6 billion. So you gotta get to understand Iran is the root of all the problems for what's going on in that region. And they're not doing enough. I think that they think that they can get a deal with Iran to this day, which is not going to happen.
On his momentum in Iowa:
We're going to win Iowa and it's important. Obviously, you need to win a majority of the delegates. That's the thing. But the one thing I would point out, I mean, you know, some of these polls, even that poll in Iowa that you reference, it showed that I have the highest percentage of Iowa caucus goers who are considering me who would consider voting for me even higher than Donald Trump and then I had the highest net favorability of any by a pretty significant margin. So I think our work in Iowa has been good. We've covered a lot of the counties, we've gotten a lot of support that's been generated, and I think we've created a good impression. Now it's up to us over these next 80 days to bring that in for a landing. And when people go out to caucus that I'm the guy that they're voting for. But we start right now in this final stretch. One, we are in the in the best position in terms of our view, of how the electorate views us, and I think that that's a testament to the hard work. A lot of this stuff has not been glamorous. It's not gotten a lot of headlines. We're going to small counties, and we're meeting people and we're shaking their hand and we're answering their questions, but that's what you should do. That's the way these things are won and lost.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Patrick Bet-David for a live sit-down interview that aired on the PBD Podcast. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On the need to secure the border and protect America from terrorism:
I am worried about terrorism in America, largely because of what our own government has done to let people in illegally from all around the world. You've had almost 8 million people come in. We know people have come in from China, Russia, Middle East--all these places. There's 140 people on the terror watch list that our own government acknowledges, I mean, so you figure there's a lot more than that. And if you look at 9/11, part of the reason that happened was a failure of the immigration system too. I mean, those people did not--they weren't here on valid visas, or they had their visas expired (the hijackers). So my fear is just, you have so many people that have flooded in. Some of them are part of the drug cartels, some of them just want to work. Some of them are criminal aliens, and then some of them I think, would be potential terrorists. And I think there's going to be a terrorist attack in this country that we're going to be able to trace back to the border.
On Donald Trump's unkept promises:
Remember ""build the wall and have Mexico pay for it?"" What he now says on the campaign trail, I mean, honestly, honks me off because he says that if you believed what he said, then you're somehow a loser. That's what he said the other day, and then before he says, 'All these people saying that I'm going to have Mexico pay, there's no legal mechanism in Mexico.' Then you look at what he said in 2016. He was saying he's going to have Mexico pay. But here's the thing about execution--there actually is a way to have Mexico pay. The way you have Mexico pay is you impose fees on remittances that people send back to Mexico who work here, Central America, anywhere in the world. You'd raise billions of dollars, and you would actually be able to construct the wall. I'll tell you, I was disappointed. You know, as he's leaving office, did he use that time to fire Fauci or to do any of that? No, he actually gave Fauci an award, a presidential commendation, on January 19 2021.
On his upcoming debate with Gavin Newsom:
What it is a debate on, is about the future of the country. California represents the petri dish of American leftism. They're five years ahead of whatever Biden's people are cooking up in DC. So if you want to know what America would look like... just look to California. California is a recipe to accelerate the decline of this country. Florida is a model to reverse the decline of the country and engineer a revival of the American spirit and a new birth of freedom. And finally, the reason to debate is he might be the candidate. I mean, I think that the Republican voters, we want, we need a candidate that's going to be able to take on all comers. I mean, we look at Biden, we say he's over the hill, he's weak. And I think that's true. But they may go with Newsom, they may go with Harris, they may go with somebody else. That could happen, and we just have to be prepared for that. But it isn't because I think that necessarily he's going to be the candidate. I think it's an important debate.
On the need for real leadership in the White House:
I think what they're missing in Washington is, so much of what the party is doing is theater. You have guys out there that are that are putting on a show and that's on all sides. I mean, ultimately, these Lincoln project people, it's all about clicks for them and money and all that stuff. And it's like okay, that ultimately is not what you're judged on in terms of being a leader. You're judged on, are you actually producing results? Are you moving the electorate in a way that is going to be better? You need to unify the Republicans and you need to win enough independents. If you can't do that, you're just not going to win. And I'm the only one that really has a track record of doing that in Florida. We won independent voters by 18 percentage points. I mean, that's really what you need. But we didn't do it by contorting ourselves, or trying to put our finger in the wind. We did what we believe. We told people the truth. We delivered results. And we were able to attract people. There are people out there, they don't need to agree with you on everything. But if they see that you're telling them the truth, that they know you'll fight more when the chips are down, they will support you. So we've got to do more of that, I think as the Republicans.
On fighting the DC establishment:
I was conservative against the Republican establishment before Donald Trump ever ran. And I'm the same. You know, a lot of those people in DC, they don't they don't want me to be the candidate. They opposed me, everything we did in Florida. They opposed us having the state open, they opposed us having schools open, they opposed us fighting the vaccine mandates and stopping those. They opposed us beating Disney in the parent's rights fight. They've opposed us on getting critical race theory out of our schools, they have opposed us on banning sanctuary cities. They opposed me when we sent illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard. So that cabal of Republicans is basically a surrender caucus. They don't actually ever win victories. They're totally fine being the junior partners to the Democrats in the entrenched DC ruling class. That is totally unacceptable, and I fought those guys the whole time. I'm really the only guy that has just beat the left on issue after issue.
On Donald Trump's false attacks on Florida:
The reality is, he did that because he cared more about himself than he did about the greater good. The greater good was clearly I win reelection in Florida, we win super majorities, and we continue to implement the agenda. That's the greater good from a conservative perspective. There's no reason you should have been out there taking potshots at me, or anybody in Florida. And of course, he's trashed Florida repeatedly over the last year. He gets on social media. He said Cuomo did better in New York. I wasn't a candidate when he was doing that. He was doing that because he was upset. So it's all about him. He says Newsom did better. He said Cuomo did better. Now his whole family moved to Florida under my governorship. Put that aside, he has used very left wing media sources to say crazy things about Florida. So that's what he's done. So what is-- he's not held accountable for anything. I mean, there's a strain of people that he can go out and say whatever he wants, and somehow that's fine. And then you say anything, then all of a sudden, no, that's not the way it works. You put your big boy pants on, you're held accountable for your conduct. He chose to make those statements and that's fine. But those are false statements.

""It's not about the past...it's ultimately about how do you get in and reverse the country's decline."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined NBC's Kristen Welker live on Meet the Press today. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On how he will reverse the decline of our nation:
Here's the thing, ultimately, it's not about the past. It's not about all these other issues. It's ultimately about how do you get in and reverse the country's decline? How do we get the country back on a strong plane so that we lower prices for people, get the border secured, deal with crime in the inner cities? We need a strong leader to be able to do that, someone that can win and someone that can actually bring this in. So that's the message that we're bringing to people in Iowa, New Hampshire. And you know, when you're on the ground, you see the support building, we're doing what we need to do to be able to get the job done.
On how President DeSantis would handle the war in Israel:
I would support Israel's right to end this problem once and for all. Obviously, we have an interest in the hostages being rescued. I would work with them. I would look at the intelligence to see what our options are there. And of course, we have a strong interest there. But Israel is facing an enemy that wants nothing less than another holocaust. They would eliminate Israel from the map if they could, Hamas would drive every Jew into the sea, so I think it's important for the United States, for one of our strongest allies, that we stand with them publicly and privately in word and in deed because I think if they do anything else then eliminate Hamas entirely, they're just going to face these types of attacks again in the future.
On how he has acted to protect Jewish Floridians:
We have acted very, very swiftly and decisively. I mean, for example, after this attack, we dispatched state law enforcement working in conjunction with locals to protect our Jewish institutions, our Jewish day schools, our synagogues. There have been arrests that have been made with people that were threatening to do harm to our Jewish community. And we have some of the strongest laws on the books from anti-BDS to financial support for security of anywhere in the country. We're also one of the states that's had probably the most in-migration of Jewish residents, and we have the second highest Israeli-American population in the entire country. So, people vote with their feet. They see the type of environment we've created here that's been very strong and positive. And name me, Kristen, another governor who scrambled planes to Israel to bring them back, bring Americans back from the war zone. We did that. We got that job done. Almost 700 people we've rescued, and we're proud of stepping up and leading on that.
On decertifying collegiate pro-Hamas groups in Florida:
This is not cancel culture. This group, they themselves said in the aftermath of the Hamas attack, that they don't just stand in solidarity that they are part of this Hamas movement. And so you have a right to go out and demonstrate, but you can't provide material support to terrorism. They've linked themselves to Hamas. And so we absolutely decertified them, they should not get one red cent of taxpayer dollars. And we also have strong laws in Florida against fundraising for groups like Hamas, and we are enforcing those vigorously. It's not a First Amendment issue. That's a material support to terrorism issue.

""The proper policy for the US government should be that Israel can defend itself to the hilt."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Mark Levin for an interview on Fox News' Life, Liberty and Levin that aired tonight. The highlights are below.
Watch part one HERE and part two HERE.
On the Biden administration's lack of leadership and support for Israel:
This has been pathetic to watch the Biden administration do virtually nothing. Mark, they weren't even removing people from Israel who wanted to get back to America once the war started. I had to marshal planes from Florida. We brought back almost 700 people from Israel back to Florida, mostly Floridians, but not all, a lot of children. And then what Biden was doing, he would take some people from Israel, dump them in Greece, and then they have to fend for themselves, and then they send a bill to the people for that service. Meanwhile, you come to this country illegally, they'll fly you anywhere free of charge. They'll put you in a hotel free of charge. Heck, he sent $100 million to the Gaza Strip, which will be commandeered by Hamas. He did that very quickly. Yet our own citizens who are fleeing and wanting to get to safety, many of them who had children, he's charging them. So this is an administration that puts the American people last.
On being tough on Iran:
Biden comes in and he relaxes the sanctions. They've had billions of dollars in oil revenue flowing into their coffers. That regime is not going to use that money to benefit the Iranian people. They're going to use that money to fund terrorism in the Middle East and throughout the world, and the Hamas attack against Israel would not have happened but for the patronage of the Iranian regime. So anybody -- and oh, by the way, not only is Iran doing that, Iran is also funding Russia. So Biden's funding both sides of both of these conflicts that he's doing. So it's terrible policy. The first thing he should be doing is just tighten the screws financially on Iran. Starve them of oil revenue, starve them of financial sustenance. We actually did that, Mark, in Florida. I announced right after the attacks we are going to be expanding Iran sanctions, state-based sanctions, and we're going to do a special session of the Florida Legislature in early November. And we are going to do all that we can at the state level. And I know it's not as much heft as the US government, but hopefully other states will follow suit because the more we allow money to go to that regime, the more they're going to fund attacks against our allies and against the US if they could.
On Israel's right to defend itself to the hilt:
The proper policy for the US government should be that Israel can defend itself to the hilt. We will support it. They're not asking us to fight any wars for them. They have a strong defense. They take it very seriously, but what they need is the American President administration, in public and in private, supporting their effort to end Hamas as an entity, because if they don't end it, you're going to end up having attacks like this in the future, and how can you as a country live with these barbarians coming into your communities, massacring babies, raping women, and killing elderly people? You just can't live like that. Hamas would wipe the entire state of Israel off the map if they could. You don't have to live with a threat like that right on your border.
On why the US should not take refugees from Gaza:
Now Egypt won't take them, Jordan won't take them, Saudi Arabia won't take them, but yet the United States should have hundreds of thousands? And I said absolutely not. And yeah, the media was like, well, not everyone in Gaza is a Hamas terrorist. And I said, well, that's true, although they did elect Hamas and the people on the streets were cheering when Hamas did those attacks, and they also cheered when the Twin Towers were knocked down on September 11, 2001. But the issue is not even whether they're part of Hamas or terrorists. They teach kids in the Gaza Strip to hate Jews. They teach them that Israel should not exist and that they want to wipe Israel off the map. So why would we want to be importing those pathologies to our country? I'm not going to do that. We shouldn't do it. But people like AOC and I think Omar, they want to do that, hundreds of thousands of people like that or millions of people even, because they want to change this country to be in their image. And that will destroy the United States if they end up winning all these fights in the future.

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Launches ""Ron DeSantis Stands with Israel"" Website Detailing Strong Record on Israel",2023-10-28T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-launches-ron-desantis-stands-with-israel-website,"
WATCH: A new video promoting the website
Tallahassee, FL - Ahead of his speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Summit, Ron DeSantis launched a new website today detailing his long-standing record of supporting Israel and combatting antisemitism. The website also outlines the recent actions DeSantis has taken to fill the void of leadership in Washington following the heinous Hamas-terrorist attacks on Israel.
DeSantis has expressed unequivocal support for Israel and the Jewish people and has taken strong actions to stand by their side. While others just talk about what should be done during tough times like this, DeSantis steps up to the plate and actually delivers results.
Immediately after the Hamas attacks against Israel on October 7, Governor DeSantis enhanced protection of Florida's Jewish communities ensuring law enforcement, colleges and universities, and state attorneys received guidance on Florida's strong laws to protect Jewish communities. DeSantis increased law enforcement patrols and presence at synagogues, Jewish Day Schools, and other Jewish institutions resulting in a number of arrests over the last few weeks by law enforcement in communities and on college campuses. These actions are in addition to arrests of reprehensible Neo-Nazis over the last few months.
On October 12, Governor DeSantis issued an Executive Order requiring Florida's Department of Emergency Management (FDEM) to carry out logistical, rescue and evacuation operations for Florida residents in Israel seeking transportation back to Florida. While the Biden Administration was slow to respond and is charging Americans for using its flights, DeSantis has provided multiple passenger planes free of charge with kosher food to nearly 700 mainly Floridians to travel to America. These flights have been done in partnership with Project DYNAMO, a veteran-led nonprofit based out of Tampa.?Along with meals, Florida has provided services such as crisis counseling, comfort stations, and hygiene kits to aid in the transition. Governor and First Lady DeSantis were proud to welcome home the first plane of Floridians on October 15th.??
DeSantis sent two cargo planes with 85 pallets of key supplies to Israel that were largely donated by private parties, from drones to personal protective gear, including body armor and helmets, to medical supplies to children's toys.
DeSantis also directed Florida's colleges and universities to terminate the Students for Justice in Palestine chapters on campuses, announced a major proposal to impose the strongest state-level sanctions on Iran and Florida has taken the formal step to hold Morningstar-Sustainalytics accountable for facilitating BDS against Israel.
Additionally: DeSantis was the first presidential candidate to:

Say America should not accept refugees from Gaza to the U.S., including people with anti-Semitic, anti-American, or other toxic views who shouldn't be admitted into the country.?
Call for foreign students celebrating terrorism to have their visas canceled and be sent home and call to withhold funding from colleges and universities that promote antisemitism.?
Oppose U.S. tax dollars in assistance to Gaza that will benefit Hamas.

DeSantis also released a new video today promoting the website that will be played for the audience ahead of his RJC speech. Watch it HERE.

"Remarks to the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada",2023-10-28T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/remarks-the-republican-jewish-coalition-annual-leadership-summit-las-vegas-nevada,"
Good morning, RJC. It's always good to be here. Thank you so much for inviting me back again this year. Thank you to Matt Brooks, my really good friend Eric Levine, and all of RJC for the organization you have built. I'm not going to use my time today to give you a 25-minute policy speech.
You're welcome.
A young lady in the front said, ""Thank you so much.""
Absolutely. 48 hours after Israel was attacked, I spoke for 30 minutes at the Hudson Institute. I laid out a blueprint for reversing the Biden Policy of American weakness, retreat, and rewarding terrorism that cost innocent Americans and Israelis their lives. We need to stop spending and sending pallets of cash and unrequited love to Iran because Iran has our blood on their hands.
We need to restart the momentum of the Abraham Accords that deepened Israel's recognition in the Arab world. We need a new president and an administration that doesn't speak with a forked tongue, saying they support Israel in the day while they delay Israel at night. The last few weeks have been the clearest possible reminder. Republicans must win back the White House in 2024. But until then, I am leading in the Senate to do everything possible. Five years ago, not last year, but five years ago, I started working on anti-Semitism legislation because bigotry ain't new. Now, I'm leading on new laws to defund universities that coddle antisemitism.
I started working in May on new laws to stop Iran sanctions from sunsetting. They should stay permanent and much more. But I'm not here today to just talk about the legislation. I want to talk about something that is even deeper than policy details and even more urgent. As a Christian, I see the Jewish people as my elder brothers and sisters in faith. We all serve the one true God, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and Jacob. And the scriptures that we hold in common make one thing very clear. We have a calling, a duty to recognize evil and to confront it and call it by its name.
Proverbs says, ""He who justifies the wicked or condemns the righteous are an abomination to the Lord."" Beheading babies, raping women, burning children alive, kidnapping families from their homes. This is not a protest. It's not geopolitics. It is evil personified. Jewish people being slaughtered in their homes simply because their nation exists is not some unfortunate, complex international conflict. It is evil, and it is subhuman. When a terrorist calls his parents to brag about the Jews he has killed with his bare hands and the response from his parents are tears of joy, that is evil from the pit of hell and the poisonous antisemitism that has been allowed to fester on the radical Left in American politics is just as disgusting as well.
Our first president, George Washington, wrote a letter to a Jewish congregation. He reassured them that our brand new country would give to bigotry, no sanction, to persecution, no assistance. He said the children of Abraham would not live in fear. But now, fast forward 233 years. Today, our capital city and a university named for George Washington saw radical students being allowed to project pro-Hamas, pro-genocide propaganda that said, ""Glory to our martyrs."" They wrote Palestine from the river to the sea, praising the murderers calling for the extermination of Israel. And mark that the university did nothing. At Princeton, a crowd screaming long-lived the intifada. At MIT, anti-Semitic demonstrators demanding a ""one solution."" At the University of Washington, a Jewish student sobbed and begged administrators to do something. ""They want our people dead. She said they want us killed. How are you allowing this?"" Left-wing universities and college presidents have spent years rushing into every political controversy they can get their hands on. They've had no problem speaking up. But now that their own institutions are being used as platforms to call for genocide, now they offer pathetic equivocation or, worse, deafening silence.
They seem more offended by microaggressions than by mass murder. In the 1990s, the late Justice Scalia delivered a bone-chilling speech about the Holocaust. He said, ""We will have missed the most frightening aspect of it all if we do not appreciate that it happened in one of the most educated, progressive, cultured countries on the planet."" The Germany of the 1930s proved that a society can place all the value they want on education and credentials and elite institutions, but if we lose our moral compass, these things don't just become useless. They become dangerous. We need moral clarity. So, let's start today.
Let this echo across every college campus in America. A federal subsidy for your education is not a right. It's a privilege. A visa so foreign students can study here is not a right. It's a privilege. Do you want to know what a right is? The right of Jewish Americans to walk down the street in safety? That's a right. Do you wanna know what a right is? The right of Jewish students to study in their own college library without being suggested that you hide in an attic? That's a right. And this goes deeper than our college campuses. We have seen the footage of Israel supporters being assaulted on our streets by radicals draped in the Palestinian flag. NYPD has seen an explosion of anti-Semitic hate crimes in New York City over the last three weeks. The ADL is tracking a 400% increase spike nationwide. If this was any other minority group, hear me, If this was any other minority group, the far Left would be screaming from the rooftops, and the media would be lighting their hair on fire. Progressives say they're all about the safety and the feelings of minorities, the oppressed, the marginalized.
But when it comes to Jewish Americans who are hurting, they're silent. I can only call that one thing antisemitism, plain and simple. Call it what is. It's wrong. It's un-American. It's unacceptable. We must stand and be counted on the side of right. Our nation deserves better. Our Jewish community deserves better. America, stand up and do what's right. Don't let our friends in the community have to defend themselves. Don't let our friends in the community have to stand for themselves. The evil. But the evil extends all the way to the halls of Congress. This week, just this week, 15 radical Democrats voted against condemning the Hamas attacks, or they simply voted present.
It's hard to believe that one of them, Ilhan Omar, literally claimed that the Jewish people had hypnotized the world. How ridiculous is that? Another one of them, Rashida Tlaib, is literally an extension of the propaganda machine of Hamas. Several members of the Squad support the anti-Semitic BDS movement, a coordinated worldwide economic war of aggression against Israel. Nobody, by the way, hear me clearly... nobody is making Joe Biden put up with all this stuff. Nobody's calling, no one's stopping Kamala Harris from speaking out. Nothing's preventing Chuck Schumer from denouncing these yo-yos from the Senate floor. Nothing stopping Hakeem Jeffries from kicking them off their committees and out of their caucus.
Nothing except the fact that they only care about power. They would rather embrace antisemitism within their ranks than upset their liberal base. You know, there's a point where cowardice becomes complicity, and they're way past that point. You see, we have to cut out the rot of antisemitism from our society. We need cultural chemotherapy to fight this cancer. So, let me speak to any student who's advocating for murder and terrorism. You should be expelled from the campus. And to any student on a foreign visa who calls for genocide should be deported. You're gone! And any university, and I mean any, any university that lets itself become a megaphone for evil, should lose every single dime of federal money. Your tax dollars should not support that crap.
Anybody who marches through the streets applauding the killing of Americans and Israelis should be considered unemployable. They won't work in my office. And any member of Congress who gives one ounce of aid, comfort, or support to terrorist killers through their words, their actions, or their affiliation with groups like the DSA should be expelled from office immediately. Let me tell you why, though. If you support Hamas, you are in violation of your oath of office. Period. Let me close with this. It's very simple to me. In Genesis, God creates light, and he calls it good, and he divides the light from the darkness. That is our mission. That is our charge. That is the blessing we can be to the world. We can separate the darkness from the light. We can call evil by its name and overcome it.
You know, people ask who will stand in the gap for the Jewish people? I say I will stand in the gap for the Jewish people. I will stand alone. I will stand with two. I will stand with a hundred. I will stand in the gap for the Jewish people. You shouldn't have to stand for yourself. I will take that on. Who will fight the cancer of antisemitism on college campuses? We will. Who will reclaim our streets for peace and patriotism? We will. And let me tell you why. The book of Isaiah chapter 62, is a prophet's prayer for Israel. ""Because I love Zion, I will not be silent. Because my heart yearns for Jerusalem, I cannot be silent. I will not stop praying for her until her righteousness shines like the dawn and her salvation blazes like a burning torch."" My friends, may we be messengers of that light. May we be ambassadors of God's mercy to the good, but may we also be instruments of his justice to the wicked. You see, good will triumph, and evil will fail. Hamas and its allies need to feel the wrath of God. And I dare say, I dare say, may they meet the wrath of God with some American military hardware. Send them on their way. God bless. Stay strong, stay safe, and let's win this fight.

LAS VEGAS, NV – Today, Senator Tim Scott delivered a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition's Annual Leadership Summit.
Since the evil terrorist attacks against Israel earlier this month, Tim has been the leading voice in holding Hamas and any of its supporters accountable. Tim has unapologetically called out the anti-semitism on college campuses and in Congress.

WHAT THEY ARE SAYING:
Semafor's Shelby Talcott: Tim Scott gets a big standing ovation after his RJC speech, where he focused in part on college campuses and anti-semitism. He also called out Democratic lawmakers like Ilhan Omar & Rashida Tlaib, whose names were met with boos from the crowd.
Washington Free Beacon's Alana Goodman: Senator Tim Scott going off at RJC this morning. Strongest speech I've ever seen from him. ""Any student advocating for murder or terrorism, you should be expelled from the campus.""
Breitbart's Joel Pollack: If you haven't seen it yet, you really must watch Senator Tim Scott's address at  RJC, taking on antisemitism. Probably the most powerful speech about it, by anyone, in recent memory.
Post-Gazette's Jonathan Salant: Senator Tim Scott brings RJC Summit to their feet as he preaches, ""The right of Jewish Americans to walk down the street in safety is a right.""
The Messenger: Weaving biblical scripture into his speech, Scott, a Christian, struck a decidedly Old Testament tone with a modern flourish when he closed his speech.
""May we be ambassadors of God's mercy to the good. But may we also be instruments of his justice to the wicked,"" Scott said.

Well, hello RJC. I bring greetings from the Free State of Florida. It's great to be back and see so many friendly faces. I just wish it were under a little bit different circumstances because I think the last few weeks have been an incredibly difficult time for us all, not just our friends in Israel, but people all throughout the United States of America.
On October 7, we witnessed a level of barbarity that had really been unforeseen -- that had not been seen in recent decades. I remember dealing with al Qaeda in Iraq when I was serving on active duty, we remember the horrors of ISIS. What they did, what these Hamas terrorists did, by butchering babies, by mutilating people, by taking elderly hostage, this reached a new depth for the depravity of mankind. And make no mistake about it, this was the most deadly attack against Jews since the Holocaust itself. And if these barbarians had their way, they would try to do a second Holocaust right in our own time. That is the stakes of what we are facing with the Hamas attack on the people of Israel.
And I know it's been personal for a lot of people here. It's been personal for my wife and I. In Florida, of course, we have one of the strongest Jewish communities in the country, one of the strongest Israeli-American communities in the country. And what we saw is the personification of evil. That's what it was. And I just think about, there's a story that I was told where you had an IDF reservist who had gotten activated. And so, he missed the Brit Milah of his son, so they had to do it over zoom. So he's there on zoom on the phone, and he's pronouncing the blessings as that's going on. And then at the end, he offered a concluding prayer. The prayer thanked God for giving him the life to see this moment, even though it was under less than ideal circumstances. And I just thought to myself, doesn't that just tell you the difference? Israel values life. The Hamas terrorists worship death. Don't tell me there's a moral equivalency here because there is not.
And I don't care what imbeciles on college campuses say, I don't care what liars in the media say, I don't care what reprobates at the United Nations say, we stand with Israel. We stand with the people of Israel. The United States will have their back. We will give them what they need so that they can defend themselves. And that means not just a couple of glancing blows, that means a complete and total victory in this conflict. Hamas must be no more at the end of this conflict.
Now when the news of this happened, I instinctively knew that this was going to be very important for the state of Florida, just with the connections that we have, with the people of Israel, the Jewish communities that we have in our own state. So we didn't just sit and lead through mere words. We took action to protect the people of our state in any way that we could. We activated special quick response forces for Florida Highway Patrol. We put Florida Department of Law Enforcement out in full force to protect our Jewish institutions, our synagogues, our day schools, Holocaust museums. They've already been able to rack up a number of arrests of people who were violating the law. But we've made it very clear in the state of Florida. If you mess with our Jewish community, we are going to hold you accountable.We also knew that there were a lot of people that were struggling to be able to get out of the conflict. Many Floridians, but also many other Americans, and yet the State Department was no help, The US Embassy in Jerusalem was no help. The Biden administration was dragging its feet, so we decided to take action. We issued an executive order, and we provided planes to send to Israel and to bring people back to the United States to safety.
And how sad is it that the best the Biden administration could do was to dump people in Greece, they have to just somehow find a way home from Greece, and then the Biden administration sent them a bill for the trip to Greece. But you know, if you come across our border illegally, Biden will fly you all over this country free of charge. He'll put you up in hotels free of charge. But if you're an American leaving Israel, he's going to stick you with the bill. So we sprung into action, and we got it done. We've now rescued close to 700 Americans -- mostly Floridians, but not all because we're all Americans.
My wife and I met the first plane load that arrived in Florida, this is now a couple of weeks ago, and it was 271 people that they were able to bring back. 91 of them were children. So as we're waiting there at the foot of the of the stairs from the plane, you know, you see a mother and a father with four kids, the pet family dog all coming down. And I'll never forget, one of the mothers came up to me, pointed to her six year old daughter -- and my wife and I, we have a six year old daughter -- and she said, all my daughter has been saying for the last two days is mommy, I don't want the rockets anymore. I don't want the rockets anymore. I just want the state of Florida. I want Florida. Well, we made it happen. We brought them back to the state of Florida.
We also looked and saw, it was really appalling what's happened in so many American universities in response to the Hamas terrorist attacks. Before the blood was even dry on the Israeli civilians who were massacred, you had college students going out and demonstrating in favor of Hamas. And I was the first presidential candidate to say, and I know a lot of them have now said the same, but no one, you know, I'm always first and then people kind of follow through. That's how we've governed Florida, and that's how we are in this. But I said very clearly that when I'm President, if you are in our country on a student visa and you're making common cause with Hamas, I am canceling your visa, and I'm sending you home where you belong.
We also saw the rise of these chapters called Students for Justice in Palestine. And this is a group that took pains to say that they don't, quote, stand in solidarity with what Hamas did, that they are one in the same with what Hamas did. Well, you know, you may have a First Amendment right to say a lot of dumb things, but you do not have a right to give material support to terrorists. So we deactivated the Students for Justice in Palestine in the state of Florida. It's done. And we're not going to put up with this. I'm sick of funding our enemies. We're not doing that anymore in this country.
But it raises -- and yes, we're happy to take action in Florida, but if you look, and if you looked at some of the university presidents in Florida and the statements they put out, they weren't morally equivalent. They were very strong. That's what it should be, yet that was so rare as to what was going. You now have in most of these universities, if you're a Jewish student, you don't feel safe even going to class in some of these places. Do you want to go to Cooper Union with how they handled that? This has been disgraceful, but it's been very eye opening because I got through both Harvard and Yale and came out more conservative than when I went in. And that's not easy to do. I know campus leftism, I've been there, but even in my day, I would have never saw that type of activism where you're actually celebrating terrorists and openly being antisemitic. This is like something that, and the media doesn't care when they're doing it. They give them a free ride when they're doing it.But what it raises is how sick these universities have become because they've been captured by ideology. They've been captured and corrupted by a woke agenda. Anytime these institutions become corrupted by that they become useless for us. And in Florida, we've taken action on that. This whole thing of DEI -- diversity, equity, and inclusion -- that's anti-Israel, it's anti-Jewish 100% if you take that to the logical conclusion. The way it's practiced, DEI is really discrimination, exclusion, and indoctrination. That has no place in our public universities. And in Florida, we have banned in from our public universities. It's done. But we need to take this seriously because it's only going to get worse unless we do for the country what we've done in Florida, and that is very simple. It's time for us to fight back, and fight back we must.Florida was also the first state to announce that I'm calling the legislature back in for a special session in the next couple of weeks, we are going to expand our state based sanctions against the Iranian regime. We already have some of the strongest in the United States, we now have an ability to expand those because the money that's going into Iran, they're not using it to make the lives of their people better. They're using it to fund terrorism throughout the Middle East. So we're standing up and we're doing what's right. And again, this is about leading not with mere words, but deeds. And we've done that time and time again. Now the other thing that I thought of and I thought close to home when I saw the attack, the other thing I and millions of Americans started to think of was, well, if Hamas can do that to Israel, which has very strong border security, what's going to happen in our country, where they've led almost 8 million people come in illegally. And they're not all coming from Mexico and Central America, they've come from Iran, they've come from China, they've come from Russia, they've come from the Middle East, in very, very large numbers. I always say I hope I'm wrong about this, but I don't think the math lies, there's unfortunately going to be a terrorist attack in this country in the ensuing years that we'll be able to trace back to what's happening at the border. So we are in an age in which terrorists wants to strike this country. So as President, I'm going to deal with the border on day one, we're going to declare it to be a national emergency, I'm sending the military to the border, I'm stopping the invasion, when you come in illegally, I'm sending you home, you got to go back to the country you came from.I am going to build the wall and I actually will have Mexico pay for it. And here's how you do it. Because I thought I mean, I thought it was very important to do the wall, we need it. This would not be happening at this level if we had a fully constructed wall, the way you make Mexico pay for it. You don't just say give me money. Of course, you're not going to do that you do, and we will do impose fees on the remittances that people send back to Mexico and Central America and other places, you'll raise billions of dollars. And we will construct that border wall and we will get it done. We're also going to recognize that part of the reason we have the problem at the border, the Mexican drug cartels are eating our lunch. They are killing tens of thousands of our fellow Americans, because of fentanyl overdoses. There are Angel moms all across this country who have lost children because of fentanyl overdose. And yet Biden just sits there and goes to the beach in Delaware, we are going to take action as commander in chief, you not only have a right, you have a duty to fight back against people that are invading your country and killing your people. And we will use deadly military force against the Mexican drug cartels. We're not putting up with it anymore.
I was also the first candidate to say that we in the United States cannot accept refugees from the Gaza Strip. And here's the thing. We got to start looking at these issues with clear eyes. Political correctness will end this country if we don't stop doing it. And I said you don't want the Gaza. And what they said was, well, they're not all Hamas. Well, look, they elected Hamas. Let's just be clear. They were cheering for Hamas when Hamas perpetrated this attack, just like they cheered when Al Qaeda knocked down the Twin Towers. They were cheering Palestinian Arabs when that happened. So it does. The question isn't whether you're all Hamas. The question is, do they teach young kids to hate Jews? Yes. Do they teach young kids that Israel should be wiped off the map? Actually, do they even have Israel in the map on their textbooks? No, it's not even there. So it's not a question of whether you're actually a terrorist or whether you're a member of Hamas or not. We can't vet all this stuff out. What I do know is if you bring in hundreds of thousands like people like AOC and the squad want, you will be importing toxic ideology and the pathologies of the Gaza strip into our own country. That is not what the American people deserve. It is not in the American people's interest to do that.
And so we've got to get smart about how we handle who comes into our country. Europe, what they have done by bringing massive amounts of people into their country, from the Middle East over the last 10 or 15 years, have those people assimilated into what--? No, they're bringing the same blood feuds that they're leaving in the Middle East, and they're replenishing them in places like Britain, in places like Germany. Germany, has more antisemitism today than at any time since Adolf Hitler and it is because they've been reckless with who they've led into this country. So no more political correctness. We've got to be smart about what we're doing. And we can't be importing problems from other parts of the country, particularly when you hate Jews and you don't want Israel to exist. I'm not taking you in, if that's your position, so just be clear.
Now, part of the reason we're here is because we have a president that is failing on all fronts. What did Biden do when he became president? He loosened the screws financially on the Iranian regime. Now, you know that Iran's the leading state sponsor of terrorists in the world, we just commemorated earlier this week, the 40th anniversary of the Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, they killed more Marines, Iran through Hezbollah in 1983 in that one bombing that at any time since Iwo Jima, they killed hundreds of our service members when I was serving on active duty in Iraq, during the Iraq Campaign, and maybe even killed over a thousand. Hamas and Hezbollah would not even exist in their current form, if it wasn't for Iran. So when you go easy on Iran, you know, they're going to turn that money around and plow it into terrorism. And now what is Iran doing? Biden's got US troops in the Middle East. I'm not sure what their mission is. He hasn't been very clear on that. I do know that they're sitting ducks. I know that Iran is attacking them. What is Biden do in response? He attacks some buildings. That's not an appropriate, that's not a sufficient response. So he's going to get some people killed--.[AUDIO CUTS] Israel's right to defend itself. They have a right to go full tilt, we should not be saying one thing in public. And then restraining in private. Biden needs to toughen up, and he needs to get our allies back. He also wants to send money to the Gaza Strip. They say it's humanitarian assistance. But we know Hamas will take that assistance, and Hamas will use it to their own purposes. They didn't build all those terror tunnels with their own money. They commandeered his assistance over many, many years, and plowed it into terrorism, while some of their own people suffered. That's exactly what's going to happen if you keep sending money down there. We also need Biden and his ilk, to stop with the phony narratives. Stop trying to say that it's incumbent upon Israel to adopt a quote, two state solution. You can you please explain to me, how are you supposed to have a two state solution with people that don't believe in your right to exist as a Jewish state? It doesn't happen. You can't do it. You hear people say Gaza is quote, occupied. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. They forcibly uprooted their own citizens out of Gaza. It is not occupied by Israel. They chose to throw their lot in with Hamas and misery has followed as a result, but they could have chosen a better path. We also are not going to accept the canard that somehow Judea and Samaria are occupied territories. They're disputed territories, but they are the most ancient Jewish lands going back to biblical times. So when you have these numbskulls on college campuses, saying that Israel is somehow a colonial power, no, no, no, the Jews were the ones originally that had the connection to the land. That's the opposite of colonialism. Read your history, read your Bible.
Finally, we have to fight back against media lies. The media lied about that Gaza hospital. That was not Israel that did it. That was a form of blood libel, quite frankly. But we're going to see more of this in the future. And we just got to say, we're not going to accept the fake narratives. We're not just going to bow down to whatever they're spewing. We're going to think critically, and we're going to fight back against the lies coming out of the media. So I think it's just important, before I conclude, you know, there's tropes out there about, oh, why do people support Israel and all this stuff? Let me just tell you, my support of Israel's because it's in the United States's national interest to support Israel. They're the most dependable ally we have, in a very troubled part of the world. Anything that happens there, they will have our back, there's no one else in the Middle East that you can say that. They're the only country in that region that shares our values. They're a Western country, they believe in free speech and democracy, and human rights. They also share, we have a lot of affinities back and forth with our people and their people and it's something that's been very great and has blossomed over these last 75 years in particular. It's also just the fact that we would not be here today as Americans were it not for what took place in the Holy Land thousands and thousands of years ago. The Judeo Christian tradition, is what Western civilization was built on. It was what this country was built on. And they are the caretakers of that important piece of land. So those are reasons why we support Israel.
Now, here's the thing, we're going to continue to have bad outcomes unless we change horses and have new people elected to leadership. Yes, the presidency. But up and down the ballot, our country is in a state of decline. I don't think that decline is inevitable. I think that the client has a choice. It's a choice that we as Americans are going to make over the next year, year and a half. I refuse to wave the white flag of surrender. I refuse to accept merely managing the client the decline a little bit better than the Democrats as being adequate to what faces us now, we need a full reversal of American decline. We need an American revival, a new birth of freedom in this country that will bring us back to where we belong. 2024 though is make or break, there's no mulligan's, no excuses. We have to get the job done. There is no substitute for victory. What we've shown in the state of Florida, is if you lead boldly, if you deliver big results, you can win over a lot of voters who never even voted Republican in their past. Heck, I won Miami Dade County by double digits. We won Palm Beach County, for the first time in 40 years as a Republican, we got the highest percentage of the Jewish vote of any Republican running for governor, it can be done.
The final thing I'll say is this. The reason why I'm running and motivated in this fight is I have a six a five and a three year old at home, we are in danger of being the first generation of Americans to leave to our kids and grandkids and America less prosperous and less free than the America we inherited. And that would be breaking faith with every generation of Americans up until the present time who've always labored and sacrificed so that the future generations would have the opportunity to be free. I'm a military veteran, I was just in DC again, and we were able to, we flew into Reagan airport and I've taken this a number of times, but as you're going in, you can sometimes fly right by the National Mall. You see the Lincoln Memorial, Washington all these great memorials and monuments that make you feel special as an American because that represents freedom and our ideals and everything that makes us unique. But every time I do that, I always make sure to look out the other side of the plane. Because the best monuments to freedom this country has aren't on our National Mall. If you look over the Potomac River from the Mall, you see a series of small nondescript monuments orderly arranged over the rolling hills of a place called Arlington National Cemetery. It occurred to me again yesterday, you can have the best constitution in the world, you can have the best Declaration of Independence in the world, these things do not run on autopilot. They require people to step up and defend freedom when it's threatened and sometimes put on a uniform, risk your life and indeed give the last full measure of devotion for service to this country. Now, we're not called upon to make those types of sacrifices. But we are called upon to stand firm for truth. We're called upon to hold our ground, not back down in the face of the left. And I can promise you this as your nominee for the Republican Party, I will deliver a big victory in November of 2024. As a leader, as a leader, I will always be somebody that you can be proud of. And as your President, I promise you this, I will not let you down. Thank you all. God bless you. Thanks so much. Thank you. God bless you RJC. On to victory in 2024. We did in Florida, we can do it all across these United States.

Remarks on Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation,2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/remarks-foreign-policy-the-heritage-foundation,"
Thank you to the Heritage Foundation for hosting me today. Thanks to Dr. Kevin Roberts for the great work you have done since taking the helm. You know, whenever I see the establishment launching attacks against the Heritage Foundation, I know you guys must be doing something right. So just keep up at it and keep on going. During my six years serving in the Congress, I worked very closely with Heritage on a number of issues, but particularly issues relating to national security matters. I came to Congress on the heels of having served in uniform in Iraq during the post-Saddam period of conflict, a time when US troops faced attacks from both Sunni jihadists like al Qaeda in Iraq but also Shia militias that were funded and directed by the mullahs in Iran. And those Iranian militias were responsible for killing hundreds if not over a thousand of American troops. I knew that the suboptimal outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan represented a failure of US national security policy. I also believed as I arrived in Congress that neither post 9/11 neo-conservatism, which represented a departure from traditional Reagan-esque peace through strength policies, nor the fecklessness of the Obama administration, which merely invited hostility from America's adversaries were desirable vessels for a successful national security strategy. So my approach was to stress the need to do a number of things one, for American strength to deter our enemies. Two, to protect our own borders and enforce American sovereignty. Three, to ensure that US foreign policy served the interests first and foremost of the American people. Next, to avoid plunging America into any ill-defined or unnecessary conflicts and rejection of ceding American sovereignty to international organizations like the United Nations. Now in Congress, we lead on issues that matter when it came to the nation's national security. I was one of the leading opponents of the Obama-Khamenei Iran nuclear deal, and we were instrumental in pointing out the flaws of that disastrous policy. As the chairman of the National Security Committee on House Oversight, we exposed a lot of the flaws in this nation's Afghanistan policy and did that in ways that were really embarrassing for a lot of policymakers. I served six years on House Foreign Affairs, and I was one of, if not the leading advocate for pro-Israel policies such as relocating our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty of the Golan Heights, combating the boycott, divestment, and sanction movement and seeking to defund entities like Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
I was also one of the voices in Congress sounding the alarm against Hamas terrorism and Israel's need to finally deal with that, as well as the nefarious influence of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood. We combated Marxism in the Western Hemisphere in places like Cuba and Venezuela. We understood and made it an issue to treat our border security as a national security issue. We also highlighted the dangers of domestic terrorism and the role that immigration plays in fueling that terrorism. Now, since I took the helm as governor of Florida, we have been engaged in a lot of these important issues. We lead the fight in Florida, against Airbnb's BDS policies against the State of Israel. And as a result of that, Airbnb reversed course. We've expanded academic and economic ties with the State of Israel. We've bolstered relationships between Florida and Japan, and Florida and South Korea. We sent law enforcement and the National Guard to the southern border to help Texas do what the federal government has failed to do. And we also sent illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard, which put the issue on the front burner in ways that no other single action has done.
More recently, we arranged for the rescue of close to 700 Americans from Israel following the Hamas terrorist attacks, the State Department, the embassy, they weren't doing what needed to be done to get Americans back home. Eventually, they said they'll dump you in Greece and then charge you for that. And I thought to myself, you know, if you come into this country illegally, they don't charge you to fly you all over the place. They put you in hotels, they don't charge the illegal alien that but yet Americans fleeing a war zone, somehow they're going to get a bill? It isn't right. And then more recently we deactivated Students for Justice in Palestine in our Florida University system.
They are a group, which publicly says that they don't just stand in solidarity with Hamas, that they are part of what Hamas is doing. That is material support to terrorism and that is not going to be tolerated in the state of Florida and it should not be tolerated in these United States of America. So we're proud of what we've been able to do as governor.
But as we look across the world now, we are a nation adrift. The Biden foreign policy is rudderless, weak, misguided, and solicitous of America's adversary. Just think of some of the things that have happened in just these two and a half years. The Afghanistan withdrawal dishonors the sacrifices of our service members, and they abandoned billions worth of military equipment to the Taliban. Biden has empowered Iran with sanctions relief that has fueled the Hamas attacks, that has fueled what Russia is doing in Europe. Biden also invited the Russian aggression against Ukraine by displaying weakness and even publicly stating that a small invasion would be a-okay. Biden's placed ideological ambitions like the Green New Deal over American energy dominance and independence, that have helped America's adversaries Iran, China, Russia, Venezuela. Biden has also sacrificed strong policy against the CCP, which we need in favor of climate talks in a summit with Xi Jinping, all the while China provides patronage to Russia and to Iran. This is just the fact American power is on the decline. This has been happening for some time, but it is accelerating under the Biden administration. As we sit here today, we've learned some hard lessons and the post-Cold War world. We've seen the limits and indeed futility of trying to impose democracies on foreign cultures. We understand the perils with nation-building and social engineering in foreign lands. We've seen military adventurism go awry such as the Obama, Hillary, Libya escapade. We've seen the ruling class in this country empower China for a generation. They had promised most favored nation status would lead to a more democratic China, that we would be able to have enforceable rules to protect our technology and intellectual property. China has been empowered as a result. And then, of course, most recently, the Chinese COVID virus that came from the Wuhan lab, American policymakers had a disastrous response to that which has weakened this country dramatically.
After the Cold War, we were the only superpower, it was a Unipolar Moment. Some people even said that we had witnessed the end of history, that it would be America standing alone, I think, wiser heads knew that that was not something that could last indefinitely. September 11, 2001, ushered in an era in which nonstate actors were viewed as the primary threat to US security and the United States just launched a global war on terrorism, with some successes, but also some failures. Where are we now? Well, now we're back in an age of great power rivalry. We are in an age in which we now have a peer competitor, and that competitor is the Chinese Communist Party. And it's something that we have to face, and we have to have policy that's going to be able to protect the American people from the looming China threat. We currently lack the leadership necessary to confront these current challenges. Part of the problem lies in a failure to even articulate, 'what are we trying to accomplish?' Regarding our nation's security, you certainly don't get a lot of clear thinking in many parts of this town. Our national security decisions must be guided by a number of clear and important factors.
First and foremost, you've got to put the American people first. The idea that it's even distinguishing to say, you want a national security strategy that puts America first shows you how far astray we must have gone with some of this stuff. Of course, that's your obligation to put your own country first. The protection of the lives, safety, and security of our people and the sovereignty of our nation is the fundamental duty of our federal government. This means both guarding against domestic attacks and achieving enforceable, secure borders. Another factor that's important is protecting the economic and material well-being of America. Ultimately, our military strength is rooted in economic strength. We're not going to be strong abroad if we are not strong at home. Third, we've got to protect the American way of life. This means not only the protections against the predations of foreign nations, but also foreign nonstate actors, as well as threats that can come domestically. Ensuring that we have an immigration system that strengthens America's culture rather than undermines it is a key part in preserving this American way of life.
Now, the use of national power cannot be based on the fluff or ill-defined objections that have marked DC foreign policy for decades. Power must be rooted in concrete objectives that the US is seeking to achieve through political, economic, and if necessary, military avenues, but we cannot succumb to Wilsonian abstractions. We cannot expand the people's treasure, much less spill our citizens' blood with murky missions or misguided agendas. When we act, we will act decisively, and we will achieve the goals that we set out to achieve. There will be no better friend to allies than the United States of America, we must work constructively with these nations with whom we have shared interests. But we also have a clear-eyed, no-nonsense approach to America's enemies. Those who seek to harm the United States of America will have no worse enemy than the United States of America. National security policies, of course, must be commensurate with the ability to carry it out. As a republic, the policies we pursue must engender sustained public support from the American people. And as a veteran of the Iraq War, I recognize the gravity of deploying US troops in combat, and I hope to never have to do that as commander in chief. But if such a duty calls, I will ensure that the US will be fully committed to winning. Our armed forces will have what they need to be lethal and capable, preferably to deter conflict in the first place, but also to achieve a decisive, overwhelming victory if conflict arises.
So where do we find ourselves now? Chaos abounds, dangers are gathering, America lacks direction, and leadership is in short supply. The world is getting more dangerous as conflicts mount. We have a major national security issue in our own country at our own southern border. We've had 7 to 8 million people pour into this country illegally since Joe Biden took office. They are not all coming from Mexico and Central America, they are coming from all over the world, from the Middle East, from Russia, from China. Do you think for a minute that America's enemies are not taking advantage of that porous southern border? So dealing with that border is not just the right thing for the United States in terms of the rule of law and our economy? It is a national security issue, and it's one that we need to tackle. The Hamas terrorist attack against Israel raises yet another front in global conflict. How did this happen? It happened because Iran funded and orchestrated the attack against the people of Israel. This is the most deadly attack, terrorist attack on record. And there were more Jews killed on October 7, than at any time since the Holocaust. We just commemorated last week, the 40th anniversary actually, this week, the 40th anniversary of the Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983. That attack was done, orchestrated by Hezbollah and the Iranians to kill Americans. And when I was in Iraq, Iran was killing our troops left and right. So they have a long history of fomenting Jihad throughout the Middle East and killing not just Jews, but Americans. It's important that we say as Americans that Israel has the right to fully defend itself against these barbarous attacks. You can't just sit there and have a terrorist group on your border, who's going to behead your babies, rape women, and massacre elderly people, and think that you can do a glancing blow and somehow that's going to take care of it. They need to end Hamas once and for all and we should be supportive of that not just publicly, but also in private not just in words, but also in our deeds. It's important that we do.
The Hamas attacks against Israel have taken some of the focus off the war in Europe. Biden invited the Russian invasion of Ukraine through his weakness. And now his policy is basically seeking a blank check to continue a policy that has no identifiable end game. Biden is also funding both sides of this conflict. His deferential posture to Iran has given them billions of dollars in sanctions relief, they have plowed that not just for terrorism in the Middle East, they're also plowing it into helping Russia with things like drones. And his Green New Deal policies also benefits Russia, which relies on energy production. Now Heritage has correctly pointed out how it is in America's interest to bring this conflict to an acceptable conclusion, to stop the decimation of our weapons reserves, and to focus our forces where they are most needed and I think that is the right approach and I commend Heritage for saying it. And so what is the right approach? Where are our forces needed? China is the key player behind both of those foreign conflicts. The CCP is keeping both Iran and Russia afloat financially. China's purchasing massive amounts of Iranian oil on the black market, thereby enriching the mullahs. And Russia is selling China gas and much, much more. And that is bolstering Russia's war machine. Now lengthy conflicts, particularly between Russia and Ukraine will ultimately benefit China, because it will distract America and it will deplete our already dwindling Western weapons and ammunition stockpiles. The threat posed by the CCP requires our primary focus and attention right now. They are the first truly peer competitor that we have dealt with in our lifetimes. If you look back at the World War Two, the Allied Powers had a much stronger economy than the Axis powers. If you look at the comparison between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the economic comparisons, not even close. The US economy was so much more robust than the Soviet Union, yet China's near-peer competitor to ours economically, they're close to us militarily. They have a lot of leverage over our economy, because all the interconnectedness that has happened over these last many decades, largely due to bad decisions made to America's ruling class. And China has grand ambitions. They seek to be the dominant power in the entire world, and they are marshaling all their society to be able to achieve that objective. So this is a formidable threat and it requires a whole of society approach.
The next President United States must have the focus and determination to see major policy changes through. You cannot be focused on short-term political considerations, you have to do what's right, and you have to get the job done. Why is this something that we should care about? Well, look, I mean, I want to be the top country. I mean, I want to be number one in everything we do, which is kind of competitive. But that's not the crux of it. A world that's dominated by the CCP will see them export their authoritarian vision all across the world. This will be a world marked by Internet policing, artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and social credit scores, it will end up creating a global dystopia. This is a regime that you do not want to have control or influence over our society. After all, the death toll of the CCP regime, since it sees power in 1949, may very well be the highest of any government in history, it numbers in the tens of millions, many of that at the hands of Mao Zedong. And of course, China was responsible for the COVID-19 virus and pandemic and they tried to hide it and they put the rest of the world in great peril. And yet they've never been held accountable for any of that. So the United States has to treat the threat posed by the CCP the same way we treated the threat posed by the Soviet Union. We understood that the Soviet Union was trying to export communism around the world. And so we took our whole national security apparatus, and we tailored it to be able to meet that first and foremost threat. We have to recognize when we do this, resources are scarce. You have to set priorities when you're determining the proper national security posture for the United States. If you say that you can simply defend everything at once, you end up defending nothing. So I will reorient US foreign policy to prioritize the Indo-Pacific region as the most pressing part of the world for defending US interest and US security. Now, some say it's inevitable that the East win will prevail over the West win, that the 21st century will be somehow a Chinese century, and that America will continue its descent.
I'm here to tell you, decline is not inevitable. Decline is a choice. We cannot raise the white flag of surrender. We have time to get this right. But time is running out. Just as we don't want to be mired in pessimism and accept the idea of an inevitable American decline. We also can't be diluted with happy talk, decline will not be averted by looking at our situation through rose-colored glasses, telling Americans that everything is fine, and that there is no limit to what we can presently do. That type of happy talk is as off base as the notion that decline is inevitable. So our goal from a national security perspective vis-à-vis the CCP is very simple. We win and they lose.
So how do you do this? You got to do a number of things. First, we will modernize and bolster our military capability to deter CCP aggression. Peace can only be achieved through strength. Sometimes people say you deter China by worrying about this part of the world or that part of the world. My view is a little bit more simple, if you want to deter China deter China. What they will respect is strength, particularly strength in their region, we must have adequate hard power to deny China's ambitions vis-à-vis Taiwan, as well as the first island chain. As Winston Churchill noted, it's important to keep open and active the saltwater highways that make our world tic and to that end, I'm proposing a Four Oceans Navy. 355 ships by the end of the first term. 385 by the end of the second term, and a pathway for 600 ships within the next 20 years. That will be hard power that will make a difference. That will be hard power that will preserve the peace.
With respect to Taiwan, we need the training and capability to deter CCP aggression. And we need to place first in line for purchasing advanced weapons and munition, Taiwan. This is the hotspot, and we need to be there and help defend. We also have to reform and slash the bloated defense bureaucracy. We want agile innovation, quick integration of commercial technologies, we want to be able to rapidly address the pressing needs of this nation's national security policy. And then finally, we need a major overhaul of this country's defense industrial base, it is lagging and it is causing huge vulnerabilities for this country.
Second thing we need to do is unleash America's full economic potential and prevent the CCP from surpassing us as an economic power. First on that list, we are going to open up our domestic energy resources for production, whether that's federal land, whether that's permitting pipelines, whether that's Alaska, we need to open it all up. I want to be the dominant energy producer in the world by a country mile. We will choose Midland over Moscow, we will choose the Marcellus over the Molas, and we will choose Bakken over Beijing, and that will give us a great competitive advantage as a result. We also need to expand domestic mining and mineral processing of key rare earth minerals. Biden wants to force everybody to do an electric vehicle, which then will make us more dependent on China because they're the leader in producing these minerals. But then when we have our own deposits here, he takes that out of circulation and he won't let that be mined. We need to be doing the opposite, reversing the EV mandates of course, but also doing the mining that we need to be able to make our country stronger. We need to enact tax trade and regulatory policies designed to secure critical supply chains and to effectuate a strategic decoupling of the US economy from China and from the CCP. We must forcefully counter malicious CCP economic behavior, and we have to leverage our alliances in the free world versus the CCP. We could perhaps fend the CCP off just one versus one, but if we have the entire Free World on our side, that is going to give us a huge competitive economic advantage over China.
Third thing we have to do is ensure robust technological dominance in fields like robotics, quantum computing, artificial Intelligence, biotech, and blockchain. I want more money, less money going to left-wing universities, more money for R&D through our defense department. I want new players in the defense space. We shouldn't just have a handful of the same companies that we rely on to meet our defense needs. We also need to reform export controls, and work with our allies so that we're building supply chains and technology free from the CCP's malicious influence.
Fourth thing we need to do, we have to defend the homeland against CCP influence and that means we cannot have an open border. We know that there have been a large number of Chinese nationals that have come across the southern border over the last two and a half years. We need to put a stop to it, and that'll be a day one national emergency issue for me. We also need to do what we did in Florida. We need to stop allowing the CCP to purchase land near farm, take farmlands, near their military bases. In Florida, we banned China from buying land outright in our state because I don't think it's in our interest to have them gobbling up land near critical infrastructure or our farmland. We also have to take domestic intel and law enforcement agencies and revamp them. They are not serving this country well. We've had a lot of problems. We need new leadership and we need a lot of accountability in those agencies. We have to take steps to make sure that our electric grid is resilient, and that our cybersecurity defenses are as up-to-date as possible. We'll also combat malign CCP influence in education like we did in Florida,. We eliminated the so-called Confucius Institutes from our K through 12, or from our higher education system. And we cracked down on the ability of China to pour money into our state university system. We need to do that nationwide. China has been very smart about how they get into some of these crevices in our society. And we basically let them do it. The time for that is over. And of course, this follows from the border, but it'll be more than just securing the border, we've got to take action to stop China-derived fentanyl from ravaging American communities. We're losing tens of thousands of our fellow Americans every year. The precursor chemicals are made in China and shipped to the Mexican drug cartels.
Finally, we will stand for individual liberty and human dignity, expose CCP oppression, we need to give hope to those chafing under authoritarian rule.
At the end of the day, China has a lot of liabilities. They have a lot of weaknesses. They want to maintain ironclad control over their population indefinitely. And there's cracks in that and there will increasingly be more cracks in that because they are not doing what needs to be done for individuals to ultimately flourish.
So this is the decisive decade, we are in jeopardy of being the first generation of Americans to leave to our kids and grandkids in America less prosperous and less free than the one we have inherited and that would be breaking faith with every generation of Americans leading up to the president if we allow that to happen. So we must arrest our country's decline. Now in affairs both foreign and domestic, we're called upon to preserve what George Washington called the sacred fire of liberty. This is the fire that burned an Independence Hall when 56 men pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to establish a nation conceived in liberty. It's a fire that burned at a cemetery in Gettysburg, when the nation's first Republican President pledged this nation a new birth of freedom. It's a fire that burned among the boys who stormed the beaches of Normandy to liberate a continent and to preserve freedom throughout the world. It's the fire that infused the young preacher's dream relayed at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial right down the street from here, that the Declaration of Independence said what it meant and meant what it said, that all men are created equal. It's the fire that led a resolute president to stand in Berlin in front of the Brandenburg Gate and say, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,' staring down communism and ultimately winning the Cold War. So it is our responsibility to carry this torch. We do not run from this responsibility. We welcome this responsibility. And by tackling these challenges head on, we will ensure that the 21st century will in fact be an American Century. Thank you all and God bless you. Thank you. Thanks so much.

""You threaten my country, there will be consequences in your country... there should be targets in Iran that we have already chosen to tell Iran a clear message: You threaten our lives, it will cost you yours.""–  Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott joined America's Newsroom this morning to call out the Biden Administration's weak record on Iran.
WATCH HERE
Bill Hemmer: What would you do about Iran?
Sen Scott: Well, number one, let's go back a couple of months when we had the president of Iran on our soil, calling for the death of members of President Trump's administration. Number two, we now have the foreign minister threatening America. They should not be allowed back on our soil. They did it while being guarded by our secret service. They should have a swift reaction from this administration.
If I were president, the one thing I would say, you threaten my country, there will be consequences in your country. We know that 90% of the money Hamas used to butcher Israelis and Americans came from Iran. We should make sure that while we can see their fingerprints, Iran's fingerprints on this war, the blood from Americans and Israelis are on their hands. The consequences must be steep and they should be met swiftly. We should never say when we're gonna do it, but without any question, there should be targets in Iran that we have already chosen to tell Iran a clear message. You threaten our lives, it will cost you yours as well....
I can tell you though, that this relationship predates October 7th. You think about the fact that in this administration, Biden's administration wanted the Russians to negotiate with the Iranians on our behalf for a new nuclear deal. We saw the release of sanctions that allowed more than $80 billion of energy resources to flow into Iran. And then of course, the hostage negotiation that brought another $6 billion to Iran. I don't know what this administration does not understand that you cannot make a good deal with a bad actor, and you certainly cannot make it with the world's greatest sponsor of terrorism by state. I don't understand Joe Biden. We need to fire Joe Biden and hire me. That's how we make the change that is necessary.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Fox and Friends,2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-fox-and-friends,"
""If you harm American servicemembers, you should have hell to pay."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Brian Kilmeade on Fox and Friends live. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On his upcoming foreign policy plan:
We're going to unveil a whole-of-government approach to deal with what really is our top threat, the Chinese Communist Party. If you look what's happening in Gaza and Israel and Hamas, you know, that's all funded by Iran. Who's Iran's leading benefactor right now with the black market oil sales? China. You look at Russia and Ukraine, who's Russia's main benefactor? China. Who represents a peer competitor to us militarily and increasingly economically? China. We're back in an era of great power rivalry after the end of the Cold War and the age of terrorism. We still have a lot of other threats, but we've got to get the China issue right. And so, I'm going to have a policy that's going to get that job done.
On Joe Biden's rudderless foreign policy:
I think Joe Biden is a fierce opponent of the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. He's been that for a long time. And he uses these as an example, as a pretext to advance an agenda he always wants to do. Look, this guy in Maine, we're going to get more information. Hopefully, they catch him soon. He's obviously very dangerous. He had a mental health intervention. This is not just a run of the mill, law-abiding American, and something happened that he was still allowed to be out there. So focus on the individual, rather than trying to nuke the rights of every law-abiding citizen. And then on the Syria strikes, Brian, it seems to me we've got troops there, it's not clear to me that we have enough troops to really make an impact with whatever they're trying to do. And yet, we have enough troops to where they're going to be able to be targets. And so, they're kind of sitting ducks there. I don't know what the strategic objective of them being there is. But this is an example of, I think, Biden's rudderless foreign policy.
On protecting our kids in schools:
You we had the Parkland shooting the year before I became governor, so I became governor and I took the lessons from that and the recommendations, and we've created really strong school security, we have SROs in every school, we have different layouts to make it so that they're hard targets and not soft targets. We've put over a billion dollars into that. I'm a parent of a six, five, and a three year old. Trust me, that school security is very, very important. But to go to millions of Americans and blame them for this stuff -- that's not the way to do it. Also, Brian, I'd say this, you look a lot of the guys who commit violent crime, and yes, less than what we saw in Maine, a lot of these people go in and out of the justice system because of liberal soft-on-crime policies. You do a crime, you should do the time. Stop cycling people back out. That will make communities safer, and Biden doesn't want to do that.
On supporting American troops:
If you harm American servicemembers, you should have hell to pay. Now, I'm not sure Biden's policy with how he's deploying those troops is the right one. He's not really articulated why that's there. It seems like the risks are better than the benefits in terms of that, but put that aside, wherever our troops are, if you're taking potshots at them, you better be prepared to get return fire. We're not going to let our troops be sitting ducks.
On his upcoming debate with Gavin Newsom:
It is set for November 30 on Fox News, and I saw him over there groveling with Xi Jinping and I thought to myself, you know, these are two guys who locked down their people, violated their rights, you know, imposed medical authoritarianism, and really hurt their societies. And they both had really the same playbook with respect to COVID-19.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Releases Foreign Policy Plan,2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-releases-foreign-policy-plan,"
Tallahassee, FL - During a speech at The Heritage Foundation today, Ron DeSantis outlined his vision for a foreign policy that prioritizes and protects America's vital interests. DeSantis' foreign policy recognizes that the Chinese Communist Party presents the greatest threat to America and centers around one idea: ""We Win and They Lose."" As president, DeSantis will ban China and other adversaries from purchasing farmland and property near critical infrastructure and military installations, rebuild America's navy, and unleash America's full economic potential to prevent the CCP from surpassing America as an economic power.
DeSantis said during his speech:
""Chaos abounds, dangers are gathering, America lacks direction, and leadership is in short supply The world is getting more dangerous as conflicts mount...
""We've seen the ruling class in this country empower China for a generation...I'm here to tell you, decline is not inevitable. Decline is a choice. We cannot raise the white flag of surrender. We have time to get this right. But time is running out. Just as we don't want to be mired in pessimism and accept the idea of an inevitable American decline. We also can't be diluted with happy talk. Decline will not be averted by looking at our situation through rose colored glasses telling Americans that everything is fine...
""Our goal from a national security perspective vis-à-vis the CCP is very simple. We win; They lose.""

Remarks on Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation,2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/remarks-foreign-policy-the-heritage-foundation,"
Thank you to the Heritage Foundation for hosting me today. Thanks to Dr. Kevin Roberts for the great work you have done since taking the helm. You know, whenever I see the establishment launching attacks against the Heritage Foundation, I know you guys must be doing something right. So just keep up at it and keep on going. During my six years serving in the Congress, I worked very closely with Heritage on a number of issues, but particularly issues relating to national security matters. I came to Congress on the heels of having served in uniform in Iraq during the post-Saddam period of conflict, a time when US troops faced attacks from both Sunni jihadists like al Qaeda in Iraq but also Shia militias that were funded and directed by the mullahs in Iran. And those Iranian militias were responsible for killing hundreds if not over a thousand of American troops. I knew that the suboptimal outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan represented a failure of US national security policy. I also believed as I arrived in Congress that neither post 9/11 neo-conservatism, which represented a departure from traditional Reagan-esque peace through strength policies, nor the fecklessness of the Obama administration, which merely invited hostility from America's adversaries were desirable vessels for a successful national security strategy. So my approach was to stress the need to do a number of things one, for American strength to deter our enemies. Two, to protect our own borders and enforce American sovereignty. Three, to ensure that US foreign policy served the interests first and foremost of the American people. Next, to avoid plunging America into any ill-defined or unnecessary conflicts and rejection of ceding American sovereignty to international organizations like the United Nations. Now in Congress, we lead on issues that matter when it came to the nation's national security. I was one of the leading opponents of the Obama-Khamenei Iran nuclear deal, and we were instrumental in pointing out the flaws of that disastrous policy. As the chairman of the National Security Committee on House Oversight, we exposed a lot of the flaws in this nation's Afghanistan policy and did that in ways that were really embarrassing for a lot of policymakers. I served six years on House Foreign Affairs, and I was one of, if not the leading advocate for pro-Israel policies such as relocating our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty of the Golan Heights, combating the boycott, divestment, and sanction movement and seeking to defund entities like Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
I was also one of the voices in Congress sounding the alarm against Hamas terrorism and Israel's need to finally deal with that, as well as the nefarious influence of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood. We combated Marxism in the Western Hemisphere in places like Cuba and Venezuela. We understood and made it an issue to treat our border security as a national security issue. We also highlighted the dangers of domestic terrorism and the role that immigration plays in fueling that terrorism. Now, since I took the helm as governor of Florida, we have been engaged in a lot of these important issues. We lead the fight in Florida, against Airbnb's BDS policies against the State of Israel. And as a result of that, Airbnb reversed course. We've expanded academic and economic ties with the State of Israel. We've bolstered relationships between Florida and Japan, and Florida and South Korea. We sent law enforcement and the National Guard to the southern border to help Texas do what the federal government has failed to do. And we also sent illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard, which put the issue on the front burner in ways that no other single action has done.
More recently, we arranged for the rescue of close to 700 Americans from Israel following the Hamas terrorist attacks, the State Department, the embassy, they weren't doing what needed to be done to get Americans back home. Eventually, they said they'll dump you in Greece and then charge you for that. And I thought to myself, you know, if you come into this country illegally, they don't charge you to fly you all over the place. They put you in hotels, they don't charge the illegal alien that but yet Americans fleeing a war zone, somehow they're going to get a bill? It isn't right. And then more recently we deactivated Students for Justice in Palestine in our Florida University system.
They are a group, which publicly says that they don't just stand in solidarity with Hamas, that they are part of what Hamas is doing. That is material support to terrorism and that is not going to be tolerated in the state of Florida and it should not be tolerated in these United States of America. So we're proud of what we've been able to do as governor.
But as we look across the world now, we are a nation adrift. The Biden foreign policy is rudderless, weak, misguided, and solicitous of America's adversary. Just think of some of the things that have happened in just these two and a half years. The Afghanistan withdrawal dishonors the sacrifices of our service members, and they abandoned billions worth of military equipment to the Taliban. Biden has empowered Iran with sanctions relief that has fueled the Hamas attacks, that has fueled what Russia is doing in Europe. Biden also invited the Russian aggression against Ukraine by displaying weakness and even publicly stating that a small invasion would be a-okay. Biden's placed ideological ambitions like the Green New Deal over American energy dominance and independence, that have helped America's adversaries Iran, China, Russia, Venezuela. Biden has also sacrificed strong policy against the CCP, which we need in favor of climate talks in a summit with Xi Jinping, all the while China provides patronage to Russia and to Iran. This is just the fact American power is on the decline. This has been happening for some time, but it is accelerating under the Biden administration. As we sit here today, we've learned some hard lessons and the post-Cold War world. We've seen the limits and indeed futility of trying to impose democracies on foreign cultures. We understand the perils with nation-building and social engineering in foreign lands. We've seen military adventurism go awry such as the Obama, Hillary, Libya escapade. We've seen the ruling class in this country empower China for a generation. They had promised most favored nation status would lead to a more democratic China, that we would be able to have enforceable rules to protect our technology and intellectual property. China has been empowered as a result. And then, of course, most recently, the Chinese COVID virus that came from the Wuhan lab, American policymakers had a disastrous response to that which has weakened this country dramatically.
After the Cold War, we were the only superpower, it was a Unipolar Moment. Some people even said that we had witnessed the end of history, that it would be America standing alone, I think, wiser heads knew that that was not something that could last indefinitely. September 11, 2001, ushered in an era in which nonstate actors were viewed as the primary threat to US security and the United States just launched a global war on terrorism, with some successes, but also some failures. Where are we now? Well, now we're back in an age of great power rivalry. We are in an age in which we now have a peer competitor, and that competitor is the Chinese Communist Party. And it's something that we have to face, and we have to have policy that's going to be able to protect the American people from the looming China threat. We currently lack the leadership necessary to confront these current challenges. Part of the problem lies in a failure to even articulate, 'what are we trying to accomplish?' Regarding our nation's security, you certainly don't get a lot of clear thinking in many parts of this town. Our national security decisions must be guided by a number of clear and important factors.
First and foremost, you've got to put the American people first. The idea that it's even distinguishing to say, you want a national security strategy that puts America first shows you how far astray we must have gone with some of this stuff. Of course, that's your obligation to put your own country first. The protection of the lives, safety, and security of our people and the sovereignty of our nation is the fundamental duty of our federal government. This means both guarding against domestic attacks and achieving enforceable, secure borders. Another factor that's important is protecting the economic and material well-being of America. Ultimately, our military strength is rooted in economic strength. We're not going to be strong abroad if we are not strong at home. Third, we've got to protect the American way of life. This means not only the protections against the predations of foreign nations, but also foreign nonstate actors, as well as threats that can come domestically. Ensuring that we have an immigration system that strengthens America's culture rather than undermines it is a key part in preserving this American way of life.
Now, the use of national power cannot be based on the fluff or ill-defined objections that have marked DC foreign policy for decades. Power must be rooted in concrete objectives that the US is seeking to achieve through political, economic, and if necessary, military avenues, but we cannot succumb to Wilsonian abstractions. We cannot expand the people's treasure, much less spill our citizens' blood with murky missions or misguided agendas. When we act, we will act decisively, and we will achieve the goals that we set out to achieve. There will be no better friend to allies than the United States of America, we must work constructively with these nations with whom we have shared interests. But we also have a clear-eyed, no-nonsense approach to America's enemies. Those who seek to harm the United States of America will have no worse enemy than the United States of America. National security policies, of course, must be commensurate with the ability to carry it out. As a republic, the policies we pursue must engender sustained public support from the American people. And as a veteran of the Iraq War, I recognize the gravity of deploying US troops in combat, and I hope to never have to do that as commander in chief. But if such a duty calls, I will ensure that the US will be fully committed to winning. Our armed forces will have what they need to be lethal and capable, preferably to deter conflict in the first place, but also to achieve a decisive, overwhelming victory if conflict arises.
So where do we find ourselves now? Chaos abounds, dangers are gathering, America lacks direction, and leadership is in short supply. The world is getting more dangerous as conflicts mount. We have a major national security issue in our own country at our own southern border. We've had 7 to 8 million people pour into this country illegally since Joe Biden took office. They are not all coming from Mexico and Central America, they are coming from all over the world, from the Middle East, from Russia, from China. Do you think for a minute that America's enemies are not taking advantage of that porous southern border? So dealing with that border is not just the right thing for the United States in terms of the rule of law and our economy? It is a national security issue, and it's one that we need to tackle. The Hamas terrorist attack against Israel raises yet another front in global conflict. How did this happen? It happened because Iran funded and orchestrated the attack against the people of Israel. This is the most deadly attack, terrorist attack on record. And there were more Jews killed on October 7, than at any time since the Holocaust. We just commemorated last week, the 40th anniversary actually, this week, the 40th anniversary of the Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983. That attack was done, orchestrated by Hezbollah and the Iranians to kill Americans. And when I was in Iraq, Iran was killing our troops left and right. So they have a long history of fomenting Jihad throughout the Middle East and killing not just Jews, but Americans. It's important that we say as Americans that Israel has the right to fully defend itself against these barbarous attacks. You can't just sit there and have a terrorist group on your border, who's going to behead your babies, rape women, and massacre elderly people, and think that you can do a glancing blow and somehow that's going to take care of it. They need to end Hamas once and for all and we should be supportive of that not just publicly, but also in private not just in words, but also in our deeds. It's important that we do.
The Hamas attacks against Israel have taken some of the focus off the war in Europe. Biden invited the Russian invasion of Ukraine through his weakness. And now his policy is basically seeking a blank check to continue a policy that has no identifiable end game. Biden is also funding both sides of this conflict. His deferential posture to Iran has given them billions of dollars in sanctions relief, they have plowed that not just for terrorism in the Middle East, they're also plowing it into helping Russia with things like drones. And his Green New Deal policies also benefits Russia, which relies on energy production. Now Heritage has correctly pointed out how it is in America's interest to bring this conflict to an acceptable conclusion, to stop the decimation of our weapons reserves, and to focus our forces where they are most needed and I think that is the right approach and I commend Heritage for saying it. And so what is the right approach? Where are our forces needed? China is the key player behind both of those foreign conflicts. The CCP is keeping both Iran and Russia afloat financially. China's purchasing massive amounts of Iranian oil on the black market, thereby enriching the mullahs. And Russia is selling China gas and much, much more. And that is bolstering Russia's war machine. Now lengthy conflicts, particularly between Russia and Ukraine will ultimately benefit China, because it will distract America and it will deplete our already dwindling Western weapons and ammunition stockpiles. The threat posed by the CCP requires our primary focus and attention right now. They are the first truly peer competitor that we have dealt with in our lifetimes. If you look back at the World War Two, the Allied Powers had a much stronger economy than the Axis powers. If you look at the comparison between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the economic comparisons, not even close. The US economy was so much more robust than the Soviet Union, yet China's near-peer competitor to ours economically, they're close to us militarily. They have a lot of leverage over our economy, because all the interconnectedness that has happened over these last many decades, largely due to bad decisions made to America's ruling class. And China has grand ambitions. They seek to be the dominant power in the entire world, and they are marshaling all their society to be able to achieve that objective. So this is a formidable threat and it requires a whole of society approach.
The next President United States must have the focus and determination to see major policy changes through. You cannot be focused on short-term political considerations, you have to do what's right, and you have to get the job done. Why is this something that we should care about? Well, look, I mean, I want to be the top country. I mean, I want to be number one in everything we do, which is kind of competitive. But that's not the crux of it. A world that's dominated by the CCP will see them export their authoritarian vision all across the world. This will be a world marked by Internet policing, artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and social credit scores, it will end up creating a global dystopia. This is a regime that you do not want to have control or influence over our society. After all, the death toll of the CCP regime, since it sees power in 1949, may very well be the highest of any government in history, it numbers in the tens of millions, many of that at the hands of Mao Zedong. And of course, China was responsible for the COVID-19 virus and pandemic and they tried to hide it and they put the rest of the world in great peril. And yet they've never been held accountable for any of that. So the United States has to treat the threat posed by the CCP the same way we treated the threat posed by the Soviet Union. We understood that the Soviet Union was trying to export communism around the world. And so we took our whole national security apparatus, and we tailored it to be able to meet that first and foremost threat. We have to recognize when we do this, resources are scarce. You have to set priorities when you're determining the proper national security posture for the United States. If you say that you can simply defend everything at once, you end up defending nothing. So I will reorient US foreign policy to prioritize the Indo-Pacific region as the most pressing part of the world for defending US interest and US security. Now, some say it's inevitable that the East win will prevail over the West win, that the 21st century will be somehow a Chinese century, and that America will continue its descent.
I'm here to tell you, decline is not inevitable. Decline is a choice. We cannot raise the white flag of surrender. We have time to get this right. But time is running out. Just as we don't want to be mired in pessimism and accept the idea of an inevitable American decline. We also can't be diluted with happy talk, decline will not be averted by looking at our situation through rose-colored glasses, telling Americans that everything is fine, and that there is no limit to what we can presently do. That type of happy talk is as off base as the notion that decline is inevitable. So our goal from a national security perspective vis-à-vis the CCP is very simple. We win and they lose.
So how do you do this? You got to do a number of things. First, we will modernize and bolster our military capability to deter CCP aggression. Peace can only be achieved through strength. Sometimes people say you deter China by worrying about this part of the world or that part of the world. My view is a little bit more simple, if you want to deter China deter China. What they will respect is strength, particularly strength in their region, we must have adequate hard power to deny China's ambitions vis-à-vis Taiwan, as well as the first island chain. As Winston Churchill noted, it's important to keep open and active the saltwater highways that make our world tic and to that end, I'm proposing a Four Oceans Navy. 355 ships by the end of the first term. 385 by the end of the second term, and a pathway for 600 ships within the next 20 years. That will be hard power that will make a difference. That will be hard power that will preserve the peace.
With respect to Taiwan, we need the training and capability to deter CCP aggression. And we need to place first in line for purchasing advanced weapons and munition, Taiwan. This is the hotspot, and we need to be there and help defend. We also have to reform and slash the bloated defense bureaucracy. We want agile innovation, quick integration of commercial technologies, we want to be able to rapidly address the pressing needs of this nation's national security policy. And then finally, we need a major overhaul of this country's defense industrial base, it is lagging and it is causing huge vulnerabilities for this country.
Second thing we need to do is unleash America's full economic potential and prevent the CCP from surpassing us as an economic power. First on that list, we are going to open up our domestic energy resources for production, whether that's federal land, whether that's permitting pipelines, whether that's Alaska, we need to open it all up. I want to be the dominant energy producer in the world by a country mile. We will choose Midland over Moscow, we will choose the Marcellus over the Molas, and we will choose Bakken over Beijing, and that will give us a great competitive advantage as a result. We also need to expand domestic mining and mineral processing of key rare earth minerals. Biden wants to force everybody to do an electric vehicle, which then will make us more dependent on China because they're the leader in producing these minerals. But then when we have our own deposits here, he takes that out of circulation and he won't let that be mined. We need to be doing the opposite, reversing the EV mandates of course, but also doing the mining that we need to be able to make our country stronger. We need to enact tax trade and regulatory policies designed to secure critical supply chains and to effectuate a strategic decoupling of the US economy from China and from the CCP. We must forcefully counter malicious CCP economic behavior, and we have to leverage our alliances in the free world versus the CCP. We could perhaps fend the CCP off just one versus one, but if we have the entire Free World on our side, that is going to give us a huge competitive economic advantage over China.
Third thing we have to do is ensure robust technological dominance in fields like robotics, quantum computing, artificial Intelligence, biotech, and blockchain. I want more money, less money going to left-wing universities, more money for R&D through our defense department. I want new players in the defense space. We shouldn't just have a handful of the same companies that we rely on to meet our defense needs. We also need to reform export controls, and work with our allies so that we're building supply chains and technology free from the CCP's malicious influence.
Fourth thing we need to do, we have to defend the homeland against CCP influence and that means we cannot have an open border. We know that there have been a large number of Chinese nationals that have come across the southern border over the last two and a half years. We need to put a stop to it, and that'll be a day one national emergency issue for me. We also need to do what we did in Florida. We need to stop allowing the CCP to purchase land near farm, take farmlands, near their military bases. In Florida, we banned China from buying land outright in our state because I don't think it's in our interest to have them gobbling up land near critical infrastructure or our farmland. We also have to take domestic intel and law enforcement agencies and revamp them. They are not serving this country well. We've had a lot of problems. We need new leadership and we need a lot of accountability in those agencies. We have to take steps to make sure that our electric grid is resilient, and that our cybersecurity defenses are as up-to-date as possible. We'll also combat malign CCP influence in education like we did in Florida,. We eliminated the so-called Confucius Institutes from our K through 12, or from our higher education system. And we cracked down on the ability of China to pour money into our state university system. We need to do that nationwide. China has been very smart about how they get into some of these crevices in our society. And we basically let them do it. The time for that is over. And of course, this follows from the border, but it'll be more than just securing the border, we've got to take action to stop China-derived fentanyl from ravaging American communities. We're losing tens of thousands of our fellow Americans every year. The precursor chemicals are made in China and shipped to the Mexican drug cartels.
Finally, we will stand for individual liberty and human dignity, expose CCP oppression, we need to give hope to those chafing under authoritarian rule.
At the end of the day, China has a lot of liabilities. They have a lot of weaknesses. They want to maintain ironclad control over their population indefinitely. And there's cracks in that and there will increasingly be more cracks in that because they are not doing what needs to be done for individuals to ultimately flourish.
So this is the decisive decade, we are in jeopardy of being the first generation of Americans to leave to our kids and grandkids in America less prosperous and less free than the one we have inherited and that would be breaking faith with every generation of Americans leading up to the president if we allow that to happen. So we must arrest our country's decline. Now in affairs both foreign and domestic, we're called upon to preserve what George Washington called the sacred fire of liberty. This is the fire that burned an Independence Hall when 56 men pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to establish a nation conceived in liberty. It's a fire that burned at a cemetery in Gettysburg, when the nation's first Republican President pledged this nation a new birth of freedom. It's a fire that burned among the boys who stormed the beaches of Normandy to liberate a continent and to preserve freedom throughout the world. It's the fire that infused the young preacher's dream relayed at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial right down the street from here, that the Declaration of Independence said what it meant and meant what it said, that all men are created equal. It's the fire that led a resolute president to stand in Berlin in front of the Brandenburg Gate and say, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,' staring down communism and ultimately winning the Cold War. So it is our responsibility to carry this torch. We do not run from this responsibility. We welcome this responsibility. And by tackling these challenges head on, we will ensure that the 21st century will in fact be an American Century. Thank you all and God bless you. Thank you. Thanks so much.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on the Victor Davis Hanson Show,2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-the-victor-davis-hanson-show,"
""American freedom will be eroded if the 21st century becomes a Chinese century."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Victor Davis Hanson for an interview on the Victor Davis Hanson Show that aired today. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On combatting threats from China and Iran:
Iran has sold China huge amounts of oil. So China is sending money to Iran. Of course, Iran uses those profits to fund terrorism. China's also buying a lot of gas from Russia. They're supporting Russia's ambitions in Eastern Europe. So all of this stuff ultimately goes back where China is playing a role in empowering these belligerent actors. And China's, also, I think a threat for those reasons, but also taking a step back. Their economy is close to a peer economy of ours. You know, I don't think they've caught us yet, but on current paths, it's possible that they will in a decade. Some people say maybe even less than that. Their military may not be a peer with us now, but they're gaining, and they have the second most powerful military in the country... We've got to deny their ability to realize their ambition in the Indo-Pacific, which requires more hard military power, which I will support. We're actually going to lay this out later this week. It does require us to reevaluate this economic relationship and to not be dependent on China for so many important things. And then it requires us to take seriously their power within the United States of America. I mean, for example, in Florida, I've signed laws banning China from buying land in the state of Florida. We don't want them buying farmland, some of these other things. So I think it's going to be a whole of society approach that is going to be necessary so that we remain the world's preeminent power. And it's not just so we beat our chest and anything like that. American freedom will be eroded if the 21st century becomes a Chinese century.
On Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas:
Israel's lived under these rockets for how many years? Now, you have this brutal massacre. Are they just supposed to sit there and have a ceasefire, knowing that these Hamas butchers, they would butcher every single Israeli if they could. That's their ultimate goal. So we need to have moral clarity on this. Israel has every right to defend itself to the hilt. And that means eliminating Hamas as a threat entirely, which yes, it means you're going to have to go into Gaza. They'll have to go into Gaza. They'll have to uproot the tunnels. They're going to have to take out all the terrorist infrastructure. But that's another thing, Victor, that these college campuses and the far left, they act like the Gazans are suffering under, quote, occupation, but Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. They forcibly removed Israeli citizens from there. It was a very traumatic event, but the idea was let the Gazans do kind of what they wanted. It's actually a very nice stretch of coastline. Did the people of Gaza tried to make the most of that and maybe create like a Singapore on the Mediterranean? No, they elected Hamas. And when people say in the media, oh, well, not every Gazan likes Hamas. Yeah, maybe not. But you know, a lot of them were cheering on October 7 when this happened. And that's just what we're dealing with here. And so I think the administration, to send $100 million in, quote, humanitarian aid, knowing that we'll be commandeered by Hamas, just how quick they are to send that money there, how slow they are to do things to support our own people like our border and all these other issues, it is ideology. This is kind of leftism run amok, I fear.
On shutting down pro-terrorist student groups:
Now on the campuses, I will say if you looked at how Harvard administration responded, Penn, some of these others, it was just horrendous how they did it. If you looked at like the University of Florida's President's statement, and some of our other universities, it was a much different posture. I mean, they were very clear in terms of this was terrorism, this is wrong, there's no moral equivalence. Very clear that they weren't going to let Jewish students, just people just take potshots at them because they're Jewish. And so, I was proud that our universities stepped up and handled it, I think, the way we would want universities to handle it. And probably even 20, 30 years ago, as liberal as some of them were then, I would not have seen, at places like Harvard or Yale, somebody go out and actually make common cause with Hamas terrorists when the blood isn't even dry off these Israeli civilians. Yet, that's what we saw. So in Florida, our chancellor of our university system and our Board of Governors, this Students for Justice for Palestine, they have said, by their own admission, they're not just advocates or cheerleading on Hamas, they are part of this movement. They have said that publicly. And you can say what you want in the United States, but you can't provide any type of support for terrorism. And when they say that they're one in the same with Hamas, that is unacceptable to be on our college campuses. And so those groups are going to be deactivated in the state university system.
On the need to put American interests first:
I think that the DC foreign policy elite, they've stubbed their toe so many times that the proper approach to the world is one through American strength, absolutely, but it cannot go get mired into some of the George W. Bush, kind of, quote, freedom agenda where we were going to do a lot of intervention to promote, you know, more esoteric concepts when applied to some of these other areas. And I'd say the same thing with the neoliberal left. You know, they're hyper-interventionist when it's not obvious that it's in our interests. They want us to try to be, quote, humanitarians. And that just doesn't work. But the notion that somehow somebody like me, who actually has served to these conflicts, I was on House Foreign Affairs for six years, we got involved in all these issues. But I think we did it in a way that we've been vindicated. And I think if you look at what I did back then, I'm the same guy today as I was. We're going to have a strong America. We're going to deter conflict. We're going to ensure that we're identifying the appropriate threats. But we're also going to exercise prudence in how we're wielding American power. And we're not going to get us bogged down in conflicts that ultimately drain our resources for no concrete objective achieved.
On his plan to secure the border and keep terrorists out of America:
We'll declared a national emergency on day one that'll free up resources, I'll send the military there will stop the invasion, we're not going to allow the asylum claims we'll do remain in Mexico, we will build the wall, we will I will actually have Mexico pay for the wall. Now, Mexico is not just going to cough up money. But what you do, the way to realize that promise from Trump in 2016 is to impose fees on the remittances that people send back to Mexico and Central America and all over the world. you'd raise Billy, even a small fee, you'd raise billions of dollars a year, we would be able to construct a wall, we will do that people that come I've said I've pledged that every one that's come in under Biden, we're going to send back we will deport you have to do that if you're not willing to do that, you're never ultimately going to get the situation under control and the amount of people that have come from hostile countries, China, Russia, Iran, other parts of the Middle East, it's been a lot of people, there are people on the terror watch list that have come in. So you absolutely have to do that. And we will do that we'll lean in against the Mexican drug cartels treating them as akin to foreign terrorist organizations authorizing the use of force when they're breaking into our country with the fence at all. I'm just going to take care of them and that will change their behavior, but they're killing a lot of our people.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: Deport Foreign Nationals On Campuses Who Encourage Genocide And Murder,2023-10-26T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-deport-foreign-nationals-campuses-who-encourage,"
""The attacks on our Jewish brothers and sisters have to stop.""  – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Tonight, Tim Scott joined Rob Schmitt on Newsmax to rebuke the radical Left's refusal to call out anti-Semitism in their party. Tim called for the expulsion of students on visas advocating for terrorism on campus and the defunding of schools using tax dollars to platform hate.
WATCH HERE
Rob Schmitt: I can't believe in lower Manhattan, we're seeing signs celebrating the Hamas attacks. But we are. What's your plan for these people that are just atrocious people?
Sen Scott: It's just unbelievable to see the level of hate and disgusting behavior from people in our country. And I would say to every single person who's come to our country on a student visa who finds themselves protesting on college campuses. When they're shouting for Jewish genocide, when they're advocating for mass murder and when they're supporting terrorism, go home. We should deport these kids on college campuses who are encouraging genocide, who are encouraging murder, and who are supporting terrorism. We have no place on our college campuses. And frankly, for those colleges and universities who cannot figure that out, we should remove the federal funds. We Americans do not want our tax dollars supporting terrorism. We do not want our tax dollars giving a platform for genocide. We refuse to use American tax dollars for those who believe in mass murder, especially on university and college campuses where those administrations refuse to do so because they're more interested in the tuition than they are truth...
There's no doubt that when you look at the brass tacks, what we've learned over the last several months, and frankly the last two weeks, is that the radical Left, they're willing to weaponize race. They're willing to weaponize any single issue, any group of people, to maintain their political power. That's why they refuse to bring the Squad in and say ""either you get in line or we expel you from the House,"" take away your committee assignments. They're so afraid of speaking the truth to the Squad and to anti-Semitic individuals in their party that they're just silent. Silence makes you complicit with the very comments that we hear ringing around the nation. I'm having Jewish friends, business owners coming in looking for ways to secure and fortify their businesses. The attacks on our Jewish brothers and sisters has to stop. And you shouldn't have to be Jewish to stand in the gap for common sense, decency and for truth. That's America. We stand for freedom.

""[Donald Trump] is missing in action right now. He doesn't show up. When he does show up, he reads off the teleprompter for 50 minutes, and then he gets back on the plane and goes home."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined CNN's The Source with Kaitlan Collins. The highlights are below.
Watch part one HERE and part two HERE.
On the importance of standing with Israel and helping American hostages:
I think the most important thing is to stand with Israel, both publicly and privately, and back their ability to wipe Hamas out. Go to the hilt, uproot the tunnels, do everything they need to do to make sure this never happens again. That's the most important thing. And I think that's pretty much what they want. Now, I don't think it's necessarily America's fight. I think we should support Israel. How we get involved -- now, clearly, we have an interest with the hostages that are there, some of whom are American, and I would work with Israel to be able to recover those folks. And I'm not sure what Biden's using those people for. I do know, he's got people in Iraq and Syria who are being targeted by Iran. They're kind of just sitting ducks. I'm not sure that that's the best policy either... But those hostage rescue efforts are, those very sensitive things as a very high risk maneuvers. But clearly, when we have Americans that are being held by a terrorist group, we would marshal resources to be able to rescue them.
On why he does not support red flag laws:
So we've always had and I've always said, if you're not mentally competent to own a firearm, that's something different than a red flag. What red flag is, is people would go in and say you may be a danger. So you could have someone lodge a complaint, different states do it different ways, oftentimes with not adequate due process. But I would say that's different from the mental health. I think most people agree that if you're not mentally competent, with rights come responsibilities and exercising the rights means you have a mental competency. So I don't think it's an issue with red flag. I think red flag has been abused, because people can just lodge a complaint. Sometimes they'll take somebody's firearms. And here's the thing. It's not even second amendment, but it is a fifth amendment due process issue. Can you take someone's property without having an adjudication? So I think it's different. I don't think it would have mattered in this case. I do think a commitment and involuntary commitment would have done the trip.
On Florida's declining crime rate:
You know, [red flag laws] were not something that I supported because I was concerned about the due process rights of individuals. Now our crime rate's at a 50-year low. I don't think it's because of that. I think it's because we've supported law enforcement, we have strong laws to hold criminals accountable and put them off the street. So I'd say if you look at why is Florida's crime declining while it's going up in places like California? I think it's probably more for our overall approach than that.
On his leadership in bringing stranded Americans home from Israel:
There were Americans that were stuck in Israel, they couldn't get out. We ended up bringing almost 700 home. They were all Americans, and most of them were Floridians, and we were--, but we didn't do only Floridians, we understood that there's others that needed. But I think the interesting thing about what I saw, because we've greeted the first flight that we brought back, 271 People 91 children, so you literally are having families come out with their dog, their kids. And then, they're very happy to see my wife and I when we greeted them, but one of the ladies told me she pointed to her six year old daughter, she said--, and they're from Florida, daughter just kept saying, 'Mommy, I don't want to hear the rockets. I don't wanna hear the rockets. I want Florida. I want Florida.' So we were able to get that done.
On his increasing momentum in the early states:
A lot of these rural counties, there'll be counties where there may be a few 1000 people, we'll get 100 people to show up at an event. You shake the hands, you answer the questions. That's not something you'll necessarily get to see in polling, that's something that comes out when people make their decisions to caucus. So we're doing it the right way. I'm going to be the only candidate does all 99 counties [in Iowa]. We've just started similar in New Hampshire. On Tuesday, I was with Governor Sununu. We did seven different events, town halls, house parties, retail stops, that's what you've got to do. You've got to show up. Donald Trump's not willing to show up. He's missing in action right now. He doesn't show up. When he does show up, he reads off the teleprompter for 50 minutes, and then he gets back on the plane and goes home. As voters are more keyed in, as we get closer to the holidays, you're not going to be able to get away with not putting in the work. So we're going to put in the work and we're going to get the job done.
On why he would make a better president than Donald Trump:
I'm more reliable on policy than Donald Trump and Republican voters, you know, I think we're starting to see that and we'll show that. I've delivered more on America First principles than anybody in the country and not just this most recent legislative session, all through my time, as governor. So we'll see that but here's the thing, I think it's true, I have shown an ability to be bold, to do big things, but then to actually win independent voters. In Florida, we won by a million and a half votes. I mean, we won independents by 18%. Donald Trump would not be able to do that and we need somebody who's going to be able to win the election, very important that you get that done.

TRANSCRIPT: 
SCOTT:  All the Republicans running for President talk tough about fighting the radical Left. But I have the battle scars.
When I fought to refund our police, liberals called me a token.
When I cut your taxes, they called me a prop.
And when I pushed back on Biden's socialist agenda, they even called me the N-word. I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control.
I'm Tim Scott, and I approve this message because I know how to fight the radical Left and win.

"Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: If You Support Terrorism, There Must Be Consequences",2023-10-25T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-if-you-support-terrorism-there-must-be-consequences,"
GREENVILLE, SC – Tim Scott joined Your World with Neil Cavuto on Fox News to condemn the rise of anti-Semitic demonstrations on college campuses. Tim also rejected President Biden's unfocused foreign aid package and advocated for standalone legislation that will send a clear message of support to Israel.
WATCH HERE
Neil Cavuto: I was thinking of these protests and what you had said a few days ago calling on the United States to revoke visas that foreign students received to be in this country. And that if they have them just revoke them, if they're part of these anti-Israeli protests. Do you still stand by that?
Sen Scott: Well, certainly. Now, let me clarify what I said, because what I said was that when we have students on campuses that are actually encouraging Jewish genocide, who are advocating for murder and supporting terrorism, those students should be expelled from the campus. And those folks who are on a visa should be deported from our country. I stand by that without any question. I wasn't being hyperbolic then. I'm not being hyperbolic now. Anytime you actually encourage for the genocide, the elimination of an entire race of people, anytime you support terrorism and encourage murder, there should be consequences. There should be consequences for those students, and there should be consequences for those universities. Back in 2016, Neil, I worked on legislation to eliminate the anti-Semitism that we see on college campuses. Things have gotten worse, not better. Jewish students do not feel safe on their own campuses. That is a problem that we need to focus on, and my legislation helps us get there. And as our president, I would simply sign the legislation that forces these universities and colleges to take back control of their college campuses.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today held a virtual press conference with Iowa media. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On why he is continuing to build on his momentum in Iowa:
We've done Iowa the right way. We've done it the way candidates who have won Iowa in the past have done it. And Iowans want to see us. They want to see you ask for their support. They want to shake your hand; they want to be able to ask you questions. They do not like candidates who think they're entitled to the vote. They want a candidate that's going to come in and earn the vote. So, we've done that. We were really the first one to lay an organization. And then of course, my commitment to doing the full Grassley. So, I think it's one thing to say you're going to shift some staff or whatnot in there, and that's fine. People can do what they want to do. But I'll be the only candidate to have done all 99 counties. And I think if you look at the support we've been able to generate, I talked to Iowans on the ground who are very familiar with history of the Iowa caucuses. And they will tell me, they're like, you know, 'Governor, you're ahead of where previous winners were in the last however many cycles out. So, just keep doing what you're doing.' So, I think we've got the right strategy. I think we've got the right message for Iowans, because I think Iowans ultimately want a conservative leader who's going to stand for their values and is going to be able to deliver results. And so just like I've done in Florida, like your Governor Kim Reynolds has done in Iowa, we need that in the next President of the United States. And I think that we're getting the support that we need. We're going to work very hard over these next 80 some odd days, of course, but I think we're going to continue to build the support that we need.
On why Republicans need to make the 2024 election about the future:
So, it's incumbent upon us as Republicans to make that case about Biden's failures but then also offer a positive vision of how you reverse the decline of this country, how we bring America back and I'm the candidate that can do that. And if that's what the election is focused on, then we're going to win not just the White House, we will win the house by bigger majority, we will recapture the US Senate majority. And we'll win up and down the ballot in the state legislative races, which are really, really important as people in Iowa have known with all the good work your legislators done. On the other hand, if the election is a referendum about all things Trump, if it's focusing on documents at Mar a Lago, it's focusing on January 6th, if it's focusing on all those things, well, then Biden's just going to be hanging out in the basement again. You're going to end up energizing a lot of Democrats who want to come out and vote against Trump. And then we ended up in a situation where the Democrats like they were able to do in '22, and in 2018, and in some of these years 2020, they're then going to be able to have the upper hand. So, I think it's a question about, how do you want the election framed? If the elections framed about the issue the American people care about, we will win. If the elections framed about all these other issues from the past, that is absolutely going to help Democrats. I don't think there's any question about it. They wouldn't be doing all these cases if they didn't think that it would help them ultimately win the election.
On the importance of showing up to debate:
I'm going to show up to debate. I think that's part of the process. I think people want to hear from you. I think it gives you an opportunity to articulate why are you the best person to be the 47th President of the United States. Donald Trump should show up to these debates. He's been totally missing in action. He swoops into Iowa, then he leaves. He was in New Hampshire for a short time then he leaves. He's always on the teleprompter now. That's kind of something that he can't get off of. When he does go off script, he ends up saying things like he told people in New Hampshire, they didn't need to worry about voting, that he already had enough votes or something, which is very odd to do. Of course, he said things in Iowa. He's been in interviews where he's done things like attack Bibi Netanyahu. So, he of course, attacked pro-lifers and taxed pro-life protections as being somehow a terrible thing. So, you see that time and time again. So, I think he owes it to the voters to show up. Remember, October of 2020, that first debate with Biden, Biden beat him in that debate. And that was really incredible that he allowed that to happen. But that's, people remember that. I think that had a real significant impact in the election. And we saw in Florida, Trump's numbers started to decline after that. So, he's got to show that he can that he can do this. I think it's a different guy in '23 than he was in 2016. I think he was energetic freewheeling back then. I think it was really about America first. Now, I think he's on the teleprompter, most of the stuff he's talking about is about himself and his issues. And that's not the inspiring message that is going to be able to win the day with the American people. But look, I think he should debate and I'm willing to allow him to bring his teleprompter to the debate, if that's what he wants to do, and we will just do it like that. But he should be on that stage in Miami. In subsequent debates, I will be there. Look, we can argue about how these debates have been run. I would run them differently. But the reality is, is I'm going to be there delivering my message. If I have an opportunity to do it to speak directly to the American people. We're going to do it. So, we look forward to being down in Miami on November 8th.

Live In-Studio with Jack Heath and Governor Chris Sununu
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Jack Heath on Good Morning New Hampshire, live in-studio alongside New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On the importance of showing up in the early states:
When voters are able to kick the tires, shake your hand, ask you a question, listen to your message, that trumps everything else out there. And what I've found when I'm out, is I will do my spiel or I'll just meet with voters, and people will come up to me and they'll say you flipped me. You flipped me from Trump to you. I'm with you now, you know, because I think people know I'm governor of Florida. They know I've done a good job, but they want to know more about me. They want to know more about where I'd take the country. And Donald Trump, I think, he's running on a lot of the same things he promised to do in 2016 and didn't deliver. He's really doing a lot of teleprompter speeches, not getting out there and talking to voters. I think he has a sense of entitlement that somehow he has this, that they just owe it to him. You got to earn this thing, and I'm going to earn it in these early states.
On why he's the most qualified to be Commander-In-Chief:
I served in Iraq, that was back in the day with al Qaeda in Iraq. We also had Iranian militias that were killing US troops. We lost probably about 1000 of our troops at the hands of Iran. I have extensive experience in the Middle East. I was on House Foreign Affairs for six years. We dealt with all these issues. I've been right about all these issues for many, many years. And then, of course, as governor, our state would be the 13th biggest economy in the world, so I've dealt with all these leaders, whether it's Japan, whether it's Israel and beyond. So I'll be able to come in, execute this, but also have a broader vision for how we keep the country safe. And I think the Hamas-Israel war is very important. I think the issues in Europe are very important. The greatest threat, though, that this country faces is the communist party of China. And China's making out like bandits right now. The eye has been taken off the ball. We have not done enough in the Indo-Pacific to be able to deter their ambitions there. And if China is able to dominate the Pacific, that will lead to them dominating the economy globally, and it will change this country for the worse. So we're actually going to be rolling out our strategy on Friday at the Heritage Foundation up in Washington, DC, but I think I'll be the only candidate that is actually clear eyed about the threat posed by China and that has a strategy that can actually protect this country.
On what his priorities will be as President:
If you look at Florida, we're number one for new business formations, number one in the economy by CNBC, fastest growing state, I've paid down almost 25% of our state's total debt, just since I've been governor. We've cut taxes, we've won budget surpluses--you'd be hard pressed to find a more vibrant economic climate right now than the state of Florida. And that's because we've led. Yes in COVID we kept things open, which was very important, but we've done so many other things. I think woke ideology is a threat to this country. I think we have to fight it. And we have to win because once institutions become corrupted by ideology, they become worthless. And we've seen that, but we've succeeded on a full spectrum of things. We have the lowest crime rate Florida's had in 50 years, even while these other cities are falling apart across the country. We've succeeded on even things like environmental restoration. I brought the Everglades back, no one thought that would happen. We got down there and did that very important for a state that relies on our natural resources. So we've succeeded across the board. If you're someone's concerned about woke, I'm definitely your guy. But if you're someone that's concerned about economic vitality, I'm your guy. Education choice, I'm your guy. Law and order, I'm your guy.
Governor Sununu on DeSantis' work ethic in New Hampshire:
The biggest message is New Hampshire is up for grabs. Right? If you listen to national media, they think it's some sort of fait accompli for Donald Trump. And we just know in New Hampshire, on the ground that's not the way it works. A lot of us won't even decide who we're voting for until the last couple of weeks. Governor DeSantis has an incredible record of good retail campaigning in Florida. He's bringing that to the national stage. He's done this incredible job in Iowa. He's spending time in New Hampshire. And look, I'm just, I try to bring the best out of everybody in terms of that retail campaigning and politics, introduce him around. I've had a lot of folks come up to me in the past few months, I want to meet Governor DeSantis, I want to meet governor DeSantis -- well, here he is. And so we're going to go to a bunch of different events. We were at the Red Arrow diner, the beach plum, some house parties, visit some businesses, and that's what it's all about -- one on one, you know, shaking the hands, looking them in the eye, and letting anybody ask any questions. Not getting stuck behind rope lines. We saw a few rope lines with the former President Trump yesterday. He had about maybe, what, 12 supporters or something sitting in the hallway. It was pretty pathetic. Same old crowd you've ever seen. And that's kind of the message. Trump is -- look, thank you for your service, thank you for your four years, some good policy ideas you didn't execute. You know, there's an opportunity for the Republican Party to really move forward nationally. And Governor DeSantis is trying to take them there.

Tallahassee, FL - After a fun day in Boston yesterday visiting Fenway Park and filing for the Massachusetts ballot, Ron DeSantis continued his New England visit with an action-packed day in New Hampshire. Ron DeSantis, along with Casey DeSantis and 5-year-old Mason, went all around the Granite State with New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu.
The group kicked off the day with coffee at the Red Arrow Diner in Londonderry.
At Red Arrow Diner, DeSantis said in a press gaggle,
""What Donald Trump does now, he is wedded to the teleprompter. He can't get off that teleprompter. Any time he does, he says things like 'Don't vote.' He's telling people not to vote like we have all the votes we need. Really? Like wait a minute. You lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016. You don't have all the votes you need...this is a different Donald Trump than 2015 and 2016.""
Then, DeSantis and Sununu joined radio host Jack Heath live in-studio on his show Good Morning New Hampshire. Listen to the full interview HERE.
For lunch, they stopped at Popovers in Epping, and then enjoyed a sweet treat afterwards at Beach Plum.
The governor and Mason even stopped to throw a football around!
During the day, DeSantis did a pull aside interview with Fox Digital's Paul Steinhauser, in which he highlighted the policy differences he has with Nikki Haley on China.
""It's very jarring to see her, in her own words, talk about how she wants to roll out the red carpet for the CCP. I did the opposite in Florida. We banned the CCP from purchasing land in Florida. We didn't give them any free land. So that's an honest difference of policy, who do you trust to lead? Somebody that's actually stood up to China, or somebody that rolled out the red carpet for China?""
In the afternoon, DeSantis held a meet and greet with employees of Sig Sauer in Newington.
DeSantis wrapped up the day as a special guest at a townhall in Rye hosted by Never Back Down, alongside Governor Sununu. In his opening remarks, Sununu praised DeSantis' leadership, saying,
""Having a governor that understands how to mobilize infrastructure, how to react in a crisis, how not to wilt, how not to just play political games and political stunts and political headlines, just getting stuff done because at the end of the day, it's all about the results. That's an amazing opportunity we have. I'm going to remind everyone- you want to win in November? Then let's get behind a winner for November.""
During the day, DeSantis and Sununu joined Adam Sexton for an interview that aired on WMUR's evening news. When asked by Sexton how he was connecting with New Hampshire voters, DeSantis replied,
""That's why you show up. That's why you deliver the message and talk about the successes we've had in Florida and talk about how you parlay that into turning this country around because I think Republican, independent, even a lot of Democrats now, they know the country's on the Skids.""

""This isn't just some random skirmish. I mean, they're fighting for their existence against people that would like to see a second holocaust."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Newsmax's The Balance with Eric Bolling. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On his trip to Fenway Park:
My wife and I are up here with our five year old son Mason, who's a big baseball guy, and we took him to the field we did a tour, he got to go up on the green monster, he got to run the bases, he got to go out and inside the monster where they do the scoreboard and I tried to explain to him how it's one of the most famous parks in baseball, he got excited, and I think he had a really good time. But Eric, anyone that appreciates baseball, and I know you do, there's certain venues that are really really special and Fenway Park is one of those. I remember the first time I went many years ago, and it's definitely something you'll always remember. Big deal, big deal, no question. That's special.
On protecting US interests while supporting Israel:
I think Israel, they're capable of handling Hezbollah as well. I mean, Hezbollah, you know, they do pack some firepower. But I think this is something that Israel, they got a massive military, they've called up all their reserves, I think they would be able to handle it. So we would support them in that if it needed to be. But I don't anticipate it would be something that would draw the United States. And I think that we have to be careful about getting a meshed in a war in the Middle East, partially because China is really going to take advantage of this situation. And you just find yourself $33 trillion in debt as it is, a very weakened defense industrial base, of course, a president that's not leading on anything. And that is an invitation for Chinese aggression. So I do agree, we got to be careful about how that plays out. But I do think Israel is capable of defending itself the way it needs to in this situation without needlessly provoking some type of white wider war.
On why funding for Israel and Ukraine should be separate:
Well, they are different, they should be treated separately, it should not be bundled together. And you raised a good point, which I think those guys in DC don't talk about enough. We have scarce resources, there's only so much that we can do with our defense industrial base being the way it is. We've already taking taken ammo from stockpiles in Israel and diverted to Ukraine in the past. Now they're looking to see where they go further stockpiles. And it's not just those two theaters, of course, because the largest threat that we face as Americans is from the Chinese Communist Party. And clearly Biden has not done what is necessary to fortify our defenses in the Indo Pacific. He's not doing what's necessary to deter China from seeking its ambitions to dominate the Pacific. So you have all these things that need to be considered. I think for Israel, it's important to point out that in perspective, the federal government has given $120, $100 and $30 billion to Ukraine in the last two years. The United States has given Israel for its 75-year history, about $158 billion. So what they've done with Ukraine is so much over and above anything that's ever approached with Israel. I don't think in Israel, I think we just need to be supportive of them publicly. I think privately, we want to say do what you got to do, yes, whatever ongoing military support we have with Iron Dome and all that we should continue that, but I don't think it's going to be a situation where America is going to need to take a lead in that. I don't think it's our war. I do think it's Israel's war.

Becomes 5th Candidate to Meet Requirement
Doug Burgum for America announced today that it has exceeded the donor requirements set forth by the Republican National Committee to qualify for the third debate.
Burgum has received contributions from over 70,000 individual donors, including more than 200 from 20 different states. Burgum is just the 5th candidate to meet the RNC's requirements.
""Doug Burgum was one of the last candidates to get in the race and is now among the first to reach the donor threshold,"" said campaign spokesman Lance Trover. ""While he plans to continue defying the odds and be on the debate stage, our campaign knows that ultimately it is the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire who will begin the process of picking the next President, not pundits and national polls.""
Burgum's announcement comes on the heels of the Best of America PAC announcing last week major new investments and a hyper-targeting program aimed at Republicans in Iowa, New Hampshire and throughout the nation.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Goes All In On Iowa,2023-10-23T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-goes-all-iowa,"
MARSHALLTOWN, IA – The Tim Scott campaign announced today moves to go all-in on Iowa, seeing an opportunity and wide-open evangelical lane to win the Iowa Republican caucus.
This week, the campaign will double its staff on the ground in Iowa and open a new West Des Moines, Iowa headquarters. Additionally, following the next debate, the Senator will travel across the Hawkeye State every week in the lead-up to the caucus.
The campaign will shift resources from New Hampshire to Iowa, expand audiences to complement the current voter-contact programs, and boost social-conservative paid media efforts in the Hawkeye State. The campaign currently has $1.6 million of TV reserved in Iowa going forward. More staff and resources will head to Iowa in the weeks ahead.
""Tim Scott is all in on Iowa,"" said Tim Scott for America Campaign Manager Jennifer DeCasper. ""As the candidate with the highest net favorables, Tim Scott is best positioned to compete on caucus day. No candidate other than Tim Scott has the resources, the foundation of support, and the message to be successful in the Hawkeye State. We're all in on Iowa as an important first step on the road to winning the nomination.""
Tim Scott entered the third quarter with more primary cash available to spend than any other Republican presidential candidate, besides the former president. The Senator's net favorables (+58%) in Iowa are the highest in the field today, and that number is even higher with Iowa Evangelical voters (+69%) who make up a majority of the caucus-going electorate. Tim Scott is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the foundation the campaign has built in Iowa, particularly with persuadable Evangelical voters.
Tim Scott is concluding a five-day swing through Iowa tomorrow, and will be back in the Hawkeye State next week for a series of events.

CHICAGO, IL – Today, Senator Tim Scott delivered a speech on race and power at New Beginnings Church in Chicago. Tim addressed the radical Left's weaponization of race and class to divide Americans, and how that has led to the decline of communities like Woodlawn.
During the speech, Tim also discussed the failed legacy of ""Great Society"" policies, and the need to restore a message of personal responsibility and empowerment.

HIGHLIGHTS:
""It's an honor to be in a place where you know that a visionary gives you an opportunity to experience whatever the Lord has planned for you. That's what the Lord offers each of us. He offers each of us a new beginning. Take off the old self and put on the new. Put on the new with a walk with Jesus. It's also what Chicago and big cities across our nation desperately need. We need new beginnings.""
""My grandfather was born in 1921 in the deep South... This man had every single excuse to give up hope. But he led. He held on to faith. He believed that faith in God, faith in himself, and faith in what America could one day be, could be the key to changing things around.""
""I ran for Congress in Charleston, South Carolina... And I ran against Senator Thurmond's son... in the place where the Civil War started. And they said, you don't have a single chance. Well, I hear that these days. Sometimes they say, ""you have no chance, so just sit down."" But I won that race... So you can't tell me things haven't changed. You can't tell me America has not made progress. You can't tell me that lie because I've lived it.""
""The progressive philosophy has a monopoly right now. But it's not working. The streets aren't safe. The schools aren't good.  And for too many kids who look like us, the future is not as bright as it could be. It's not as bright as it should be, and it's not as bright as it needs to be... I'm running for president because I believe that a new vision with a new mission can make a difference.""
""The Great Society, also known as the modern day welfare system and the creeping of socialism into the community, devastated our community... Our country has made, however, tremendous strides since slavery on the issue of race. But lawlessness and fatherlessness and joblessness have gotten worse in the last sixty years and not better. You see in the 1960s when I was born, 70% of our kids lived with two parents in the household. Today, 70% of our kids do not.""
""The far Left has spent decades getting soft on crime, defending failing schools, undermining traditional values, and weakening capitalism. And you can measure that devastation... you measure it in crime, in unemployment, but most importantly in despair. Proverbs 13:12 says that hope deferred makes the heart sick.""
""Progressives would rather lower the bar for people of color than raise the bar on their own leadership. They say they want low income Americans and people of color to rise, but their actions take us in the opposite direction. The actions say they want us to sit down, shut up, and don't forget to vote as long as we're voting blue. Instead of solutions, we are offered distractions and division.""
""I'm a conservative because I believe that the Great Opportunity Party must stand up and have a conversation with people who look like us. We ought to have an alternative. I believe we have the economic solutions that create jobs, opportunity, and investments. I believe that education policy should give every family a choice, every parent a voice, and every child a chance. I believe that the biblical values that reinforce the importance of life and human dignity is how we stop the staggering levels of abortion of kids throughout this country, especially African American babies.""
""Are we tough enough to get better instead of bitter? Are we tough enough to show what it means to be a victor and not a victim? Whatever our color, whatever our story, every one of us has a duty to our own choices. Praise the living God, the master of our faith. We are the captain of our ship. You can't have freedom without personal responsibility.""
""It's a simple formula. Finish high school, get a job, then get married, then have kids, and you reduce the likelihood of living in poverty by 97%... That's where the real power is. If you listen to God's word, use a little common sense and do what your grandmama and my grandmama have taught us to do, you reduce the chance of living in poverty by 97%.""

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott to Biden: We Need A Single Focus On Israel,2023-10-22T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-biden-we-need-single-focus-israel,"
DES MOINES, IA – Tim Scott joined Jon Karl on ABC's This Week to denounce President Biden's lack of focus on unified support for Israel. Tim stood firm that the terror unfolding against Israel should not be leveraged for additional funding for Ukraine.
WATCH HERE
Jon Karl: The president is asking for an emergency funding request which includes $14 billion for Israel, $60 billion for Ukraine, also money for the border, money to protect Taiwan. Are you in favor of that package?
Tim Scott: I am not as the package is currently constructed. I believe that leveraging the challenges in the war with Israel to get more assistance for Ukraine at that level of $60 billion is too much. And we need to have a single focus on bringing Congress together behind the support for Israel. That package would pass overnight. Having a package that's splintered makes it more difficult to get through the houses of Congress and get the aid to where we need it and send a unified support to Israel....
Tim Scott: I'm a happy warrior without any question, but we are now in the midst of a conflict. And so the warrior in me requires responsibility to start at the top. Think about the fact that the weakness of Joe Biden attracts conflict around this world, and frankly, the negotiations with Iran, specifically, $6 billion for hostages, only creates a bigger market for Americans abroad.

""Colleges should be for the education of our kids, not for the indoctrination of our kids."" – Tim Scott
CORALVILLE, IA – Tim Scott joined FOX and Friends Saturday this morning to blast the rise of anti-Semitism on college campuses and the Squad's silence during Hamas' murder of Israelis and Americans. Tim also highlighted his new legislation to pull funding from colleges and universities that support hateful behavior.
WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: And to have the Squad tell people to have a ceasefire, to have the Squad keep up a tweet that says that Israel was responsible for 500 deaths at a hospital, even though it has proven to be a lie, I find their actions despicable. I find their conduct disgusting. I find their presence as a part of the House of Representatives antithetical to what we stand for as a nation, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans, we stand against hate.
And that's exactly why I am leading on legislation that eliminates funding for universities that say it is acceptable for their students to call for genocide. It is acceptable for their students to support terrorism. It's acceptable for their students to support murder. You have free speech, but you can't be an idiot. And so I think pulling the funding, the Pell grants from colleges and universities that support that kind of malignant behavior is in the best interest of every single good American who understands that funding colleges should be for the education of our kids, not for the indoctrination of our kids....
Tim Scott: One of the things I find challenging is if you believe in a hundred genders, you have freedom of speech. If you wanna speak about your faith and your love for Jesus on a college campus, somehow that's called hate and you lose your First Amendment rights. We as a nation, there are good people on both sides of the aisle. Frankly, here's what I believe, I believe that Joe Biden can't even be honest about any positions because he's beholden to the Squad. Political power is more important than doing the right thing. For the radical Left, control is more important than doing the right thing. And frankly, they'll use race, class, and even genocide from the Squad in order to hold on to political power and it is disgusting.

Scott Campaign Press Release - NY Post: Expel Hamas' propagandists in Congress — and don't give the terrorists taxpayer cash,2023-10-20T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-ny-post-expel-hamas-propagandists-congress-and-dont-give-the,"
The NY Post 
October 20, 2023
The world came face-to-face with evil incarnate this month.
Terrorist killers carried out the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the end of the Holocaust.
Devastation after devastation. And then on top of that, we see the emergence of another deadly counter.
Rather than waiting for the facts, members of Congress and mainstream-media outlets carried the narrative of an evil, lying terrorist organization: Hamas.
The misinformation war could be just as if not more deadly than the ongoing conflict that has ravaged the Israeli people.
Immediately following the surprise attacks within Israel's borders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a signal that the Israel Defense Forces are going into Gaza, giving civilians a chance to find themselves out of harm's way.
This act of humanity was not afforded to the innocent Israeli civilians Hamas murdered.
In another front, Hamas launched a misinformation campaign built on a lie that an Israeli missile struck a hospital, killing hundreds.
That misinformation was carried in news outlets in America and across the globe.
Hamas' lie, spread by the media, caused a summit in Jordan to be canceled.
It sparked protests at American embassies around the world.
Hezbollah mobilized.
We saw a very clear attempt to weaken Israel and its standing in the world. All built on a lie.
The truth is Hamas-aligned Islamic Jihad fired the rocket, and dozens of innocent civilians in Gaza lost their lives.
Then the Democratic members of the so-called ""Squad,"" such as Rep. Rashida Tlaib, parroted Hamas propaganda in social-media posts.
Rather than delete her post, Tlaib kept it up.
Worse, Tlaib continued to echo the lie during a pro-Hamas rally outside the Capitol.
The Squad's poisonous anti-Israel obsession did not begin these past few days.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal practically copy-pasted Hamas propaganda this year and called Israel ""a racist state.""
In 2019, Rep. Ilhan Omar barely escaped House censure after invoking anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money.
Their colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said that supporting Israel means ""taking the side of occupation,"" language that could have been cribbed from a terrorist press release.
And on and on.
I know we shouldn't expect more from the Squad, but we cannot have members of Congress being a part of the propaganda machine for Hamas.
It's undeniably crazy.
We deserve better.
That's why I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop sending money into Gaza until Israel wipes Hamas off the face of the Earth.
We cannot send money to Iran or Hamas.
Period.
When you give $6 billion to a country that funds terrorism, you cannot be surprised when they go and do what they always have done.
Iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism and Hamas' chief financial backer, yet the Biden administration has no interest in holding it accountable.
This is not complicated.
It is black and white.
These murderers have killed and kidnapped hundreds of Israelis and slaughtered American citizens.
There should not be a single US taxpayer dollar that risks ending up in the hands of Hamas, and any member of Congress who gives the group aid, comfort or justification is in violation of their constitutional oath and must be removed.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott On CNN: Iran Must Pay A Very High Price,2023-10-20T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-cnn-iran-must-pay-very-high-price,"
NEW YORK, NY – Last night, Tim Scott joined CNN's Abby Phillip on NewsNight to discuss President Biden's address to the nation. Tim urged Biden to prioritize providing Israel with the resources they need to wipe Hamas off the face of the Earth.
WATCH HERE
Abby Phillip: So President Biden, as you know today, he asked for a hundred billion dollars for Israel, for Ukraine, for the border, and for Taiwan. Would you support that legislation of a hundred billion dollars?
Tim Scott: Thank you for the question. I certainly say I was frustrated by this speech. Terrorists bombed our ally Israel, and we heard more about Ukraine than we did our ally Israel. And the package itself has more money for Ukraine than it does for Israel. I think we would be better off having a single focus on Israel, giving them the resources they need to win this war, and then move on to other topics....
Tim Scott: We have a hundred billion dollars in Ukraine. We have provided so far nothing to Israel other than our annual appropriations. If we wanna focus on being successful in Israel, we need to focus on two things. Number one, making sure Israel has all the resources that they need. And number two, making sure that Iran pays a very high price for the challenges that they've brought into the Middle East including freezing the $6 billion that President Biden gave to Iran that helps support and fund terrorism. He said to himself, for the first time so far since the conflict started, he said, Iran funds terrorism — Hamas. Hamas says, thank you for the money freezing. Those assets should have happened before. Actually, he should never have given the assets.
Let me speak to your audience. The bottom line is simply this, that your president gave $6 billion to pay for hostages. He gave it to the number one state sponsor of terrorism. As a result of that $6 billion, the price on every American head went high. And there's a price to be paid for that.
I want to make sure that we get this point right, because I'm not misleading your audience. So let's make sure they understand. $6 billion is a really high price that causes more terrorism.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today delivered remarks to the NC/SC Federation of Republican Women. The highlights are below.
Watch the full remarks HERE.
On Biden's proposal to aid Ukraine and Israel in one package:
They should not do one package. These are separate issues. They should debate them separately, and let the American people weigh in accordingly. You know, I'll say this. So we've had a long standing relationship with Israel. I've always supported that relationship that has involved military support, and whatnot. I mean, usually a few billion dollars a year, we've done about 150 billion to Israel, since its inception over 75 years. I think it's 158 billion. They're not really asking us for that much now. Now maybe he'll say 'Behind the scenes, Bibi has asked for some of this.' But they have a good military. I got asked in the town hall today, you know, would you would you put our troops in Israel? Of course not. They can defend themselves. We support their right to defend themselves, but it's their war. It's not it's not our war. And so I don't know what they've asked for. So I want to see what they've asked for. I think my sense about what Biden's doing is, he knows that Ukraine money is not popular with the public because they've spent a lot. They haven't put a clear objective to it. It's kind of a stalemate. A lot of that money is going to like social services and salaries for bureaucrats and things that American taxpayers do not want to fund. So he understands that there's a political problem. And I think he thinks if he can attach Israel and just throw a bunch of money there, then because it's Israel, everyone's going to have to say yes, but I think that Congress is not going to just eat that. I think they're going to separate them. And I think that they're going to do so. I'm supportive of Israel. But even with Israel, you have to identify, you know, how much money and justify that. I mean, I think the way these people have spent your money and put us in debt, the burden should be on them to make sure that all this is something, you know, that's on the up and up. But I think that by and large, the support for Israel is going to be important, but I don't think it's going to be 10s of billions. I really don't. I don't think they're asking for 10s of billions and I think that is what we would save money by just saying do the job and take out Hamas and don't try to undercut them if we just did that. I think they'd be able to take care of this in relatively short order.
On why this is a two-man race:
I've been very weary of saying what anyone else should do, but I think, clearly, if you're not even able to meet that criteria to even get into a debate, then that's a problem. I mean, what's your path to victory at that point to be able to do? So, here's just the honest to God truth, you know, there's two people with a pathway to victory. You know, you have the former president, who obviously, he's the best known and he's got a lot of legacy support and then you got me. I'm the only guy that can appeal to enough voters to be able to actually get it done ultimately. And you know, you were showing that as we work through Iowa, you're going to start to see that I think more and more as we get to the end of the year, and people start to dig in. But that's just, that's just the reality. And I think if that's your choice, and it comes down to that, and it may come down to that by South Carolina, who knows, right? My argument would be a couple things. One, we need a president that can serve two terms. A lame duck president is not going to be able to get the job done. I don't care who you are. You know, George Washington, I don't know could get this done as a lame duck president. So you need to have that. You also need a nominee who can win. And I think the way you win is to focus the election on Biden's failures, and our positive vision for the future. If the elections about all these other issues, then it's going to give the Democrats a huge advantage, it's going to give the media and ability to drive that in. And they will do that, they'll change their tune on all this, you watch if the former President's the nominee. So we want it to be an election on Biden and us as the positive, just like it was for Reagan versus Carter, in 1980. So I think that that's really important. Also, you need a president that's going to be able to attract the personnel necessary to fill the administration. I don't think Donald Trump could get the people to serve in the administration. I mean, think about all the problems, so many of them have already had, how he's treated a lot of people, you know, as a leader, when things go wrong, you've got to take responsibility, you know, it's easy to try to throw someone else under the bus, but they need to know that, you know, you'll have their back when the going gets tough. And so you know, I've shown that in Florida. So, the personnel because you can make the best decisions in the world, you can have the best vision and the best policy, if you don't have a cadre of people there that are helping to implement that, particularly in the face of a hostile bureaucracy, then it's not going to amount to very much. So that's another thing. And then I think you want somebody who has the track record of delivering on the promises. And, you know, I went to Trump's rallies in 16. I was excited about build the wall, have Mexico pay for it, didn't deliver, drain the swamp, didn't deliver, special counsel for Hillary. He said that and then two weeks after the election, he said, never mind Hillary, he said he likes her now he says she's beautiful Hillary, that's how he refers to her. He's promising the same stuff this time except the special counsels for Biden. So it's like, okay, well, wait a minute, you're running on the same stuff. You didn't do it the first time, you'd be a lame duck, if you could even get elected and all that. Why not have, give somebody a chance, who is going to spit nails from day one is going to be energetic is going to be forceful, discipline, focus, and deliver for you. It's not about me, it's about you.
On his plan to reverse Bidenomics:
Any money that has not actually gone out the door, I'm calling back. They still have COVID money out there. So whatever's there, we're calling back. We're going to set a new standard with Congress. I'll veto if you if you go over certain levels of spending, because their spending habit has caused this. We're going to take all the Biden rules and regulations, rip them out, throw them in the trash can, because we need to grow the economy again. I mean, part of the way you reduce inflation, you increase productivity and investment, we need to do that. We are going to open up energy production, federal lands, Alaska, all this stuff will be the dominant energy producer in this country. It'll lower your gas prices, lower energy costs, effects, everything that you buy, so it's going to be good for the economy prices generally. It'll be good for jobs, and it'll be good for our our national security.
On securing the border and combatting cartels:
We are going to build the border wall, and I'm actually going to make Mexico pay for it like the promise from 2016. Here's how you do it. Yeah, Mexico is just not going to cough up money. What you do is, we're going to impose fees on the remittances that people send back to Mexico and Central America. You'll raise billions of dollars, and we'll build the wall, and we'll actually get the job done. We're also going to hold the Mexican drug cartels accountable for killing tens of thousands of our fellow Americans. I've met Angel moms who have lost kids to fentanyl overdose. And the thing is, you know, drugs can be a tough thing, addiction is tough, but a lot of these kids are high school, college, they're not even addicted to drugs; they may have taken one thing and it happens to be laced with fentanyl. And then they die. And we had a situation in Florida, we had an 18-month-old baby at an Airbnb rental crawling on the carpet, and there was fentanyl residue on the carpet, and the baby died. So this is causing massive amount of damage to our country and to our communities. And I'm going to treat the Mexican drug cartels like foreign terrorist organizations, and we are going to use deadly military force to defeat the Mexican drug cartels.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Releases Plan to Support America's Veterans,2023-10-19T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-releases-plan-support-americas-veterans,"
Tallahasee, FL - Prior to his first ""Veterans for DeSantis"" event today in Anderson, South Carolina, Ron DeSantis released a plan to support America's veterans. DeSantis will modernize the VA and transcend its bureaucracy, combat the mental health and economic issues facing veterans, expand access and benefits to veterans, reverse Biden's recruitment crisis, and restore accountability to the VA.
""DC elites have weakened our nation's military -- wokeism runs rampant, morale has taken a nosedive, and recruitment has sunk to an all-time low,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""The ruling class has also left behind the patriots who put their life on the line for America, and that ends under my administration. We will restore our military and take care of our heroes. I know what it means to wear the cloth our country, and I will not let America's veterans down.""
This is the fifth major policy announcement DeSantis has made since launching his campaign. It follows the plan to stop the invasion and secure the border DeSantis unveiled in Texas in June, his plan for a mission first military he released in South Carolina in July, his plan to declare America's economic independence he announced in New Hampshire in August and his plan to revive American energy dominance he detailed in Texas in September.
The only veteran in the race, DeSantis would be the first president to serve in a war to be elected since 1988.
Ron DeSantis' Plan to Support America's Veterans
Transcend Bureaucracy and Modernize VA Systems and Infrastructure

Connect veterans with all available support -- veteran care, benefits, and resources should never be limited to a single federal agency
Ensure veterans have access to a simple, straight-forward portal connecting all available support from federal, state, local, private, business, religious, and charitable organizations, similar to Florida's Care Portal and Hope Navigators
Audit IT deficiencies, streamline infrastructure, and upgrade patient record system
Eliminate redundant Congressional & VA boards, review management layers, independently audit programs, and investigate and prosecute fraud
Expand grant programs and partnerships with community-level veteran organizations

Combat Veteran Suicide, Substance Abuse, and Homelessness

Address root causes, facilitate timely access to care, and increase support for PTS, depression, and substance abuse
Expand benefits, educational training, and work opportunities to assist veterans in the transition to civilian life
Expand the VA FOX Grant program and ensure funding goes to state and local entities
Make the Executive Director of VA Suicide Prevention a politically appointed position that reports directly to the Secretary
Create a uniform veteran status verification tool for local counties and municipalities, ensuring better data on veteran suicide

Focus on Care, End Delays and Denials, and Expand Access and Benefits

Rescind left-wing policies not aligned with the VA's core mission, such as CRT, DEI, paid leave/travel for abortion, sex reassignment surgeries, and hormone therapies
Set clear benchmarks for quality and timeliness of services delivered, including reductions in delays & denials, inaccurate wait estimates, and canceled appointments
Codify standards on care choices under the MISSION Act, streamline the referral process, protect veteran-doctor relationships, and empower veterans to seek the best health care available, including outside the VA system
Expand access to private disability exams and improve claims automation
Enhance rural care options and recruit additional medical officers and nurses to underserved regions

Prioritize Lethality, Readiness, and Cohesion to Reverse Biden's Recruitment Crisis

Restore pride and trust in our military and expand recruitment programming and partnerships in high schools, JROTC, and school civics programs
Ban woke indoctrination at all military academies and the promotion of woke ideology by anyone acting on behalf of the U.S. military
Ban race and gender quotas in military recruiting and promotions and mandate personnel decisions, including accession, assignment, selection, and promotion based on merit
Reinstate servicemembers with backpay who refused to get mandated COVID vaccines
Permit education savings accounts for military families to ensure no one has to choose between a career in the military and a quality education for his or her child
Retool the Foreign Service by active recruitment of honorably discharged veterans

Restore Accountability at the VA

Strengthen accountability measures and expedite termination process for bad employees
End union deals that don't put our veterans first and negatively affect service quality
Enhance protections for whistleblowers

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Responds: Biden Failed To Send Iran A Clear Forceful Message,2023-10-19T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-responds-biden-failed-send-iran-clear-forceful,"
""One of the things that we need from this President is clarity. [Biden] doesn't seem to be able to speak clearly."" – Tim Scott 
NEW YORK, NY – Tonight, Tim Scott joined Fox News on Hannity to react to President Biden's address to the nation on Israel and Ukraine. Tim slammed Biden's weakness on the world stage and called out mainstream media that was part of the Hamas propaganda machine.
WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: One of the things that we need from this President is clarity. He doesn't seem to be able to speak clearly. He gave a speech tonight, remember our ally Israel was bombed by a terrorist organization and tonight's speech focused more on Ukraine than it did on Israel. That's unbelievable. Number one. Number two, if we're going to send the kind of message that has strength in it, we need the Gerald R. Ford and the Sixth Fleet prepared in the Mediterranean as a deterrent telling Iran consequences are coming if you bomb Israel. ...
Tim Scott: They don't want to just eliminate Israel. Hamas' objective is to eliminate every single Jewish person on Earth and then attack Western democracy. There's a little Satan called Israel, and there's a big Satan called America. Any president of the United States who doesn't understand that cannot walk and chew gum at the same time. And that is, in my opinion, an abdication of responsibility, not to send a forceful clear message with consequences to Iran, who funnels money to Hamas and Hezbollah, and to push back in the West Bank against the Palestinian authority who canceled a meeting because they were able to disrespect the President of the United States because of his weakness.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: SC State Senator Josh Kimbrell: DeSantis: Leading the Republican field in supporting Israel,2023-10-19T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-sc-state-senator-josh-kimbrell-desantis-leading-the,"
Amidst a leadership vacuum, Ron DeSantis stepped up to show DC what leadership in action looks like.
DeSantis: Leading the Republican field in supporting IsraelSC Sen. Josh Kimbrell -- OpinionOctober 19, 2023Washington Times
Our greatest ally in the Middle East is under attack, and our ruling class has been in complete disarray. The House of Representatives hasn't had a Speaker for weeks. Pro-Hamas protests have popped up across the country. The Biden administration slow-walked its feet, rescuing Americans in danger. Now they're mulling sending aid to Gaza -- essentially flushing Hamas with cash -- while the Iranian-backed terrorists still hold American hostages.
The Establishment wasted no time in crafting an agenda to put Americans last.
But amidst a leadership vacuum, Ron DeSantis stepped up to show DC what leadership in action looks like. He signed an executive order to mobilize airlifts for the thousands of Americans trapped in Israel. While some like Adam Kinzinger mocked the action, just days later, Mr. DeSantis and his family greeted 270 Americans, 91 children and 4 dogs on a tarmac in Tampa, Florida. Ron DeSantis refused to sit on the sidelines and pulled ""DeSantis Airlines"" together to rescue the people he serves.
While the Biden administration floats aid proposals to Hamas, Mr. DeSantis was the first to demand that ""Biden should work with Israel to free all American and Israeli hostages, not shower Hamas with money."" Mr. DeSantis also looked forward, knowing the left would use this crisis as an excuse to import refugees with toxic, anti-American ideology, and led the Republican field standing in firm opposition to accepting refugees with ties to terrorists.
The U.S. absolutely should not absorb Gaza refugees. Neighboring Arab nations should open their borders to them instead, as Hamas rules Gaza, and there is no effective way to vet individuals who may be relocated from an area governed by a terrorist regime. Gaza teaches their children to hate America and prepares their kids to commit terrorist attacks against Jews and Christians.
Mr. DeSantis planted a flag in the ground to put Americans first. While every Republican presidential candidate should be willing to say exactly what Ron DeSantis said, Nikki Haley couldn't agree initially.
What did Nikki Haley have to say about Mr. DeSantis' protecting Americans through common-sense refugee policy? Ms. Haley sided with the mainstream media and wouldn't rule out taking Gaza refugees into the American heartland. She said that many of those in Palestine ""want to be free from this terrorist rule,"" ""America has always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists,"" and ""that's what we have to do.""
Nikki Haley thinks she knows better than the American people because of her two years at the decidedly anti-Israel United Nations, but allowing Gaza refugees to be resettled in the United States is a clear national security threat. She had the chance to agree with Mr. DeSantis on a very straightforward America First policy and didn't take it.
Mr. DeSantis ripped her tepid response, leaving the door open for importing anti-American refugees saying that, ""She's trying to be politically correct. She's trying to please the media and people on the left, I don't care about that. I'm gonna speak the truth and let the chips fall where they may.""
Only after swift, severe backlash is Ms. Haley trying to walk back her position. The thing is: You don't get do-overs as president. When Ron DeSantis says something, he means it. He doesn't mince words. He leads and delivers. This is the kind of leadership we need in the next White House.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on the Brian Kilmeade Show,2023-10-18T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-the-brian-kilmeade-show,"
""They have a right to protect their people and they have a right to see this through.""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Ron DeSantis joined Fox News Radio's Brian Kilmeade today on The Brian Kilmeade Show. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On the media's fake narrative about the Gaza hospital bombing:
You had media organizations jumping the gun, pursuing a narrative about this hospital, basically taking the word of Hamas for it that this was somehow an IDF strike on a hospital, when in fact, it was a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad that misfired and hit the hospital. And so, the media ran with that, that stoked a lot of rage throughout the region, and it was false. So I think that shows Israel what they're up against because they obviously have to conduct operations to be able to eliminate Hamas and eliminate that threat once and for all. But they are going to be fighting in an environment where so much of the media is going to be arrayed against them, so much of the Intelligentsia, internationally, United Nations, all these different things. And it's just important that America stand with them, have moral clarity, and say you know what, they were the victims of this attack, they have a right to protect their people, and they have a right to see this through.
On taking on Donald Trump on the debate stage:
One, I think just the fact that he's been missing in action on so much of this stuff. He doesn't think he needs to go out and debate, and I don't think that that's what I'm seeing on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire. I think those voters think you have to earn their vote. So I'm showing up, not only at debates, but I've done 80 of the 99 counties in Iowa. I'm going to do all 99. I'll be the only candidate to do that. And we're starting a big New Hampshire push with the town halls and everything. So that's really what you have to do. You know, on this issue, what we've seen here, you know, I've been leading on it. We lead on the refugees. Now every candidate's followed suit. We've led on planning the flag saying don't send aid to the Gaza Strip, all that's going to do is Hamas is going to commandeer that and they're going to use that. You seek the release of hostages and the unconditional defeat of Hamas. And that should be our focus, not sending money that they're going to be able to use. So we're really leading on these issues. I think the debate will show that we've been able to lead on these issues. And look, people are going to have to make a judgement. Now that we're getting closer, you are seeing more voters pay closer attention. And I think the question is, you know, we've got a win this election in 2024. I've got a great record of political success. But more importantly than that, we've got to deliver on all these things, Brian, we talk about it -- you know, this border, remember, that was Donald Trump's number one promise. And had he built the wall and have Mexico pay for it, Biden would not have been able to get away with all the nonsense he's done. So we've got to deliver. And I have a record of delivering on 100% of my promises as governor in a way that no governor has been able to do. And we'll do the same thing as President. That's what people want to see.
On why the US should not accept Gazan refugees:
The point that Brennan was trying to make, and then Nikki Haley tried to make it this weekend but she's backtracked, is that well, you know, you have some people with Hamas, but then you have others that are more interested in freedom and all this stuff. And that's actually not the question. Obviously, you wouldn't import a terrorist. But if you're importing people from Gaza that have been taught to hate Jews, that don't believe Israel has a right to exist, that that think that, you know, Israel needs to be destroyed, we're importing pathologies from that part of the world to our country. And that's not in the interest of the American people. The American people will not benefit from that. So, I've said absolutely not. Now, I agree with you. I think most Americans, Republicans, independents, and now even a lot of Democrats understand when you see some of these protests and these demonstrations in our own country -- when the blood wasn't even dry from these Israelis who were massacred over there, you had people taking to the streets praising Hamas, in defense of Hamas. How do we get to that point where that happened? So, I think people are like, we've really got to take seriously who's coming into our country. Yes, illegally across the border. But who are we intentionally importing with some of the things that have happened over the last many years? And so, that's the right decision. Now the elites, the elites don't care about the American people. They have their own agenda. So elite media and other elites in government, they would have a different view than me. But my view, I think, is what has support from broad cross sections of the American public.
On the Pro-Hamas protests at our nation's collegiate institutions:
It's unbelievable. You know, I joke with people. I say, on the campaign trail, I'm like, look, I'm one of the few people that have gone to Harvard and Yale and came out more conservative than when I went in. And that's not easy to do because of the leftist viewpoints. But I will say, as left as it was when I was going through that -- and I rejected it, and it kind of made me more conservative -- it's gotten a lot worse in the last couple of decades. I mean, it's gotten to the point, you know, I don't think after 9/11 you had protests on Ivy League campuses praising what had happened, praising the terrorists, or doing anything like that. Now, you have protesters praising brutal terrorists on those campuses, signing letters. And I think it's totally appropriate -- and indeed, these businesses should be doing that -- if they're students that are signing that in defense of Hamas, they get offers of employment rescinded, they get fired from internships, and all those other things. That's a no brainer. I mean, just imagine how Ivy League universities would respond or how they've responded in other situations. This one is one of the most egregious things you can imagine. And yet, they're so quiet with it. I will tell you this, though, Brian, in Florida, if you look at the statements that were put out by the University of Florida President, Florida State president, they came out very strongly against Hamas and very strongly in favor of Israel and our Jewish students. And I was proud to see that. We've worked really hard to get our universities away from being indoctrination centers and focusing on the classical mission of pursuing truth and preparing our kids to be citizens of the Republic. And I think you see it paying off in how they responded to this.
On how President DeSantis would reverse Biden's disastrous foreign policies:
The terrorism that has been fomented in the Middle East in the last 25 years, overwhelmingly, has been Iran. I mean, when I was in Iraq serving on active duty, there's a lot of attention on the Sunni jihadists, the al Qaeda in Iraq, and they were a force, but most of our own combat deaths at the time were from Iranian-funded militias, people that were directed by Soleimani. So they have a lot of American blood on their hands. They did the Beirut bombing on our Marines in '83. They funded Hezbollah on that. This is just what they do. So, what Biden needs to do, he needs to reverse his policies that have given sustenance to the regime, put them in a financial box -- that's one of the reasons I want to increase our energy production at home. Because when we're energy dominant, that's bad for Russia, Iran, China, and Venezuela. If you pursue a green New Deal in this country, just understand, you are benefiting Iran, you are benefiting Russia, you are benefiting China. So, reversing the nation's energy policy, being independent and dominant, I think is very important. But I think it's choking them off on that. And I do think getting a Saudi-Israeli peace deal, I think it's complicated now, given what's going on, but I think Biden dropped the ball on that. He could have done that in his first year. That creates the front of the Gulf Arab states, Israel, and the United States against Iran. It makes it harder for the Iranians to do what they want to do in the region when you have a united front.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Campaign Launches Veterans for DeSantis,2023-10-18T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-campaign-launches-veterans-for-desantis,"
DeSantis Would Be First Veteran to Serve in War Elected Since 1988 
Tallahasee, FL - Ron DeSantis, the only veteran in the race for president, launched his Veterans for DeSantis Coalition today. The coalition features a National Leadership Team as well as grassroots veterans from across the country who will share how DeSantis's military service and vision to reverse America's decline make him the best suited to serve as Commander-in-Chief.
The governor will hold the first of a series of ""Veterans for DeSantis"" events in Anderson, South Carolina on Thursday, October 19. The coalition launch follows the plan DeSantis released during the summer to rip the woke out of the military and restore it to ""mission first.""
DeSantis tapped Congressman Rich McCormick (R-GA), a decorated USMC and U.S. Navy veteran, to lead the Veterans for DeSantis National Leadership Team.
""We need a Commander-In-Chief who has worn the flag on his sleeve, and truly understands what it means to put service above self. We need a President with a track record of accomplishments, focused on tackling the challenges that plague our families and communities, and unapologetically committed to our conservative values. I am proud to endorse Governor DeSantis and serve on his National Leadership Team because he has proven himself to be a servant leader who never backs down from a fight. We can trust Ron DeSantis to lead, succeed, and always put the American people first."" - Congressman Richard McCormick, former Commander, U.S. Navy.
""Ron DeSantis was the smartest Naval Officer and one of the most selfless individuals with whom I ever served. I was his Commanding Officer in the Navy and now, I want him to be our commander-in-chief."" - Dan Bean, Captain, U.S. Navy
""In today's increasingly volatile world, America needs a strong leader who understands the gravity of this responsibility to each service-member, and this nation. As a veteran, who has served our nation in a combat zone, Ron DeSantis is ready to stand up and fight for this nation on day one."" - Florida State Senator Jay Collins, First Sergeant, U.S. Army
Veterans for DeSantis is the fourth coalition that the DeSantis campaign has launched to date, following Mamas for DeSantis, Law Enforcement for DeSantis, and DeSantis' Faith and Family Coalition.
Ron DeSantis stands out as the only veteran on either side of the aisle in the 2024 presidential race. After watching the Twin Towers collapse in a terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, DeSantis felt called to serve. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he volunteered to join the US Navy and later volunteered to deploy to Iraq alongside SEAL Team One as a JAG officer. He was awarded the Bronze Star for his service.

""South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott blasted media outlets for spreading Hamas' claim that an Israeli missile struck a Gaza hospital killing hundreds — which Israel has flatly denied — and called progressive members of the so-called Squad ""disgusting"" for spreading what he called 'propaganda.'
""'Frankly, I know we shouldn't expect more from the Squad, but The Squad becoming an extension of the Hamas propaganda machine, it is disgraceful, and it is costly,' the GOP presidential candidate told Fox News Digital by phone on Wednesday.
""'I think we should be very careful to allow it any daylight.'...
""'It's just disgusting, to be honest with you, I can't think of a clearer word,' Scott told Fox News Digital. 'Not only is it misinformed and wrongheaded, but it's deadly.'
""'This morning, I started thinking about the fact that now Israel's going to have to fight a war, a second war, but it is a war against information, and this could be the most dangerous war, because this war has real consequences, and we're seeing the consequences immediately taking the word of an evil, lying terrorist organization.'...
""'Hezbollah is mobilizing, there's been a specific and clear attempt led by Hamas to weaken Israel's standing, and when the media buys into that, it creates a misinformation war that could be more deadly than the actual physical war.'...
""'These are dangerous times, and part of that being led by members of Congress, having one flying the Palestinian flag the last time I checked in the halls of Congress, paid for by the American taxpayers,' Scott said, referring to the Palestinian flag hanging outside of Tlaib's office.
""'That's a dangerous mixed message to send right now.'""...

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: We Cannot Have Members Of Congress Being Propaganda Machines For Hamas,2023-10-18T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-we-cannot-have-members-congress-being-propaganda,"
NEW YORK, NY – Tonight, Tim Scott joined Fox News on Hannity to slam the silence of the Squad and mainstream media following their disgusting spread of false Hamas propaganda.
WATCH HERE
Sean Hannity: You saw Congresswoman Tlaib. You see the tweets of Congresswoman Omar. You see the media in this country. They were all racing to blame Israel with no evidence.
Tim Scott: Yes. Absolutely insane. One of the reasons why I spoke on the floor of the Senate today was to send a message. When they thought it was Israel who shot the rocket, they were all up in flames. Everybody was coming out against them. The media, the New York Times, AP, and the Squad. When they found out that maybe it wasn't, quiet as a church mouse. It's unbelievable how disgusting the reaction is when they think it's Israel. And then how amazingly quiet- No coverage. No denying. And frankly, I asked from the floor, delete the tweet. Delete the tweet.
We cannot have members of Congress being a part of the propaganda machine for Hamas. It's undeniably crazy. We deserve better.
Sean Hannity: Do you agree with me that the hundred million dollars that Joe promised to go to the Palestinians, do you agree with me, all that money's going straight to Hamas?
Tim Scott: Listen, one of the reasons why I'm leading legislation with Senator Ricketts is to stop sending money into Gaza until Israel cleans it out. You just can't do that. Money is fungible. The one thing that we know without any question, you send money, even if you have good intentions, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Stop it. Let's not get involved there. Let's stand shoulder to shoulder and back to back with Israel. Give them the time to eliminate Hamas from the face of the planet before you do anything else.

""I will say without any question, our job is to make sure the American Dream is alive and well for the next generation."" – Tim Scott
COLUMBIA, SC – On Monday, Tim Scott returned to his home state to officially file for the 2024 South Carolina presidential primary ballot. Tim was joined by an enthusiastic room of Midlands supporters as he made his candidacy official in Columbia, South Carolina.
At the event, Tim emphasized the value of American citizenship and the importance of securing the American Dream for future generations. He also responded to the ongoing war in Israel, declaring we must wipe Hamas off the map.
""The harder we work, the luckier we get,"" said Tim Scott. ""We continue to have a positive message, one anchored in conservative principles. We need a candidate who will restore hope, create opportunities, and unite our country. I thank God that I'm that candidate.""
Mary Green: SC Sen Tim Scott files with the SCGOP to appear on the ballot for SC's Feb. 24 Republican presidential primary — chants of ""Tim! Tim! Tim!"" broke out from supporters here to see it at Doc's BBQ in Columbia.
ABC Columbia: ""He will bring our country together. He will do much to heal the racial divides because he's seen what can happen, and the potential and positiveness that can grow. And he's a man of faith and that's very important to me,"" said a Lexington voter.
Chizi Owiriwa, a graduate of the University of South Carolina, says he initially backed Nikki Haley, but is now all in for Scott.
""His persona is really good. He knows how to take charge. He knows how to fight for people. He knows how to be a voice for the generation. He's a proud South Carolinian. He's a person of faith and that's what we need in these times,"" Owiriwa said.

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Tim Scott joined The Lead with Jake Tapper to denounce the atrocities conducted by Hamas on the Israeli people. Tim condemned growing anti-Semitism and supported the effort to wipe out Hamas.
WATCH HERE
Jake Tapper: So let's talk about the conflict in the Middle East. We're still learning more about the cause of this hospital blast. It's believed to have killed hundreds of people in Gaza. If you were president of the United States right now, how do you think you would be handling this crisis?
Tim Scott: Well, the first thing you do is make sure that there's no daylight between America and Israel. I would say standing shoulder to shoulder and back to back with no daylight is so important. And what we saw is an atrocity that just makes your heart sick. Evil brought upon the Jewish people in Israel with Hamas' objective to eliminate Jews on earth, not just Israel, but everywhere. There are 6 million in America. We've seen anti-Semitism continue to grow. We have a lot of work to do. One of the ways that we help is to make sure that we support Prime Minister Netanyahu's efforts in wiping Hamas off the map. I'm thankful for the way that he has started the process, which is to send the signal into Gaza to get out. Being very specific gives civilians an access opportunity. A way out is something that was not afforded to the people of Israel.

COLUMBIA, SC – Tim Scott joined The Sean Hannity Show today to strongly condemn the anti-Israel demonstrations taking place on college campuses across the country. Tim also outlined the need to revoke visas for foreign nationals who support terrorism. He reaffirmed the United States' obligation to stand with Israel and eliminate the existential threat posed by Hamas.
Earlier today, Tim was joined by Midlands voters as he officially filed for the 2024 South Carolina presidential primary ballot.
LISTEN HERE
Sean Hannity: I wish it wasn't happening. I can wish all day. I wish there wasn't evil in the world, but we both know that there is. We've seen the images. I guess one of the most shocking things to come out post this was what was happening on Friday, and that is these massive protests. I'm sure you saw the images in Times Square, it looked like New Year's Eve, and, you know, people without the moral clarity to see that Israel was the victim of a terror attack. And you know, all these people died, over 1,300 Israelis. If you compare their population to ours, it would be the equivalent of 38,000. And people support Hamas. I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around that Senator.
Sen Scott: Sean, I gotta tell you, it was devastating to see people in our own country marching and celebrating an absolute terrorist organization for the annihilation of our Jewish brothers and sisters. Hamas wants to wipe Israel off the map, but they don't stop there. There are two more steps. The second step is to eliminate all Jews anywhere on the planet, and the third is to compromise and then destroy Western democracies. And I gotta tell you, if any of those students on college campuses are foreign nationals on a visa, they should be sent back to their country. Anyone who stands up and who says they want to kill Jews, they support terrorism. They should have that visa revoked....
I'll tell you, I think we have, we're living in an alternate universe where the radical Left continues to sow seeds of division and polarization, and they want to have a story about the oppressor and the oppressed. We've seen that. I've said this so many times, Sean, the fact is that the radical Left will use anybody, any group, any issue to hold onto their power. Here at home, they want to divide America on racial lines and on class lines and globally, they want to put people in positions of being the oppressor, and they come to the defense of the oppressed, no matter how inconsistent with human history that story actually is. And that's exactly what they're doing. This is where the indoctrination of our young people versus the education of our young people is so important. We have to stop indoctrinating college students and high school students that America is evil, or that Western democracies are somehow oppressors.

""How do we make sure that our nation remains the greatest nation on God's green Earth if we have no ability to discern who's coming in our country?"" – Tim Scott 
WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Tim Scott joined a foreign policy and national security conversation hosted by Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service. During the discussion, Tim disagreed with other GOP presidential candidates who considered accepting Gaza refugees amidst Hamas' ongoing terrorist attacks on Israel.
LISTEN HERE
Meg Kinnard: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis yesterday said the U.S. shouldn't take in anyone from Gaza, calling them all anti-Semitic. What's your reaction to those comments?
Tim Scott: Well, I don't know that they're all anti-Semitic without any question. They are Semites. But I don't think that they're all anti-Semitic. I just can't tell you who's who. And part of the challenge that we have from a refugee perspective is coming to a conclusion: who's safe to bring in, who's not safe to bring in? If you cannot make that decision, and I cannot make that decision as Commander-in-Chief, I would not be able to in the midst of this conflict. So I would say we're not bringing anyone. No refugees in from Gaza, period. I think that's the right decision, not because I think they're all anti-Semitic, but I can't tell the difference. And I do know that the majority of the Palestinians support Hamas based on all the latest polling that I've seen since 2021. So the truth is, if I can't figure out who you are, you can't come in the country. There are other candidates, Nikki Haley has come to a different decision than Ron DeSantis. She believes that it's permissible, it appears, to allow folks in. That's a moderate part of the Republican Party.
Meg Kinnard: No, she said that there is a way to ascertain.
Tim Scott: Yeah. How?
Meg Kinnard: That's what she said.
Tim Scott: Yeah. I just wanna know how? ... So the truth of the matter is that when you think about these policy positions, the one thing we have to ask ourselves is how does this impact everyday Americans? How do we make sure that our nation remains the greatest nation on God's green Earth if we have no ability to discern who's coming in our country? I can't figure that out. If I can't figure that out as Commander-in-Chief, I have a responsibility to take a leap back and say, ""not on my watch.""
Our nation is just too important for me to make bad decisions under pressure because I want to be popular. That doesn't work for me. And the best thing we can do as we say it in the South, is hold up, hold up, hold up until we get it right. And in my opinion, you can't get there from here. Therefore, not having any of the refugees come into our country is the right decision. And by the way, Iran has lots of room, they have lots of funds and they have a lot of culpability. Other countries can handle in the Middle East the challenges that we're seeing.
Meg Kinnard: Okay. So essentially for this point in time, that's not something that the U.S. should be, in your perspective as Commander-in-Chief, the U.S. shouldn't be involved with anybody from the region?
Tim Scott: Correct. From a refugee standpoint, correct. Correct.

"Op-Ed by Tim Scott in The Hill: As president, I will restore peace though American strength",2023-10-15T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/op-ed-tim-scott-the-hill-president-i-will-restore-peace-though-american-strength,"
The Hill Opinion
October 14, 2023
The hearts and minds of the American people are filled with heartbreak and righteous anger for our friends and allies, the people of Israel.
The terrorist attacks on innocent children, women and men were disgusting. A music festival turned into a killing field. Babies beheaded, bodies paraded around like trophies, and women and children thrown into the back of trucks and kidnapped. The world has been brought face-to-face with pure evil.
America stands with Israel in sorrow, in solidarity and in strong resolve that these heinous acts of war will not go unanswered or unpunished.
It is not enough for President Biden to condemn these despicable attacks now that they've taken place, as he rightly did on Tuesday. Our commander-in-chief needs to stop making massive policy misjudgments that embolden our enemies, alienate our allies and make horrible attacks like these more likely.
President Obama's own defense secretary, Robert Gates, famously said that Joe Biden was on the wrong side of every major question in foreign policy and national security for 40 years. So, tragically, it is no surprise that President Biden's term has been a disaster for our security, our vital interests and our allies — particularly in the Middle East. The president's humiliating Afghanistan surrender cost 13 servicemembers their lives and cost our nation credibility and deterrence. It signaled to terrorists that this administration will allow the United States to be outfought, outsmarted and outlasted. Or look at President Biden's massive blunder just before Putin invaded Ukraine, bizarrely stating that just a ""minor incursion"" might not be too bad.
Time after time, the Biden administration has revealed a lack of backbone — and bad actors around the world smelled blood in the water. It's not just hesitation or incompetence. It's a series of systematic mistakes based on a backward worldview.
The last time Biden was part of an administration, he and President Obama sent pallets of cash to Iran, rewarding Tehran for supporting terrorism and pursuing nuclear weapons. Republicans warned that Iran's terrorist proxies, including Hamas, would reap some of the windfall. But the political left was so desperate to cuddle up to Iran, they didn't care whether Israel's enemies got to line their pockets.
More recently, during his own presidential term, Biden has taken one opportunity after another to create daylight between the United States and Israel. He has meddled in Israel's domestic politics. He practically made Prime Minister Netanyahu beg for a White House invitation that should have been automatic. Just a few weeks ago, President Biden made the now-infamous decision to unfreeze $6 billion more for Iran. That is fungible money for a terrorist-funding state. Iran's president has already declared the regime will spend the funds however they please.
Even after the stomach-churning attacks on Israel, the Biden administration blunders have just kept coming. Both the administration's newly established Office of Palestinian Affairs and Secretary of State Blinken made online postings that tried to tie our ally's hands by demanding a premature ceasefire. Both posts were deleted after backlash.
It is embarrassing and absurd that President Biden held a staff picnic at the White House as Hamas held American citizens hostage. It is unacceptable that he ended his public workday at lunchtime on Monday amid this crisis.
We need a tough, capable, full-time commander in chief who is loyal to our allies, lethal to our adversaries and understands that the road to peace runs through American strength.
As president, I will bring back a Middle East policy that treats our friends like friends and enemies like enemies. I will stop desperately chasing bad deals with Iran, and strengthen and extend our sanctions instead. I will shut off the funding that Joe Biden restarted to the UN's irredeemably flawed Palestinian aid programs — because the best investment we can make in peace and stability is backing Israel 100 percent. I will rebuild and reinvest in American military dominance, so the arsenal of freedom is fully stocked for ourselves and our allies. And I will put terrorists across the world on notice with one simple policy: If you take an American life, it is guaranteed to cost you yours.
Finally, while we watch this devastation that is fueled in part by President Biden's retreat from peace through strength, Republicans must not head down the same mistaken path.
Vivek Ramaswamy has said the definition of success is reducing America's support for Israel. At one point, he proposed that we let the Chinese Communist Party take over Taiwan as long as we relocate some factories first. Gov. Ron DeSantis once dismissed Russia's invasion of Ukraine as just some ""territorial dispute."" Some voices on the right have begun talking about America like we're a declining country, a failing empire, that needs to cut our losses and pull up the drawbridge.
That idea is dead wrong — and it's dangerous. The last thing the Republican Party needs is a Joe Biden wing on foreign policy. As President Reagan once said, ""Of the four wars in my lifetime, none came about because the United States was too strong.""
The American people are not in decline. American courage and values aren't in decline. We're just stuck with a weak president who is in retreat. All we need to do is turn around.
I am running for president to stop the Biden retreat, restore peace through strength and double down on American power. Only a strong and confident America will be positioned to help our friends in Israel say, ""never again.""

""We have all hands on deck on this. It's important. This is a once in a generation type of thing. And so, for the state of Florida to step up honestly, it's the least we can do.""
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Fox News' Harris Faulkner for an interview on The Faulkner Focus today. The highlights are below.
Watch PART 1 and PART 2.
On how he is taking action to bring Americans home from Israel:
People weren't able to get out and you heard that. And then the administration finally, yesterday said, we can maybe fly into Europe and just dump you there. But people want to come back to the United States. And so, our state of Florida, we've got really strong ties with Israel. We have the second largest Israeli-American population. We have a strong Jewish population. But we also have a lot of folks who visit Israel as part of their church congregations, and there's people that are on trips there. So, there are definitely hundreds of Floridians who are stranded there. We don't want to just sit and wait. I don't want to see them dumped in Europe. I want to bring them back to the state of Florida. So, we have planes ready, we're working with the Israeli government now to be able to land those in Israel and then take people back to the safety and security of the state of Florida. So, look, we deal with crises in Florida all the time, we deal with hurricanes, we deal with other things. This is just something that we do. We're ready. And I think we're going to be in a situation where we'll be working with Israeli leadership to get it done.
On the details of Florida's evacuation flights:
Well, it's a variety. And you know, we have different vendors, and we contract with different people. It's also the case that Israel may limit the size of the plane that can go into Ben Gurion Airport. So you may have to do a short flight out of the country and then get people on the bigger plane. So we're working through all those details. But, and we also, we wanted to get a flight lifted off prior to Shabbat, so the Sabbath. We didn't do it, but we also know there are people there from Florida who are not Jewish at all, they don't observe the Sabbath, and so if we're able to do something over the next 24 hours while they're in Sabbath, we can take some of those people who are willing to travel. But we definitely think sundown on Saturday night, we anticipate seeing a lot more. So if the planes are ready by then, you're going to see a lot of people be able to be brought back hopefully relatively quickly. So, we have all hands on deck on this. It's important. This is a once in a generation type of thing. And so, for the state of Florida the step up, honestly, it's kind of the least we can do.

Tallahassee, FL - The DeSantis campaign tonight released the following statement in response to the Trump team's pathetic attempt to clean up Donald Trump's comments praising Hezbollah and attacking Israel:
""No matter what rhetorical gymnastics act his campaign team tries to perform to attempt to once again cover for him, nobody can change the fact that last night Donald Trump showed his true colors by insulting Israelis during one of their darkest hours and simultaneously complimenting one of the terrorist groups that continue to pose a grave threat to Israelis and Americans alike. It is disturbing and disqualifying."" - Communications Director Andrew Romeo

""We need to all be on the same page, now's not the time to air personal grievances about an Israeli prime minister. Now's the time to support their right to defend themselves to the hilt."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis was greeted by an energetic crowd of supporters at the New Hampshire Statehouse this afternoon as he became the first major candidate to file candidacy paperwork in the Granite State.
As he spoke to members of the press after the filing, DeSantis said the U.S should take back the $6 billion Biden sent to Iran, and he blasted Donald Trump for praising Hezbollah and attacking Israel. Watch his remarks HERE.
""In terms of the depravity of human nature, the President needs to understand that Iran is ultimately the funder of this type of terrorism, he should take back that $6 billion that they had prepared to give, and he should also tighten the screws financially with the oil revenue, use all the tools at your disposal, because the money that goes into that regime, they're not using it to create a better life for the people of Iran. They're using it to fund terrorism. And we know that and we have known that and he should not be under the delusion you're going to have a rapprochement with Iran.
I also think given the situation there, now's not the time to be doing, like what Donald Trump did, attacking Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, attacking Israel's defense minister, saying somehow that Hezbollah were very smart. We need to all be on the same page, now's not the time to air personal grievances about an Israeli prime minister. Now's the time to support their right to defend themselves to the hilt.
I think this situation in Israel should make our domestic situation all the more urgent with the open border that we've been living through. And I've been talking about for a long time. As Governor of Florida, I've taken action in a variety of ways. As a candidate, I put out the boldest plan to deal with it. If you don't think that our enemies are going to exploit or have exploited that border, then I don't know what to tell you. We know people that come from China, from Russia, from Iran from other parts of the Middle East, to come across illegally into our country. And so it's been a great vulnerability. The President needs to reverse course on his policy, this will be a Day One issue that we're able to take care of as President. And I've said, Republicans have been talking about this for so long. They talked about building the wall, having Mexico pay all this stuff, and even before that, and it's just never gotten done. And so now's the time to bring it to a conclusion. And that's exactly what we'll do.""

Tallahassee, FL - Faith leaders from across the country supporting Ron DeSantis are speaking out today to condemn Donald Trump's comments praising Hezbollah and criticizing Israel.
""America has always been a nation that stands with and blesses Israel with our actions and words. God said of Israel in Genesis 12:3, 'And I will bless those who bless you.' The former President's criticisms of Israel's IDF and its country's leadership at a time like this are revealing, shocking, and very concerning."" – Pastor Joseph Brown, Marion Baptist Church (Washington, Iowa)
""This is another one in a long line of the former president's moral equivocations regarding enemies of America and our allies. The fundamental problem is his lack of a coherent and truth based worldview. In the same speech, he praised Chairman Xi and chided Israeli leaders, while giving rhetorical air support to an Iranian backed terrorist organization. The Bible says we're to know the signs of the times and it seems like our former president doesn't understand that."" – Matt Wells, Lay Leader, Marion Baptist Church (Washington, Iowa)
""In the midst of barbaric acts of evil, the former president opted to see admirable qualities in our enemy while exercising a personal grudge against the leader of our great ally. Times such as these demand selfless, visionary leadership, not self-centered, capitulating vanity."" – Cole Muzio, Frontline Policy Center (Atlanta, Georgia)
""Israel's darkest hour of our lifetime is upon us. As a nation founded on Judeo-Christian values, we must project a unified message to the barbaric leaders of Hamas. Trump's disparaging comments about PM Netanyahu are damaging and must be condemned. Our Lord said, ""a house divided against itself cannot stand."" I praise Gov. DeSantis for providing the necessary leadership on a world stage that otherwise would be void."" – Pastor Mark Doland, Church of Christ (Toledo, Iowa)
""I strongly condemn any expression of support or praise for organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas that have been involved in violence, evil, and destabilization in the Middle East. It is crucial to maintain a strong relationship with our ally Israel, to find lasting solutions to the complex challenges in the region. The fact that a former President would speak in such a manner regarding our closest ally is disturbing and should be condemned. The Jewish people are the people of God and need our support. We need leaders like Ron DeSantis who will unequivocally stand with Israel."" – Pastor Seth Wilkins, Grace Baptist Church (Orangeburg, South Carolina)
""This is a time for unity in standing with Israel as it mourns and prepares to do battle with the perpetrators of a heinous crime against humanity."" – Tevi Troy, Bestselling Author, Former Deputy Secretary of HHS, & Former White House Jewish Liaison
""The comments by former President Trump are inappropriate and wrong. His critical remarks do nothing to support our most trusted ally and friend in its greatest time of need. Praising the same barbarians who deny Israel the right to even exist, and who are attacking Israel as we speak, is dangerous and only legitimizes these terrorists' organizations in the eyes of the world."" – Jay S. Zeidman, Managing Partner of Altitude Ventures
""When leaders choose to enact evil upon others, it should never be called smart. Real leaders condemn evil, leaving no room for rationalizations. The dangers and atrocities in our world today call for the clear, smart, moral leadership of Governor Desantis. I'm disappointed Former President Trump hasn't figured that out yet."" – Pastor & Representative Jon Dunwell (Newton, Iowa)

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott On CBS Mornings: We Know Hamas Thanked Iran For Their Support,2023-10-11T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-cbs-mornings-we-know-hamas-thanked-iran-for-their,"
WASHINGTON, DC – Tim Scott joined CBS Mornings to discuss Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israel and Iran's role in funding Hamas. Yesterday, Tim delivered a speech on Israel at the Hudson Institute, where he made ""scathing critiques"" of Biden, the Squad, and dangerous Republican foreign policy.
WATCH HERE
Sen Scott: One of the things that we should put in context for the American viewer is that 1,200 dead in Israel is like 40,000 killed in America. What we know without any question is that there cannot be a hint of daylight between us, the United States of America, and Israel as they respond to this attack. That is absolutely essential that they know we have their backs. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel, number one. Number two, we need to make sure that they have all the resources that they need. The good news, Gayle, is over the last 10 years, we've had a strong partnership with Israel and their military. So we know they have the resources, but there will be a desperate need as this pulls out and goes on. We'll have to be in the position to refill some of the assets and resources that will be depleted along the way....
Sen Scott: Well, here's what we know without any question. Hamas thanked Iran for their support and their assistance. We know that for sure. We know that the president of Iran said, without any question, the $6 billion will be used any way we want. We also know, we can see it reinforced throughout the globe that when there's weakness in the White House, there's blood in the streets, whether that's in Ukraine, when President Biden said a small incursion might not be that big of a deal, when he said to Putin, if you cyber attacks some areas just don't cyber attack these areas, and frankly, when you negotiate and give $6 billion, you create a market for hostages. And the response to that has been Iran has, and Hamas working together without much of a question. 90% of the money that comes into Hamas comes from Iran.

Washington Examiner: Israel war: Pence's peace-through-strength priorities are crucial now and forever
""With Hamas's terrorism against Israel dominating the news this week, former Vice President Mike Pence looks all the wiser in having spent the three prior weeks spreading Reaganite wisdom about defense and foreign policy.
""Pence understands that the safety and interests of Americans are best protected through American engagement, American leadership, American toughness, American arms, American support for allies, and American military might. That combination actually makes it less likely, not more, that American fighters actually will face combat — and less likely that American civilians will be threatened or their livelihoods hampered or destroyed.
""No matter who wins the presidency, the U.S. will be better off if Pence's principles and priorities govern the diplomacy and defense policies used in the Oval Office.""

""The strongest decision we can make is to have a president who understands the Reagan Doctrine of peace through strength is necessary."" – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Earlier this week in South Carolina, Tim Scott held campaign stops across his home state from the Lowcountry to the Upstate.
Last Friday, Tim drew an overflow crowd in Bluffton as he took questions from voters and declared the need for a united Republican Party. On Monday, Tim stopped by Stax's Original Restaurant in Greenville to greet Palmetto State voters.
Following the tragic terrorist attacks on Israel, Tim led a coalition of faith leaders in prayer for the Israeli people. He called out Joe Biden for enabling Iran-backed terrorism and urged the United States to lead with strength.
Post and Courier: An estimated 300 people jammed in shoulder-to-shoulder for the chance to hear Scott. Another 100 remained outside, unable to squeeze in...
""He's got a conservative approach,"" Bluffton resident Ray Morris said. ""He's a constitutional Republican and believes in the things I believe.""
WJCL: ""Being home is wonderful. Having the opportunity to talk to the people face to face is a really important part of the engagement,"" Scott said.

""The challenge that we see today is that when you give $6 billion to people who fund terrorism, you cannot be surprised when they go and do what they always have done."" – Tim Scott 
DES MOINES, IA – Tonight, Tim Scott joined Sean Hannity on Fox News to discuss Tim's new Senate bill that would immediately refreeze the $6 billion that Joe Biden and his administration gave to Iran. Tim and Sean also discussed the barbaric terrorist attacks from Hamas on innocent people and the importance of making sure that Iran is never a nuclear power.
Yesterday, Tim delivered a speech on Israel at the Hudson Institute, where he made ""scathing critiques"" of Biden, the Squad, and dangerous Republican foreign policy.
WATCH HERE
Sean Hannity: The fact that you, Marsha Blackburn and others have to have to put forward a bill. Why hasn't Joe Biden already said you're not getting the 6 billion? Why are they so reluctant and resistant to the idea that that was a bad deal and a bad idea? That giving the number one state sponsor terror this money, why do we, why do we have to force that upon them? That should be, to me, a no-brainer.
Tim Scott: You know that you cannot make a good deal with a bad actor, period. One of the things I've been saying since Saturday is that Joe Biden is complicit with these attacks. Why? Because when you are weak, you invite attacks. When you negotiate and give $6 billion to Iran, who is 90% of the funding for Hamas comes from Iran. Those breadcrumbs are simple. It is impossible for the common person to come to any other conclusion. But in Washington, DC Joe Biden and his administration – they are uncommon and not in a good way. The challenge that we see today is that when you give $6 billion to people who fund terrorism, you cannot be surprised when they go and do what they always have done. But I gotta say this, Sean, when $6 billion is paid for hostages, you have actually created a high-value market for Americans to be taken as hostages. And we pray that they come home and we should do everything in our power to bring them home. But this administration has blood on their hands because they are complicit. We need to freeze those assets and send a message to the world that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel. And there is no daylight. But if you take an American hostage, it should cost you your life.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on The Story With Martha MacCallum,2023-10-11T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-the-story-with-martha-maccallum,"
""For whatever reason this administration wants to bend over backwards to not hold Iran accountable."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Fox News' Martha MacCallum on The Story today. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On the Biden Administration's unwillingness to hold Iran accountable:
Well, Hamas and Hezbollah for that matter, they are just proxies for Iran. Those groups wouldn't exist without Iranian patronage. And so, an attack like this is not going to happen without support and direction from the Mullahs in Iran. So we should know that. I think the reporting on that by different outlets has been accurate. For whatever reason, this administration wants to bend over backwards to not hold Iran accountable. Of course, when they came in, they loosened up on sanctions, Iran's had more money going to the regime as a result of that, and they have had this delusion that you could somehow have a rapprochement with Iran. You are not going to have a rapprochement with Iran, they live for terrorism. This is what they want to do. And it's been disappointing to see since this happened, I mean, Biden slept through the initial attack. They didn't even wake him up on Saturday morning. He was missing an action for most of the weekend, you know, finally made a statement yesterday, but we clearly need leadership and he's not providing it.
On the need to stand with Israel as they annihilate Hamas:
Well, first, I would just say with respect to Israel, they have every right to defend themselves, and that means the complete annihilation of Hamas and the terror networks and infrastructure. You're going to start to see people attack Israel. You're going to start to see maybe even the United Nations, and some of these as time goes on. It's important that America plants that flag in the ground that we're with them thick through thin on their right to defend themselves. I think you move very quickly to shut off flows of money to Iran. The oil money is a big part for them. I would counter that by drilling for more oil here in the United States and make us the dominate energy producer in the United States. We could do that if we wanted to; Biden doesn't want to do that. So, I think the financial constraints on Iran will help crimp their ability to fund terrorism in the Middle East. And then of course, anything that Israel needs, we have a long-standing security relationship with them. We want to be supportive of their efforts.
On protecting American citizens as Commander-in-Chief:
I would protect the American citizens who are potentially being held captive or in harm's way. That is a responsibility of the Commander in Chief. We don't know how many Americans are being held hostage, but we have forces that are dedicated that. We would definitely do that. And then you take whatever appropriate action there is in the region. I would say, though, those types of groups -- the Hamas and the Hezbollah -- in direct contact with US troops, they typically don't fare very well. They would be trying to do some type of sneak attack like they did with the Beirut barracks bombing in 1983, which, by the way, was also funded and orchestrated by Iran.
On the special relationship between the United States and Israel:
I think Israel is a unique ally for us. They're our top ally in the Middle East. They're a country that we can depend on when the chips are down for us. Heck, even as governor, we had the collapse of the Surfside tower down in South Florida in a heavily Jewish area. As our fire rescue were on the pile, I had the IDF come and help us in South Florida. So that's a special relationship, and I think it's something that the Congress has got to be mindful of. I think they should debate this on the merits. I don't think they should play games, parliamentary games. Hopefully we'll be able to get somebody seated as speaker so we can start getting the Congress functioning again because I can tell you, seeing a lot of the disorder up there, it doesn't inspire confidence. I think you got to get the job done. That's what we do in Florida. We just deliver results, but the fanfare and the chaos, I think, needs to stop.

Remarks at the Hudson Institute,2023-10-10T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/remarks-the-hudson-institute,"
[As prepared for delivery.]
The hearts and minds of the American people have been filled with heartbreak and righteous anger for our friends and allies, the people of Israel.
The terrorist attacks on innocent children, women, and men were disgusting.
A music festival, turned into a killing field. 
Women and children thrown into trucks and kidnapped.
The bodies of the innocent paraded around the streets like trophies.
Hundreds upon hundreds are dead or still missing. 
A thousand deaths in Israel is 36,000 in America. 
New reports this morning suggest that dozens of babies have been found beheaded. Pure evil…
And the murder victims and the hostages include American citizens.
America stands with Israel in sorrow… in solidarity… and in strength of resolve that these heinous acts of war will not go unanswered and will not go unpunished.
Our nation is founded on the Judeo-Christian rock. As a Christian, I believe we first follow Romans 12:15 and mourn with those who mourn. And our prayers are with the people of Israel.
But we must also stand shoulder to shoulder with our friends when it is time to turn the page to Romans 13:4 — ""if you do wrong, be afraid… for God's servants are agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.""
These despicable acts deserve nothing less than the full measure of justice.
The people behind them need to feel the wrath of God. And they need to meet some Israeli or American military hardware to help them on their way.
***
It is not enough for the United States of America to condemn this kind of aggression.
We need leaders who will stop inviting this kind of aggression.
President Obama's own defense secretary famously said that Joe Biden was on the wrong side of every major question in foreign policy and national security for 40 years. 
So tragically, it is no surprise that President Biden's term has been a disaster for our security, our vital interests, and our allies. Particularly in the Middle East.
Every time, they have chosen weakness and appeasement… every time America has been passive… it has sent the most dangerous signal to bad actors everywhere.
American hesitation, American weakness, smells like one thing to bad actors. It smells like blood in the water.
Look at President Biden's humiliating surrender in Afghanistan. It cost 13 servicemembers their lives and cost us credibility and deterrence. It signaled to terrorists that with a little bit of effort, this Administration will allow the United States to be outfought, outsmarted, and outlasted. 
Look at Biden telling Putin just before he invaded Ukraine that a ""minor incursion"" might not be so bad.
Time after time, Joe Biden has revealed a lack of backbone.
It's not just hesitation or incompetence. It's a pattern of foolish policy choices that have undermined us and our allies.
The last time Joe Biden was part of an Administration, he and President Obama sent pallets of cash to Iran — rewarding Tehran while supporting terrorism and pursuing nuclear weapons. 
Republicans shouted from the rooftops that Iran's terrorist proxies including Hamas and Hezbollah were going to reap part of the windfall.
But the left wanted so desperately to cozy up to Iran.
They didn't care how much American money ended up in the pockets of Israel's enemies.
Just a few weeks ago, President Biden sent the same signal again. He rewarded Iran for taking American hostages by unlocking $6 billion for the mullahs.
The Administration swears the money can only be spent on humanitarian aid. How naïve can you be? Money is fungible. We just gave a terrorist-supporting regime billions of dollars and room in its budget. The president of Iran came right out and said they'll spend that money however they want.
And it's not just Biden's weakness and appeasement towards Iran.
This Administration has also found other ways to create daylight between us and Israel.
Joe Biden has interfered in Israeli domestic politics and tried to weaken Prime Minister Netanyahu.
He slow-walked inviting him to the White House and practically made him beg for that invitation while the world looked on.
As if, Israel is a second-class ally that he is stuck with. And the thugs and the killers took notice.
Even after these historic attacks, the Biden Administration's newly-established Office of Palestinian Affairs published a statement that tried to tie Israel's hands by saying, quote, ""all sides"" should refrain from further action.
They had to delete the post after a backlash. Lord, have mercy.
There is no both sides. There's no moral equivalency. We're talking about terrorists killing innocent people. There is right and there is wrong. It's black and white. And there should be no doubt where our loyalties lie. 
We have seen the face of evil.
The President of the United States has a moral duty to lead with strength and clarity.
So while Hamas carried out these attacks… Joe Biden has blood on his hands.
His weakness invited the attack.
His cash giveaways to Iran helped fund terrorism.
And after the attack his Administration suggested Israel should stand down.
It's a disgrace.
We need a President who is loyal to our allies and lethal to our adversaries. 
Because weakness never buys you peace. 
Being passive is provocation.
President Reagan once said, ""of the four wars in his lifetime, none came about because the United States was too strong."" 
Safety takes readiness and resolve. Security requires strength.
***
So why have two consecutive Democrat Administrations behaved this way?
Republicans won the historic victories of the Abraham Accords and brought Israel and the Arab world closer together. Why did the Biden Democrats waste no time reversing that progress and disrespecting our ally?
The answer is simple — and it's disturbing.
The far left in this country has become incredibly hostile to the state of Israel. The most extreme statements have become a daily routine. They even dabble openly in anti-Semitism.
But President Biden will not stand up to them. Because he cares more about his own power. 
This past weekend, Congresswoman Cori Bush put out a statement suggesting the Palestinians are equal victims and calling Israel a ""military occupation"" and ""apartheid.""
Her colleague Omar has a history of anti-Israel statements that have been so offensive and so anti-Semitic that even House Democrats including Nancy Pelosi had to rebuke her.
Their fellow ""Squad"" member A.O.C. has said supporting Israel means taking ""the side of occupation."" 
Their friend Congresswoman Jayapal has copy-pasted Hamas propaganda to call Israel ""racist.""
And this past week Congresswoman Tlaib went full-on victim-blaming. She said Israel is ""apartheid"" and responsible for the cycle of violence. As we speak, she continues to fly the Palestinian flag in the taxpayer-funded hallway outside her office.
These people support the anti-Semitic B.D.S. Movement that calls for economic warfare against Israel through boycotts and sanctions — simply because the Jewish state dares to exist.
And several of them put those bigoted boycotts into practice themselves a few months back. They boycotted President Herzog's speech to Congress and voted against a pro-Israel resolution.
I said at the time that giving aid and comfort to anti-Semitism was a dangerous, reckless signal for members of Congress to send. But even before Israel has buried its dead, even with hostages still in captivity, they began doubling and tripling down.
More toxic rhetoric. More victim-blaming. More fake moral equivalence between good and evil.
President Biden and other progressives pretend they're different. They pretend they're respectable. Moderate. Grown-ups.
But their top priority is their own power.
Neither Hakeem Jefferies nor Chuck Schumer nor Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris have said a single word this past week to repudiate the insane, reckless reactions to the attacks from their own side.
We've seen D.S.A. socialists and far-left activists groups pour into the streets of New York and Chicago to praise the terrorists and insult Israel. Mass demonstrations — taking the terrorists' side!
And radical student groups at our elite universities are putting out despicable statements taking the side of the killers.
We are talking about Americans celebrating terrorism. Celebrating the killings and the kidnappings. Calling for the eradication of Israel ""from the river to the sea.""
These are the same groups that put the ""Squad"" in Congress. The same people who decide Democrat primary elections.
Several of the Representatives I just named are members of the D.S.A. themselves.
Where are the repudiations? Where are the primary challengers?
Why will neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris say a word about any of this?
Because it's about power. And they'll do anything to hang onto it. 
They will weaponize race and class here at home. They will tell hope-stealing lies about systemic racism. They call America an evil country. And they give aid and comfort to extremists who are not just anti-Israel, but anti-Semitic.
Radical liberals are choosing their own political power over peace.
They would rather invite attacks on our allies than stand up to the fringe in their own party.
It is cowardice that makes them complicit. And it has to stop. 
We need to eliminate the racist, socialist, anti-Semitic D.S.A. from American politics.
If the D.S.A. and their friends are going to behave like a hate group, we should treat them like one. And we should stop pretending it's normal or OK that the most famous, most prominent House Democrats in the country are joined at the hip with them.
Every member of the Squad should either quit the D.S.A. and repudiate the people who are cheering on deadly terrorism… or they must be expelled from Congress.
***
We need a policy of strength and leadership.
Number one — We need to rescue the American hostages and get them out. Period.
We need to bring those Americans home this instant. Use our Special Forces if we have to.
And the President needs to stop hosting White House picnics and 'calling a lid' at lunchtime until our fellow citizens are safe.
We need a Commander-in-Chief who will put the world on notice with a policy that is very simple: If you take an American life, it will cost you yours.  We'll make sure of it.
Number two — Hamas needs to be wiped off the face of the earth. Decades of America's investment have helped Israel possess the hardware and the capabilities they need to do it.
But as we are already seeing, this new war is going to be a burden and a struggle, even for an ally as well prepared as this one. Israel is going to need more help. More coordination. More ammo.
And when I'm in the Oval Office, if Israel finds itself in need of anything, one phone call to my White House is all it will take.
When America's allies need to reload, the arsenal of democracy has to be stocked and ready.
When I'm president, we will never send out pathetic and weak statements trying to stop our allies from responding when they're attacked. 
My Secretary of State will not publicly call for a premature ceasefire and then have to delete the tweet. 
The only words out of President Biden's mouth should be: ""How can we help?"" 
And more broadly — America needs to bring back a Middle East policy that treats our allies like allies… and our enemies like enemies. 
No more desperate cuddling up to Iran.
No more planeloads of cash to terrorist sponsors.
No more condescending lectures and hostile gestures to our strongest ally in the region and the only democracy in the Middle East.
As the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, I have legislation to strengthen and extend our Iran sanctions. When I'm President, I'll sign it into law.
And earlier today, I called upon Secretary Janet Yellen to come to Congress and testify on the $6 billion slush fund. They need to explain to us and to the country what they could have possibly been thinking.
We also need to shut off the funding that Joe Biden restarted to the UN's irredeemably flawed Palestinian aid programs. The best investment we can make in peace and stability is backing Israel 100%. 
We need to strengthen our intelligence-sharing partnerships so a surprise like this never happens again.
We need to restart the momentum of the Abraham Accords and continue to help Israel gain respect and recognition throughout the Arab world.
And we need to safeguard our own national security and our own homeland. That starts with securing our wide-open border. 
Scores of people on the terrorist watch list have tried to cross our porous southern border. People from Syria, Iran, Yemen, and Pakistan have been found breaking into our nation. And those are just the ones we've caught.
We need to regain the high ground with a president who is strong.
Not a president who's asleep at the wheel. 
Not a president who will tolerate extremists and anti-Semites to protect his own power.
Israel is not too much for the Jewish people to ask.
Speaking as a Christian, our elder brothers and sisters in faith have suffered enough.
The history of European anti-Semitism. Then the Holocaust. Now 75 years of hatred, rocket fire, and terrorism.
Geographically, Israel is a small fingernail in a massive stretch of majority-Muslim countries, almost 5,000 miles, from the Atlantic coast of Africa to India's border with Pakistan.
The people of Israel are not asking too much! They have made generous offer after generous offer that the Palestinian leaders have rejected.
They simply want to live in peace. It's a human right. And it's non-negotiable. 
***
Let me conclude with this.
I will always condemn anti-Semitism, appeasement, and weakness on the radical left.
But I will also call out weakness or confusion among conservatives as well.
Hear me clearly, it's not an equal problem. But it's a problem. 
Vivek Ramaswamy has said the definition of success is reducing America's support for Israel. And he's proposed that we surrender Taiwan to the Chinese Communist Party as long as we've relocated some factories.
Governor DeSantis once dismissed Russia's invasion of Ukraine as just some ""territorial dispute.""
The last thing we need is a Joe Biden wing of the Republican Party on foreign policy.
It's also a mistake and damaging when some Republicans keep repeating that America is in decline.
They paint a picture of some failing empire that needs to cut our losses and pull up the drawbridge. 
That idea is dead wrong. And it's dangerous.
The American people are not in decline. American courage and American values aren't in decline. 
We're just stuck with a weak President who is in retreat.
Joe Biden has America retreating from safety on our streets and security at our borders.
He has us retreating from stable prices and supply chains…
Retreating from the very core values that have made America exceptional…
And retreating from peace through American strength abroad.
We aren't in decline. We're in a Biden retreat. So all we need to do is turn around.
I am running for President to restore peace through strength.
To double down on American power.
We need a Commander-in-Chief who is loyal to our allies and lethal to our adversaries, with resolve that is beyond any question.
And when I am President, there will not be one terrorist or anti-Semite on the face of the Earth who doubts for one second that America has Israel's back. 
So allow me to close with the prayer of the Prophet Isaiah for Jerusalem, in Isaiah 62: 
""Because I love Zion, I will not keep still. Because my heart yearns for Jerusalem, I cannot remain silent.
""I will not stop praying for her until her righteousness shines like the dawn, and her salvation blazes like a burning torch…
May the Lord ""hold you in his hand for all to see – a splendid crown in the hand of God.""
May God's mercy comfort Israel today…
May God's justice protect Israel tomorrow…
And may God bless the United States of America.
Thank you.

""Overall, the important thing for our country to be doing is standing with Israel."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Good Morning New Hampshire with Jack Heath and WFEA'S The Morning Update with Drew Cline. The highlights are below.
Watch part one of the Drew Cline interview HERE and part two HERE.
On eradicating Hamas:
I think the main thing is just moral clarity that Israel has a right to defend itself to the hilt, and that means eradicate Hamas, their networks, their infrastructure. No wishy washy-ness, no on one hand or the other. What those Hamas terrorists were doing was probably the most barbaric things that I've ever seen. And it's very, very difficult to watch. Anyone that's seen some of those videos, it's just absolutely revolting. So I think that's the main thing is just stand firm with them. Because what's going to happen is, as the days and weeks go on, to the United Nations, all these other countries, they are going to start probably blaming Israel. And we just need to say, no, we're going to stand with them. They've got a great military. They have all hands on deck. I think they're going to be able to do what they need to do to protect them. But my fear is, you know, you had the State Department put out something that they had to take down, calling for no further violence. Blinken had to take down a tweet where he was saying there should be a ceasefire. That is going to be very dangerous because then that puts Israel in a more difficult situation.
On Biden's funding of Iran:
Oh, he's got responsibility. They made a deliberate decision when he came into office to loosen the screws on Iran, to allow them to get more money flowing in their coffers for oil sales. I would have had those sanctions to the hilt to deny them that type of money. Of course, we now have this $6 billion which was a terrible deal to do, it sent a very bad signal. The media saying, 'Well, that money can't be used for terrorism,' but obviously, money is fungible, so that freed up the resources to be able to do. What is Iran doing with the money that they get? They don't do it to make the Iranian people's lives better. They send it to their terrorist proxies, like Hamas and Hezbollah. So that was something that was obvious. And even Blinken, and even people in Biden's administration a couple years ago, acknowledged that money that goes to Iran or to the Gaza Strip ends up being used for terrorism. So they knew what they were doing. They had a delusional belief that somehow you can have a rapprochement with the Mullahs in Iran. Look, they hate Israel, they hate the United States. This is a deep-seeded belief. It's ideological, it's part of their religious faith, and they're going to continue to do this. So that should have been something that was obvious. So yes, they do bear responsibility. And then just his response to this overall, this is a guy that's missing in action. He's not out there leading. We have Americans that have been killed. We know at least 11. We don't know, or he's not telling us, whether any Americans are being held hostage. We do know there's Americans that are missing. Where was he all day yesterday? They call the lid at 11:50 in the morning. He didn't come out and address any of these issues. They issued a press release. You can't govern by press release. You were elected to lead, you got to stand up and deliver, and he's just failed to do that. So look, I didn't expect anything more than this. This is a guy that's clearly past his prime and is just not up to the job.
On the importance of securing the border:
I think what's happened in Israel should show us that our border is a massive vulnerability. I mean, do you not think that our enemies have exploited that over the last two and a half years, knowing they can move people through? We know that people from Iran and Russia, other places in the Middle East, China have come across the border. I mean, we know that. We know people on the terror watch list have come across the border. So, it's a massive vulnerability. Now the cartels are really the movers and shakers of what's going on with the mass migration, they're helping to facilitate sex trafficking and human trafficking, and as of course, as communities all across America know, the fentanyl that they're bringing across has sparked a massive epidemic all over this country. And they have blood on their hands. [We need to] treat them as foreign terrorist organizations. When they are trying to break into our country, particularly when they're moving the product, we're going to use lethal force against them. We have every right to do it... they're killing our people. As Commander in Chief, you not only have the right, I think you have the duty to defend your people. And if you do that, and that becomes the way it goes, they're going to change their behavior very quickly. They do what they do because they're allowed to get away with murder, and nobody's pushed back on them. And it's not just going to be at the border. We're going to have naval assets involved in intercepting some of the precursor chemicals that are coming into Mexico that the cartels then use to create the fentanyl. This is something that's costing a lot of American lives, and it's about time we did something about it.
Watch the full interview on Good Morning New Hampshire with Jack Heath HERE.
On Joe Biden missing in action:
President Biden's been missing in action. I mean, he's not showing leadership, they didn't even wake him up when this was, when this broke out- would have been one or two in the morning Washington time. He was nowhere to be found. Yesterday, they called a lid even though 11 Americans at least have been killed by Hamas, and those attacks, we know that they're more missing. The administration hasn't told us whether there's any being held hostage, the State Department had to take down two different tweets in the first 48 hours basically urging Israel to show restraint and even calling for a ceasefire. So, I think the performance has been really, really poor. And it's just sad that we don't have leadership when we need it. Now, overall, the important thing for our country to be doing is standing with Israel. They're a strong ally of ours. And that means they need to be able to go and defend themselves, uproot and destroy the entire Hamas terror networks. What ends up happening in these things is Hamas or Hezbollah, one of these groups will commit some barbaric attacks, although this one does take the cake. There's no question. Israel responds, then like, you know, a week later, people start blaming Israel, and then the UN starts rattling and all this stuff. That will happen, the media is going to start turning it on Israel. I think some of these other countries are going to start doing that. And it's important for the United States to say no, there's no moral equivalence here. What happened to Israel should not happen to anybody. There were more Jews killed that day, then at any time since the Holocaust. So, they have to be able to do this and put this issue to bed once and for all. And if we can just do that, I think that that'll give them the breathing room that they need to be able to defend their people.
On his upcoming trip to New Hampshire:
We've laid the groundwork, and that's what we did over the summer and then now that we're in the fall, we're going to be in New Hampshire a lot. So, I think you're going to see a lot of activity for us. You want to peek in New Hampshire, at the end of the year, the beginning of next year, you don't want to peek in the summer before. This stuff goes up and down. New Hampshire primaries are very volatile, as you know, so we have the groundwork in place. Now you're going to start seeing us. We're going to be up in the town halls, we're going to be doing all that because we know how important it is. So, we're in good shape. I think that there's a lot of real estate to go and we're the only one that's really, you know, challenging Donald Trump in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Some are focusing on one, some are focusing on others, we're going to do both to the hilt because we know both are really important.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined the Howie Carr Show on New England's WKRO-AM 680. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On the need to support Israel and secure the US border:
I think just given what's happened in Israel, I was down in Miami in the Surfside area, and we did an announcement on the state of Florida. We're going to expand sanctions against Iran because basically, if any money that goes to that regime, they're not using it to help the people of Iran. They're helping it to fund terrorism. But we have a strong Jewish population, particularly in South Florida, and it's raw what's happened over there. They know people missing. They know people, unfortunately, that have died. So I was down there this morning, and it kind of puts it in perspective--there's a lot of problems with our country, there's a lot of problems in the world, and we need to focus on -- all the clutter that gets out there -- let's focus on what really matters. I get worried. I mean, I've been railing against our border and all the problems there for a number of reasons. The fentanyl overdose, the sex trafficking, just the sheer number of people that are overwhelming communities. But do you think that our enemies have not been taking advantage of that open border? We know Chinese have come across, we know Iranians have come across, we know Russians have come across, and we know other people from the Middle East come across. And I said, long before this attack on Israel, that there would be a terrorist attack in our country that could be traced back to the southern border. And I think I'm right on that. I hope I'm not, but I'd bet a lot of money I am.
On the leftist ideology that has infiltrated college campuses:
I knew it was always very left wing, and certainly when I was there, it was, and I was one of the few that came out there more conservative than when I went in, which is not easy to do. But at this point with the Ivy League, how nuts they've gotten, if I see a Harvard resume cross my desk, I'm running the other way. I mean, what is going on there is absolutely appalling. Yes, they've always been anti-Israel, but to go up in cheer a terrorist group that's cutting off the heads of infants. It's absolutely despicable.
On building the border wall:
Could the elites make it any clearer that they think that hard-working American citizens should come last? I mean, you're talking about people that are serving on active duty or veterans. These are folks that we should be honoring, and instead, they're being put to the back of the bus for people that came into this country illegally, and are being housed -- I mean, some of these folks are being put up in great accommodations. You know, there's veterans who end up homeless who don't end up getting this in different parts of the city. There's American citizens, just generally, who are not treated this well. We really have our priorities out of whack. But you know, the left in this country, with as bad as this border crisis has been, and obviously I wish it didn't happen, they've now had to eat some of this because they were the ones that have supported these types of policies. And now all of a sudden, you have the mayor of New York, the governor of New York, governor of Massachusetts acknowledging like this is just totally ridiculous. The Illinois Governor even said you can't have an open border, and yet Biden still does nothing. They claim he's finally going to start building the wall, but I'll believe that when I see it. I think that was a head fake.
On why he is the best candidate for president:
I will clean out FBI and DOJ. You know, Trump said the jury's still out on Christopher Wray as FBI director. I can tell you, with me, it's not. You are going to see a change on day one, and we are going to hold these people accountable. And we're going to end weaponization of the Justice Department. So I will do that. I think I'm in a better position to do it. I think it'd be harder for him to do it for a number of ways. So take that to the bank. I agree, I think the federal justice system is totally out of control. I have credibility on this because I've removed two Soros-backed prosecutors -- one in Tampa, one in Orlando... I also am able to serve two terms, and Donald Trump would not be able to do that. You know, I've said I think his path to 270 electoral votes is tough, and I think I have a clearer path for that. But put that aside, I think you need to serve two consecutive terms to get all this stuff to stick. Because you're talking about getting this bureaucracy back under the Constitution, slaying the administrative state; man, that's trench warfare. You're going to have to have thousands of people in there supporting you as appointees, and you're going to have to go to work. These people are not going to give up their power willingly. You got to know how to use the levers of power. You got to have strategic judgment, discipline and focus. And you've really got to do it for two full terms, and I'll be able to do that for people.

On the importance of standing with Israel:
I'm down in Bal Harbour. We just did an event at the Shul here, and it's raw for our community down in South Florida. We have the second biggest Israeli-American community in the country. We have a large Jewish population that's really expanded a lot in the last few years, particularly with the Orthodox Jews. So everybody knows somebody who's been over there. People know people that are missing, and unfortunately, people know people that had been killed. This is perhaps Israel's darkest hour. This is a country that had to fight for its inception in the late 1940s. The Arab armies wanted to extinguish it in the crib. Then they were going to get invaded in '67, and they preempted that in the Six-Day War. Then they did get invaded with the Yom Kippur War, and they were able to win that. And then they faced Intifada after Intifada. And then this, the level of barbarity, it's hard to comprehend. The images and the videos are absolutely disgusting. And I just think it's important as Americans that we all come together -- Israel has a right to defend itself, and that means do that to the hilt. You have to uproot the terrorist infrastructure, these networks, and Hamas needs to be no more. I fear, what happens in these situations is you have people say Israel can respond, then a week later, then two weeks later, then people start to blame Israel. There's no moral equivalence between a Hamas terrorists and an Israeli civilian. And they have every right to see this through to the hilt.
On how the election needs to be a referendum on Joe Biden's failures:
I think a referendum on Joe Biden means we win if I'm the candidate. I think a referendum on Donald Trump, if that's it, then I think the Democrats would win. Joe, there are millions of voters out there who don't like what Biden's doing, think that the country's going in the wrong direction. They want to vote for a Republican. But once it's Donald Trump, that's just a deal breaker for them. They just won't do it. I saw a report I think on your network where someone said he was a Republican, he said it didn't matter. He would do Biden. That's just the reality that Republicans have to face up to if we want to win, and we saw these losses in the most recent elections. 2220 2018. Let's give them a fresh America chance for a fresh start. And I think that the results will be very positive for us.
On his military service:
In terms of Iran, look, this is personal for me in the sense of I served in Iraq back in 2007, 2008. We were in places like Volusia and Ramadi. Mostly Sunni Arab al Qaeda fighters at the time, but most of the casualties US troops were suffering were at the hands of Iranian-backed Shia militias. They killed hundreds of our troops in Iraq, probably over 1000. Of course, they were responsible, through Hezbollah, for killing our Marines back in 1983 in the Beirut barracks bombing. So Iran has a lot of American blood on its hands. Look, I think that Israel should be focused on uprooting Hamas. To make this a larger role, I think, does have some risks, but I would say the United States should turn every screw so that Iran is not getting money flowing into its coffers, particularly with their oil.
On cracking down on Iran:
I've always supported, from the time I was a congressman to now, the strongest possible turning of the screws on Iran and their energy. My view is anything that goes to that regime, they are not trying to make life better for the Iranian people. They are going to use that, and they are going to try to fund terrorism with it. And I think that that's a lesson, but I will also say this, Donald Trump's approach to Iran was stronger than his predecessor's was, and it's been stronger than the Biden was. I think both Obama and Biden thought you could have a reproachment with them. I don't think that that's possible.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott On The Ingraham Angle: Biden's Failed Policies Endanger American Lives,2023-10-10T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-the-ingraham-angle-bidens-failed-policies-endanger,"
WASHINGTON, DC – Tim Scott joined FOX News tonight on The Ingraham Angle to blast the threats at home and abroad enabled by Joe Biden and the radical Left's failed foreign policy.
The interview follows Tim's Israel speech today at the Hudson Institute, where he made ""scathing critiques"" of Biden, the Squad, and dangerous Republican foreign policy.
WATCH HERE
Laura Ingraham: What do you make of the Administration's continued efforts to kind of downplay what Iran has done with Hamas?
Sen Scott: It makes them complicit. You think about the fact that his weakness invited the attacks without any question. His negotiations of $6 billion he gave to Iran helped to fund the attacks. And his first statement out of the Administration was telling them to refrain from responding. That is insanity. But it also makes Biden complicit with the attacks. I can't say it more clearly. I am very concerned that this is actually a mass plan on the radical Left, when you think about our southern border wide open, insecure, and unsafe, you think about the funding that they send over to Iran. You put all that together. What do you see? You see the Squad out there with their antisemitism. You see all the strategies coming together for one purpose. The purpose is power. There is something sinister of nature in the midst of all of this.

CHARLESTON, SC – Today, Tim Scott joined CNN's The Situation Room to discuss the Biden Administration's complicity in the evil attacks on Israel committed by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists.
WATCH HERE
Wolf Blitzer: What's your reaction to these awful images, these heartbreaking stories coming out of Israel as this war against Hamas terrorists moves into now its fourth day?
Tim Scott: Well, Wolf, it is just devastating to see the images and watch the videos. You see the one video of the young lady having her throat cut and then you see her head dragging along the way on the road. That kind of devastation, that kind of — evil is the only word for it — that kind of evil should have a swift, clear, complete reaction to it. And we should be supporting Israel. Making sure there's no daylight between America and Israel is absolutely essential. And it's time for the President to come back and speak to the nation. It's been two days nearly without hearing from the President. And I'll say without question, I find him to be complicit in this actual war against Israel....
I think we should be without question totally and completely united behind Israel. Period. We should look back at the breadcrumbs that lead back to the hostage negotiation that freed $6 billion. And what did Tehran say about the $6 billion? We will use it in any way we like. What did Hamas say to Iran? They said, ""thank you."" What if we discovered that the negotiation and the planning of this attack was Iran working with Hamas? That is clear cookie crumbs, breadcrumbs, evidence. From my perspective, that doesn't suggest, it reinforces the fact that Iran is behind these attacks. Allowing $6 billion, increasing the price on an American life and creating a market for hostage taking. It's just devastating Wolf.

Statement by Will Hurd Announcing the End of Presidential Campaign Activities and Endorsing Nikki Haley for President,2023-10-09T00:00:00+00:00,Will Hurd,/documents/statement-will-hurd-announcing-the-end-presidential-campaign-activities-and-endorsing,"
When I first entered the Republican presidential primary field in June, I knew I was a dark horse candidate with a path to victory that would contain many obstacles. But as I traveled across the country, I met so many Americans who believed in my campaign's message of unity and common sense.
In 14 short weeks, my team and I matched the accomplishments of many of the other candidates in the race who had significantly higher name ID and cash advantage. I am honored to have had the support of the people who made this possible.
Unfortunately, it has become clear to me and my team that the time has come to suspend our campaign. While I appreciate all the time and energy our supporters have given, it is important to recognize the realities of the political landscape and the need to consolidate our party around one person to defeat both Donald Trump and President Biden. I urge donors, voters, and other candidates to unite around an alternative candidate to Trump. Otherwise, we will repeat the same errors as in 2016. If the Republican party nominates Donald Trump or the various personalities jockeying to imitate his divisive, crass behavior, we will lose.
I entered this race for a few simple reasons. First, to do what I can to ensure this experiment called America lasts for another 247 years. Second, Americans deserve better than the rematch from hell between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Third, not enough people are talking about real, achievable solutions to the generation-defining challenges that are in front of us, including artificial intelligence, our new Cold War with China, and the complexity of the ongoing crisis at our southern border.
Our nation deserves a leader who can unite us and navigate the complex challenges we face, particularly when it comes to our national security. I believe Ambassador Nikki Haley is the best person in this race to do that. Ambassador Haley has shown a willingness to articulate a different vision for the country than Donald Trump and has an unmatched grasp on the complexities of our foreign policy. I wholeheartedly endorse Ambassador Haley and look forward to supporting her for the remainder of this race.

Statement by Ron DeSantis on Americans Killed in Israel,2023-10-09T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/statement-ron-desantis-americans-killed-israel,"
""We must not only stand with Israel, but we must support them as they hunt down and eradicate these barbarians."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today released a statement following reports that nine Americans have been killed in the Hamas terrorist attacks. DeSantis also called for three immediate steps the United States should take in response.
""One of our greatest allies, Israel, has been attacked by terrorists funded by Iran– with over 800 Israelis murdered and 2,000 injured. The scenes of brutality are hard to watch. Innocent men, women, children, and the elderly.
And we learned this morning that among these victims are at least nine American citizens killed and others likely missing or taken hostage.
Hamas committed these acts for two simple reasons: they hate the Jewish people, and they are evil cowards. They were empowered by Joe Biden's appeasement of Iran and a desire to ruin further normalization of ties within the Arab world with Israel.
We must not only stand with Israel, but we must support them as they hunt down and eradicate these barbarians.
Israel, with the full support of the United States, should kill Hamas members and extinguish their entire infrastructure.
And right now, America must immediately do three things: (i) freeze any money Joe Biden has made available to Iran; (ii) cut off any and all types of foreign aid flowing to Hamas; and (iii) immediately shut down America's wide-open southern border to ensure we are in a position to better protect Americans here at home from these real threats.
These are incredibly dangerous times – but I have confidence that both the Israeli and American spirit can and will prevail over evil.""

Sen Scott: Let's just put this in context. Number one, 1,100 deaths in Israel is like 40,000 in America. Number two, this was an act of pure evil. I hope that Hamas is wiped off the face of the Earth. What I would do as Commander in Chief is make sure that Israel has all the assets and the support they need, number one. Number two, I would have constant conversations with Netanyahu to make sure that he knows that there is no daylight between our country and Israel. Number three, we've seen the Biden Administration cuddling up with Iran and distancing themselves from Israel. We saw that when Biden passed up an opportunity to meet with Israel.
I said yesterday that we should move the Sixth Fleet into the Mediterranean to have more support there. I'm glad to see that happening. I would also say that we need to make sure that our intelligence is working very closely with Israeli intelligence. And finally, humanitarian support, making sure that we are logistically in a position to be as effective as possible, especially now that we know there are American hostages. We, the United States of America, must regain the high ground by having a president who is strong, not one who is asleep at the wheel. And that's why I'm running.

Watch the full interview HERE.
On the importance of standing with Israel:
The first thing is to be very clear that not only do they have a right to defend themselves, but they have a right to use overwhelming force. Part of the reason we're in this situation is because in past iterations of attacks, which admittedly, were not at this level, Israel would respond, but then there'd immediately be a lot of pressure for Israel to stand down. Israel would even start getting blamed. And so they never really uprooted the terror networks of Hamas, and even Hezbollah, like they probably should have. So this is a time where this is their 9/11 -- probably times four or five from what we're seeing with the horrific images and the casualty count for such a small country. It's an unbelievable terrorist attack that I think they need to uproot all of those networks. Now, there's going to start to be moral equivalence put out there. There's going to start to be condemnations from the United Nations. I'm not saying it's going to happen tomorrow, but I could definitely see in the not-too-distant future that. So we just need to be united as Americans that they have a right to do what they need to do. And if we just do that, I think that that will be most of it because they take pride in their own defense. I've been a big supporter of providing support for Israel, which we do every year -- not huge amounts of money, you know, a couple, a few billion, but that's in addition to what Israel is doing for themselves. They've never asked us to displace their responsibility to defend their country. And I think it'll be similar here. Of course, we're going to maintain the support and the security arrangement that we have. We also are going to have to get all the facts about it, but it seems like that there have been Americans killed -- I don't know if that's been confirmed by the White House yet -- and taken hostage. And that implicates our national security in a big, big way. We cannot have terrorists going after our citizens anywhere around this world, and so will have a responsibility, perhaps, for rescue if they're still alive, but that does implicate our national interest in a very strong way.
On standing up to Iran:
I think that this should cause Biden to short circuit any type of talks, to reimpose the strongest sanctions across the board, including on their energy industry. Ultimately, if you starve them of cash, they're going to be limited in what they're going to be able to do around the world. I do think that if you go over to Israel -- I mean, I know you've been there -- if you talk to people like Prime Minister Netanyahu, if you ask them, what are your top three issues you've got to deal with? He would say number one is Iran, number two is Iran, and number three is Iran. So, I think they're very mindful -- like, Hamas was just the tool and the instrument, but ultimately, this was an attack by the Iranians. And if the Iranians could push a button and wipe Israel off the map, they would do that. That's what they want to do. They're very honest about that. So US policy under both Biden and Obama, they just had rose-colored glasses with respect to Iran. I think there was ideology involved. Let's just cut that now, turn the screws on them, and that'll benefit the United States, it'll benefit Israel, and it'll benefit our allies throughout the world.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Hits Five More Counties on Second Day of Three-day Swing in Iowa,2023-10-08T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-hits-five-more-counties-second-day-three-day,"
Tallahassee, FL - The DeSantis family had an action-packed Sunday, hitting five new Iowa counties (reaching 67 out of 99) on the mission to complete the 'Full Grassley.' Today is the second day of DeSantis' three-day bus tour as a special guest with Never Back Down.
DeSantis started off the morning by stopping at a Hy-Vee grocery store in Henry County to have a cup of coffee with Iowans before heading to church.
Then, he and the family attended a church service at Marion Avenue Baptist Church in Washington County. DeSantis addressed the congregation:
""Our rights do not come from the government, they come from the Lord our God. And that begins with the right to life itself,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""And when some people say that signing legislation to protect the right to life — like we did in Florida with the heartbeat bill, like your governor in Iowa did with the heartbeat bill — anyone who tells you that that's somehow a 'terrible thing' is not standing for the right to life.""
DeSantis then held a completely packed meet-and-greet at Refuge City Church in Cedar Rapids.
""It's important that we as Americans say to terrorists all around the world: you do not harm one hair on the head of an American citizen, or else you will have hell to pay,"" he said.
DeSantis was asked by a reporter for his response to potential Americans harmed in the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. DeSantis replied,
""I haven't seen anything confirmed, but clearly, anybody that knows Israel knows that there are a lot of Americans that live there, that study there...the State Department, the Administration, they need to identify if there are any Americans that have been harmed, if there are any Americans that are being held hostage. That's something that's very important. And of course, we owe a responsibility to be able to defend our people.""
He hit county #66 with a stop at The Crow Bar in Buchanan County.
Then, the family enjoyed some time at the Zumbach Family Farm in Delaware County. Senator Zumbach is the longtime chair of the Iowa Senate Agriculture Committee and has endorsed Gov. DeSantis ahead of the caucus.
DeSantis closed out the evening at a fundraiser with Iowa State Senator Dan Zumbach, reaching county #67.
During the day, DeSantis' interview with Iowa's KTVO aired, where he said, ""The reason why Iran got that money was because the Biden administration relief sanctions, they had oil money flowing in that they shouldn't have had."" Watch the full segment HERE.
DeSantis' interviews with Fox News and Newsmax also aired today. Watch the Fox News segment HERE and the Newsmax segment HERE.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron and Casey DeSantis joined Shannon Bream for a sit-down interview that aired on Fox News Sunday today. The highlights are below.
Watch part one HERE, part two HERE, and part three HERE.
On the contrast between his leadership in Florida and the chaos in D.C.:
At the end of the day, you got to be focused on results. And what I've seen up there in Washington for both parties is a lot of theater. There's a lot of things that are done, it's performative, but it's not ultimately leading to anything. And the contrast between what's going on there and say with Florida is, I'm not running a soap opera down here, I'm not an entertainer, my job is to be the leader, to be able to lay out a vision, execute that vision and deliver results. And so as President, I'll provide the leadership. We know that we're going to need to go to tackle the budget, tackle the border wall in the southern border, all these key issues. But we're going to be judged by what we deliver for the American people, you know, the people that are struggling to buy groceries, the people that can't afford a mortgage or can't afford a new car. They don't really care who the speaker of the House is, they just want to see the job get done. We've got to not focus so much on what's happening inside DC and focus on what's happening throughout the rest of the country.
On how he will get things done in Washington:
My first four years, we earned veto proof majorities by winning the biggest reelection victory that a Republican governor has ever had in the history of the state of Florida. We delivered results, the people responded, and we took Florida from being a very competitive state politically, a one-point state, to now making it one of the strongest Republican states. And of course, we're leading on the policy. So we earned the opportunity to do that. The first four years, we didn't necessarily have that. So how is it done? It's not about me, it's not about personalities of the legislative leadership, it's a bottom-up approach. Your vision resonates with the people and then the people tell the representatives, 'get in line.' President Reagan did not have a Republican House at all when he came in. And what did he do? He went over the heads of the people, of the legislators, spoke directly to the people and people said you know what, this country is going in the wrong direction, work with the President and let's turn things around. The majority of the public knows this country is in a state of decline. And so we need to reverse the decline. We need to usher in an American revival. What we did in Florida is a model that can work for the country.
On following through with campaign promises:
The average person, they get engaged in this as it gets a lot closer to the caucuses and to the primaries. So I think you'll see that, but now for example, on right to life he said that pro-life protections like in Iowa and Florida, he said it's a terrible thing. And so I think a lot of people were shocked when he said that. Then he was saying in Iowa the other day about building the wall and having Mexico pay for it, probably the most famous political promise this century, certainly one of in American history. And he said, 'Well, there was never a mechanism for me to have Mexico pay for the wall.' He acted like it was never possible to begin with. That was a core promise. The thing is, you actually could have had Mexico pay for it, not just tell them the pay. Of course not. You impose fees on the remittances that people who are working in America are sending back to Mexico and other countries, it would generate billions of dollars, you'd be able to build a wall. So what I've told people is, I'm the only guy running that I've made good on 100% of my promises. I will do the same as president and I will even make good on Donald Trump's promises from 2016 that he wasn't able to do_.
First Lady Casey DeSantis on campaigning as a family:
This time goes by so fast, right? It's like, what do they say, the years are short, the days are long, and it just goes by in the blink of an eye. And so, even before this interview today, I was out doing a field trip with our six-year-old and came in here and got ready and tried to come because, you know -- and that's why you see them on the campaign trail with us because we don't want to miss these opportunities.
On why he emphasizes the economy and culture fights:
I think if people fairly look at what I've done as governor, and then what I talk about on the campaign trail, the number one thing I talked about is, people are paying too much for everything, people are falling behind, the American Dream has slipped away. In Florida, we're one of the few states where we've had a big increase in personal income. We have no income tax, of course, we have a big budget surplus. Since I've been governor, we've paid down almost 25% of our state's total debt, while cutting taxes, and being the number one state for new business formations. And so we have a record second to none on all those issues. I do think though, some of these cultural issues affect things far beyond whatever-- for example, we had the fight about the gender ideology in the elementary schools. We can't as a country succeed if kindergarteners are being taught that their gender's a choice, or that they can change, they were born in the wrong body. That's just wrong. And so yes, I'm the father of a six, five, and a three-year-old, my wife and I are sensitive about what's going on in the schools. But I also think this society needs to be rooted in truth. And so many of these fights are based on things that are just not true. And we have a responsibility to fight back. The truth will set you free.
On winning in Iowa and the early voting states:
What they're saying is just not true. We're going to win Iowa. We think that that's very important. We are going to be in New Hampshire a lot more. I think we've got plans to do that, and you'll see all that stuff is very volatile in those early states. We're going to have four weeks in South Carolina after New Hampshire between that, so we're going to get the job done. But it does start with Iowa. That's where we're going to make the mark. But we're going to be all-in on all those states. And you know, all those guys, all the chatter that they do, they've been wrong for years. People were chattering about my reelection as governor, saying we weren't running a good campaign, that we were sputtering, and I won the biggest victory that we've ever seen in the state of Florida for a Republican.

CHARLESTON, SC — Today, Tim Scott released the following statement on Hamas' deadly attack on Israel:
""Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel today is an assault on Western Civilization.
""The truth is though, Joe Biden funded these attacks on Israel.
""America's weakness is blood in the water for bad actors, but this is worse than that. We didn't just invite this aggression, we paid for it. Iran is the biggest funder of Hamas. This is the Biden $6 billion ransom payment at work.
""Israel must defend its people and the nation, and the United States must do everything we can to assist our ally Israel.
""As Psalm 122:6 encourages us, we must pray for the peace of Jerusalem.""

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis this morning released a video statement in response to the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel.
""Israel is now under attack. I stand with Israel. America stands with Israel. Not only they have a right to defend themselves, they have a duty to defend themselves against these Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists. Iran has helped fund this war against Israel, and Joe Biden's policies that have gone easy on Iran has helped to fill their coffers. Israel is now paying the price for those policies. We're going to stand with the State of Israel, they need to root out Hamas and we need to stand up to Iran.""

DeSantis visits five new counties in Iowa on day one of a three-day swing 
Tallahassee, FL - The DeSantis family is back in Iowa for a three-day swing. DeSantis today hit five new counties as a special guest with Never Back Down on his continued quest to visit all of the state's 99 counties.
He started off the day with a packed meet and greet in at Smokey Row Coffee in Ankeny. The event was over capacity and the parking lot outside was filled with another 100+.
""As Americans this morning, we all stand with the state of Israel,"" DeSantis said at the meet and greet.
Fox News reported on DeSantis' comments in a gaggle with reporters in an article titled ""DeSantis Blasts Biden for 'sleeping on the job,' starting calls hours after Israel terror attacks began."" Read the full article HERE.
He stopped to talk to the overflow crowd outside.
""We have it within our power to reverse this nation's decline. We have an opportunity to usher in a Great American Revival and get this country a new birth of freedom and that is exactly why I'm running for president,"" DeSantis told the overflow crowd.
Then, Ron DeSantis, along with First Lady Casey DeSantis, Madison, Mason, and Mamie, went to Oktoberfest Ottumwa in Wapello County (county 59 of 99) for some family fun.
Afterwards, he hit county #60 at M3 Fabrication & Powder Coating in Davis County.
DeSantis then held a meet and greet in Keosauqua in Van Buren County.
For dinner, DeSantis hit County #62 by visiting the Fort Diner in Lee County, and for his last stop of the evening paid a visit to State Senator Jeff Reichman's fundraiser, checking off County #64 in the process.
During the day, DeSantis joined Newsmax for a phone interview to talk about the terrorist attacks in Israel.
""Our strongest ally in the Middle East is under attack and he's just sleeping through the night? We need a president that's going to be able to respond to those 3AM phone calls and show some leadership.""
DeSantis was also interviewed by Ottumwa Radio, where he was asked what makes him stand out among other Republican presidential candidates:
""One, I'm the only veteran running for President. I'd be the first president elected since 1988 that's served our country in a war overseas. Second, I'm a dad of a six-, five-, and three-year-old, so all these issues with education, parents' rights, that's very personal to me. And as President, I think it'd be good to have a family, young family in the White House again. And then I'm the only guy running who, everything I've promised the voters I would do as governor of Florida, I delivered on 100% of my promises. We did more America First policy in Florida than anybody running for president. And as President United States, you can trust me to follow through and deliver on the promises. And it's one thing to sound good in a campaign. It's one thing to go around. But when you get in, you've got to be able to bring all this to fruition. If we don't do that, we're not going to be able to reverse the decline that our country's in.""

Today in Iowa, Mike Pence called on his competitors in the Republican presidential field to unambiguously stand with Israel, America's strongest ally. Read Pence's full comments below:
""I call on this administration to make it clear, not just to Hamas, but also to Tehran, that America will go to any extent necessary that Israel is able to defend itself.
""I also believe it's absolutely essential that we call out leaders in the Republican Party.
""This is not a territorial dispute in Israel today — this is an unprovoked act of war by Hamas and their sponsors in Tehran. Voices of appeasement like Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Ron DeSantis, I believe have run contrary to the tradition in our party where America is the leader of the free world.
""If I'm President of the United States, we're going to send a strong and unambiguous message that America will be leading with strength once again on the world stage. Appeasement will only continue to embolden the forces of Hamas, their terrorist sponsors in Iran and elsewhere around the world. I think this is testament to the fact that we need new leadership in the White House, but we also need leadership in the Republican Party that understands the stakes, that understands we achieve peace through strength. And as President of the United States, I'll stand strong. If the world knows nothing else, the world will know this: America stands with Israel and and America will stand without apology as the leader of the free world.
""Israel is our most cherished ally so I call on every one of my competitors in this race to make it clear that America stands with Israel.
""But I also want to call on Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Ron DeSantis to stop the language of appeasement as war rages in Eastern Europe.
""Last night we saw an unprovoked attack by Hamas on Israel. A year and a half ago we saw an unprovoked attack by Russia on Ukraine. And I believe we are in the midst of a time in history where the enemies of freedom are on the move because they sense weakness. Appeasement and isolationism are weakness.
""And I call on Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Ron DeSantis to abandon the language of appeasement — to say that we will stand strong with Israel, we will stand strong with Ukraine, we will stand as the leader of the free world. And as President of the United States, I will.""

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Breaking: Trump Scrambles the Jets to Iowa as Top Advisor Confirms Move to Hawkeye State,2023-10-06T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-breaking-trump-scrambles-the-jets-iowa-top-advisor,"
Trump campaign's recent actions in Iowa confirm two-man race between DeSantis and Trump 
Tallahassee, FL - Just days after the Trump campaign attempted to criticize Ron DeSantis for moving staff to Iowa as a sign of weakness and less than two months after MAGA Inc claimed they were ""pivoting to the general election,"" top Trump advisor Chris LaCivita confirmed to Bloomberg that this is a two-man race between Trump and DeSantis by acknowledging that he too will be relocating the Hawkeye State.
In a brutal report for the Trump team, Bloomberg noted how their recent moves in the Hawkeye State ""show the outsized importance of Iowa for Trump's campaign"" and how ""A loss [in Iowa] would damage his invincible reputation and provide an opening for DeSantis.""
""Donald Trump is very late to the game and is now scrambling his jet to Iowa because he knows just how disastrous it is going to be to lose to Ron DeSantis in January. But anyone who understands Iowa knows that a Caucus victory has to be earned - it can't be bought. Ron DeSantis has long-planted his flag in Iowa and the Trump campaign is going to have do more than spend millions of dollars against him to capture it. It's now game on."" - DeSantis deputy campaign manager David Polyansky
Bloomberg's new story comes as Trump has faced criticism for his ""lagging campaign operation"" in the Hawkeye State and as Ron DeSantis is set to visit 16 counties in Iowa this weekend, bringing his total to 74 on his way to completing the ""Full Grassley.""
The highlights from Bloomberg's story are below and you can read the full article HERE.
Donald Trump is intensifying efforts to win the Iowa Republican caucuses, trying to avoid a less-than-muscular victory in a critical early state
Trump nonetheless wants to leave nothing to chance, given he faces what will be a fiercely contested challenge there from his chief rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and still bears scar tissue from his 2016 second-place finish in the state.
There are discussions within Trump's campaign about one of his top advisers, Chris LaCivita, relocating temporarily to Iowa, according to people familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous to discuss internal deliberations. ""Of course I will be in Iowa,"" LaCivita said when asked about the plans
Trump's director for early voting states, Alex Latcham, is also shifting more of his focus to Iowa in lieu of other contests, people familiar with the matter said. And the campaign placed another aide over its state director, Marshall Moreau, who now reports to Alex Meyer.
Trump's super PAC, MAGA Inc., has $2.4 million in ad time reserved in Iowa for the rest of October, according to ad data. And the former president himself has two stops in Iowa on Saturday, a ""commit to caucus"" event in Waterloo and a speech in Cedar Rapids. His son, Don Jr., is also expected to speak at an Iowa fundraiser this month, people familiar said.
Taken together, the decisions show the outsized importance of Iowa for Trump's campaign...A loss [in Iowa] would damage his invincible reputation and provide an opening for DeSantis
Caucusing is more complicated than casting a traditional primary ballot and Trump's advisers are aware a portion of their supporters have not participated in a caucus before. There's a widespread effort to teach supporters about the process and ensure they're registered to vote, aides said.
Trump is also aware DeSantis' support for a six-week abortion ban could help his rival make in-roads among Iowa Republican voters, who tend to be more socially conservative than those in other early states, according to people familiar with his thinking
DeSantis's campaign is moving about a dozen staff members to Iowa, from Tallahassee, Florida. DeSantis, after three weeks without an Iowa visit, will do 19 stops in three days, and will have visited 74 of its 99 counties by the end of this weekend, aides said.

""In Florida, I'm a leader. I'm not an entertainer, I'm not running a soap opera down here. I make promises to people and then I use the authority that I have and I work with the legislature to deliver the promises."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined CNBC's Squawk Box. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On building the border wall and making Mexico pay for it:
This weekend in Iowa, [Trump] said his famous promise that he made in 2016: he was going to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it. We all remember that. And he said, 'Well, there was no legal mechanism for me to do that. I couldn't have Mexico pay for it. You can't just ask them for money for a wall.' And so that was basically a central promise. So that to me was something that I was taken aback by. But the thing is, you actually could have Mexico pay for it. Yeah, they're not just going to cut you a check. You impose fees on remittances from people that are sending money back to Mexico and other countries. And he was advised that he could have done that. And he didn't do it. So I think ultimately, the choice for Republicans is, do we want somebody who's going to produce the leadership and results that will turn this country around? You ask, is Florida success replicable nationally? Of course it is. What they have in DC is theatrics, it's performative, but it doesn't actually produce results for people. In Florida, I'm a leader. I'm not an entertainer, I'm not running a soap opera down here. I make promises to people and then I use the authority that I have and I work with the legislature to deliver the promises. And so the results speak for themselves.
On how he'll deliver on his promises as President:
We'll be energetic. We will be out there. But I also understand the authorities of the office. I know how to use leverage, and then I also know, how do you actually get this stuff in for a landing? So for example, all the things we're talking about now, we're thinking to January 20th, 2025. How do you get it done? Budget reconciliation in the Senate, Biden used that to do his agenda. We're going to use that for our agenda so we're not just out there flailing around. We have a plan to get it done. And when I'd say this in Florida, when I got elected, Florida was viewed as the most significant closely divided state. Most of the races were one-point races, governor races, presidential races. I came in with a narrow margin and we ended up turning that into a 20-point victory. We brought people together. Yeah, the far left, we fought and we beat the far left, but I think that's what we need to do nationally. I do think that there's a strong majority of this country that wants a restoration of sanity. They want to see government focus on their needs and not the needs of the people in DC. And that's what I'll represent. And it'll be a bottom-up movement.
On why he is the best candidate for President:
Some people will be with Trump no matter what, but I think the bulk of the people are people that appreciate what he did. They also understand that he's got limitations in terms of his electability. He would be a lame duck on day one if he could even get elected. I think he'd have major problems with personnel. And of course, he didn't deliver on his core promises to drain the swamp, to have Mexico pay for the border wall, or to eliminate the debt. He added $7.8 trillion to the debt. So that's all fair game. We're going to be able to make that case, and I've delivered on these policies better than anybody.

""We must embrace our founding documents because they set people free.""– Tim Scott
DALLAS COUNTY, IA – Last night, Tim Scott joined The Mark Levin Show from the campaign trail in Iowa. They discussed the importance of championing our nation's founding principles to uplift American families.
LISTEN HERE
Mark Levin: Welcome back America. I'm gonna tell you why I like Tim Scott. This man is a gentleman. Even when he's in the midst of a firefighter debate, he's still a gentleman. He says things that other people won't say. He has integrity. You know that he means what he says. He's a man who understands history. He and his family have lived history. He is a conservative. He is a Republican. He believes in liberty. And I have to be honest with you folks, he comes under attack because he doesn't fit the left wing stereotype. And yet he's the happy warrior. He keeps moving along and he keeps talking to the electorate throughout the country and during these debates. And whenever he speaks, I pay attention to it....
Sen Scott: Well, Mark, I gotta tell you, I'm a fan of Frederick Douglas too and Abraham Lincoln. And what those two men understood, it was to celebrate our Founding Fathers. Not because they were perfect, they were flawed, but it was the Constitution that was the anchor to absolute truth. And absolute truth is how we set people free. You see, Frederick Douglas understood that our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence gave inalienable rights. The Declaration says, well, our rights don't come from each other. They come from a Creator. And amongst those rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We must embrace our founding documents because they set people free. And the radical Left, they're willing to lock poor kids into failing schools by having the teachers unions standing at the doorway of the schoolhouse trapping them in, and the DAs in these liberal elite cities unlocking the jailhouse and letting people out. It is just disgusting.
Mark Levin: It is disgusting. And you mentioned in the last debate something that almost nobody else would. And yet it's the truth. There've been scholars who've written about it, even Patrick Moynihan wrote about it many years ago, the Democrat who became a Democrat senator from New York, which is that these social programs destroy the family, the poor, particularly the Black family. They destroy the nuclear family and they destroy the whole work ethic. And you so far have been the only one who's even mentioned that. Tell me a little bit more about that.
Sen Scott: Well, Mark, if you think about it. Listen, slavery was a great evil upon our nation. I make no excuses. I pull no punches. Slavery was evil. No good came out of slavery. But I must concede, and we should all take a close look, that the Black family coming out of slavery, we survived poll taxes and literacy tests, and even discrimination woven into the laws of our country. But the Great Society introduced by LBJ devastated poor and particularly Black families by making the exchange, forcing the man out of the house so checks would come in the mail. The result of that has been devastation that you measure in these big blue cities in crime and in unemployment, in uneducated people. And hope deferred makes the heart sick.
It is time for us to tell the whole story, Mark, that in the 1960s, 70 plus percent of Black kids grew up with two parents in the household. In the 2020s, 70% of Black kids are growing up in a single parent household. And that is foreshadowing for the rest of the country. Now, 40% of white kids in working class families are growing up in a single parent household. If you wanna know if socialism works, take a look at the devastation around our nation. And I must stand up and shout from the rooftops if I can't reach the mountain tops, because I was that poor kid growing up in a single parent household, mired in poverty. But thank God Almighty, I was given the greatest citizenship on Earth in America. You can rise beyond your circumstances. You can chart a new course. That's rare on Earth.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on The Hugh Hewitt Show,2023-10-05T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-the-hugh-hewitt-show-0,"
""We need order, we need smooth government operations, and we need to deliver results. That's what we've done in Florida for the last five years, and you see the contrast."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Hugh Hewitt from Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt Show. Read the highlights below.
Listen here.
On Florida's success versus DC's disfunction:
It's a strong contrast to how we do business in Florida. I think you see a lot of theater, a lot of chaos; I'm not sure it ever leads to any results. Whereas in Florida, everything we do is calculated to deliver outcomes and to create a better life for the people down here. I also think, just reflecting on, you had like, what five or six members, Republicans joined all these Democrats, you know, we were supposed to have a red wave in 2022. And that didn't happen. It happened in Florida, and we delivered four additional Republicans. But that was one of the best environments to run in for Republicans probably since like the 1940s, and we totally muffed it. And I think that this is part of the follow on from that. But we just need leadership. I mean, we need to put leaders out there, deliver for the folks that we represent. So I think that we need order, we need smooth government operations, and we need to deliver results. That's what we've done in Florida for the last five years, and you see the contrast.
On the threat of the Chinese Communist Party:
We need a whole of society approach to fending off the CCP. This is our top threat. This decade will be the decisive decade. This is a military confrontation, perhaps, technological, economic, cultural -- all of those things. We need to have national policy geared towards fending off the CCP. And I think that Washington's policy, the DC kind of smart set, they've had all bark and very little bite with respect to China. I think on the current course, China will surpass us as we get into next decade. So some of the things we're going to do -- you need more hard power in the Indo-Pacific. We are going to have a naval build up. We'll shoot for 355 ships after the first term, and we'll get to 385 ships after term two. But, I think even more importantly than that, reinvigorating our defense industrial base and our shipbuilding capacity so that within 20 years, we could get close to 600 ships. I think that we had an opportunity when COVID hit to really mobilize the country behind a common purpose of fending off the CCP. And we could have started doing some of this naval build up there. But that's really, really important. And so we're going to do that, but I think everything we do is going to be viewed through the prism of how do we counter the China threat? Obviously, there's other threats in the world, and we'll deal with those. But just like Reagan dealt with the Soviets above all else, we need our grand strategy to focus on China above all else.
On the importance of domestic energy production:
We can stop empowering Russia through a dysfunctional energy policy. You can have the Green New Deal -- I don't want that; I think it's bad -- but just understand, when you go in Biden's direction, you are helping Russia, you're helping Iran, you're helping Venezuela, and you're also helping China. So we put out, in Midland, Texas a couple of weeks ago, our plan for American energy dominance. We're going to choose Midland over Moscow, we're going to choose the Marcellus over the Mullahs, and we're going to choose Bakken over Beijing. Biden is effectively funding both sides of that conflict. His energy policy helps Moscow. He's also relieved sanctions on Iran. And then, of course, through the 6 billion. They're very much invested in helping Russia with all those things. But I think we have the economic levers to be able to weaken Russia, and that's just beyond the current conflict. That is what they rely on. And Biden's energy policy will make Russia more powerful. My energy policy will weaken Russia.
On providing an alternative to Bidenomics:
I think they need to be discussing the economy, particularly why we're in this mess. I think it's important to point out it all started with COVID in March of 2020. There was massive borrowing, printing, and spending under both Republicans and Democrats. That's led to the interest rates being where they are, and it's put a lot of people in a world of hurt. We obviously need to reverse those policies. We need to discuss Biden's attempt to impose an ideological control over the economy, whether that's the Green New Deal, whether that's other things that they're doing in all aspects of the economy. It's bad for freedom, and it's ultimately going to be very bad for our standard of living. We need to talk about having energy independence and energy dominance. We do need to talk about the border and our sovereignty and the fentanyl overdoses that are happening as a result of that. That moderator in the other debate was trying to blame Americans for the fentanyl overdoses. I was shocked that she would even try to do something like that. We need to talk about the growth of the administrative state. How are we going to re-constitutionalize government and end weaponization of agencies like the IRS and the FBI? You know, those are all really, really significant issues that, you know, I run the table nationally, we're going to have a house and senate majority, we're going to have opportunities to get a lot of this stuff done. So we're going to be ready to go on day one.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Need to Know with Jeff Angelo,2023-10-05T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-need-know-with-jeff-angelo,"
""I'm the only candidate that will do all 99 counties; and I'm the one candidate that actually believes I have to earn your vote."" 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Ron DeSantis joined Need to Know with Jeff Angelo live on WHO Radio. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On the importance of hitting all 99 counties in Iowa:
I visited 58 of the 99 counties. We're going to be through Iowa this weekend, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. I think we're going to probably hit close to 70 by the time we're done with this trip, which is really, really exciting. And I think, you know, being an Iowa, sometimes people outside of Iowa don't understand, when you're showing up at all 99 counties, you know, that's not something that's going to show up in like poll results or anything. You know, you're laying groundwork, you're building relationships, you're earning support, that come to fruition on caucus night. I'm the only candidate that will do all 99 counties. And I'm the one candidate that actually believes I have to earn your vote. I'm not entitled to your vote. I'm going to be there making the case of why I should be the next president. And you know what, we've gotten a great response from all segments of Iowa, it's been great. We've got great endorsements from political leadership, got great support from evangelicals, agriculture leaders. I mean, it's really, really been good. So, we've got the makings of a dynamite campaign, and we're going to run it all the way through the Iowa caucuses, and we look forward to doing that.
On illegal immigration and making Mexico pay for the border wall:
I started the transportation program when Florida transported 50 illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard in 2022. And you see what the border towns are going through. This is just 50 in a very wealthy area that had advertised itself as being a sanctuary jurisdiction. And yet, what did they do? They freaked out, and they sent them off the island the next day. New York City used to virtue signal about how they were a sanctuary. Now the mayor is out there saying that the open border is going to destroy the city. We have liberal governors in Illinois and Massachusetts and New York now saying that this just doesn't work. And the reality is, this is stuff we've been saying from the very beginning, just the sheer number of people is overwhelming health systems, schools, you do have criminal aliens, you have the cartels moving in massive amounts of product that's killing Americans in record numbers. This is a massive dereliction of duty by Joe Biden. You have a responsibility as President to secure our country. That should be the first order of business. And what I've said is as President, we're going to declare it a national emergency on day one. We're going to have military at the border. I will build the border wall, and I'll actually have Mexico pay for it. You know, Donald Trump was actually in Iowa last weekend, and he's like, you know, there was no way I could have Mexico pay for it, even though he had promised that; he said there's no legal mechanism to do it. There actually is. It's not telling Mexico to pay, it's imposing fees on the remittances that people send from America back to Mexico -- mostly Mexican nationals, also central South American nationals. So, you could do that. It'll generate billions of dollars. You'll have the funds to be able to do the full wall construction. And then I was the first candidate to say that we're going to use lethal force against the drug cartels because they're invading our country, they're killing our people. Commander in Chief not only has the right, you have the duty to fight back.
On fixing the problems in Washington:
We're at a situation in our country where we are going in the wrong direction, where people see that, and even people who are not Republicans -- people that may disagree with me and you on a lot of issues -- they understand things need to change. And so, we have an opportunity to harness a lot of people. It'll be bottom up. It'll be people pressuring their representatives to do the right thing. The last time we really saw that was when President Reagan came in. President Reagan had a Democrat-controlled house, and he got his whole agenda through. Not because the Democrat leadership wanted to do it. It is because that's what the people were demanding. So that's one thing, and that's really the secret of how we did it in Florida. It wasn't me browbeating legislators -- because everything I promised I'd do, we got 100% done -- it was people throughout the state who were like, you got to get behind the governor, his vision is what we need. Do that, and it'll be the same thing. I'll come in with a mandate. The other thing is you've got to be -- in Washington, it's such a cesspool. The media is going to want you to fail, the bureaucracy is going to be against you, obviously, the institutional left, all these different things. So, you've got to know where true north is. And you've got to be focused. You've got to be disciplined. You can't get distracted. You can't be causing side controversies. It's all about the mission. And that's -- when I was in the military serving in places like Iraq, you check everything else at the door, and it's all about accomplishing the mission. So, I'll be a very determined President, I'll be very focused, and my issues that I'm going to be pursuing are going to be your issues. They're not going to be issues that are unique to me. I'm going to make sure we get the job done, and you have got to be ready to hit the ground on day one. You're going to have 100, 150 days where you're going to be at your high watermark in that first term. You got to strike. We're going to have all the executive orders ready on day one. We'll have all the legislation -- working with the key members of Congress -- ready to go January 2025. And we're going to have thousands of personnel and appointments ready to go to deploy, so that we can rein in the administrative state and the bureaucracy. But that's got to be day one, and it's just got to be focused and discipline. And it's all about delivering results. It's not about -- I think some of what I see in Washington, I see a lot of fanfare. I see a lot of virtue signaling. I see a lot of entertainment. Look, I'm a leader, I'm not an entertainer. My job is to turn this country around and to make sure that you, your kids, and grandkids have a shot at the American dream. And I will get that done.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - 60 Bipartisan Florida Law Enforcement Officers Endorse Ron DeSantis for President,2023-10-05T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-60-bipartisan-florida-law-enforcement-officers-endorse-ron,"
DeSantis locks in more endorsements than 2022 gubernatorial race 
Tampa, FL - Ron DeSantis today received endorsements for president from 60 bipartisan Florida law enforcement officers, a larger number of endorsements than received in his 2022 gubernatorial re-elect. The endorsements come as DeSantis has been recognized in early nominating states for his actions as governor to back the blue and sign strong anti-crime laws, resulting in a 50-year low crime rate in Florida.
""As a leader, and as a family man, Ron DeSantis knows that supporting law enforcement is critical to keeping families and communities safe. Demonstrating that supporting law enforcement means more than just talk by securing bonuses, increased funding, and programs to support law enforcement families, Governor DeSantis has undoubtedly made this a stronger state. America's Governor will take this same action focused and common-sense approach to Washington as President,"" said Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody.
""Ron DeSantis has been unwavering in his support for law enforcement, which is why I am proud to endorse him today to be the next president of the United States. Our nation needs a leader who will bring back law and order to our communities. The people in the major metropolitan areas deserve to be safe, too. As President of the United States, he will fight to curtail runaway violent crime,"" said Sheriff Grady Judd (R -- Polk).
""Ron DeSantis doesn't just talk about backing the blue, he has delivered results for law enforcement officers and their families, from pay raises and bonuses to ensuring they have what they need to do their job and being very clear that he is on the side of law and order. Crime has gotten out of control in this country, but not in Florida. America desperately needs Ron DeSantis to go into the White House on Day One and replace Joe Biden's soft-on-crime policies with his agenda to back the blue and protect our communities,"" said Sheriff Wayne Ivey (R -- Brevard).
In January 2022, a bipartisan group of 59 sheriffs endorsed DeSantis for Governor of Florida, dubbing him the ""Law and Order"" governor.
As governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis enacted numerous new laws to support law enforcement, including signing bonuses of up to $5,000 for new officers, resulting in law enforcement from across the country fleeing to Florida. Governor DeSantis has also enacted tough-on-crime laws, such as increasing sentences for drug traffickers that target children and dealing out the death penalty to child rapists.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Responds To Bowman: The Radical Left Uses Race As A Weapon To Escape Their Failures,2023-10-04T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-responds-bowman-the-radical-left-uses-race-weapon,"
""When I stand up to fight for the defenseless, when I give voice to the voiceless, it scares the dickens out of the radical Left."" – Tim Scott
DALLAS COUNTY, IA –  Today, Tim Scott joined The Mike Gallagher Show on Salem Radio Network. They spoke about Congressman Jamaal Bowman's disparaging comments about Tim and the liberal rage that ensued from Tim's standout debate performance.
LISTEN HERE
Tim Scott: Mike it's the craziest thing ever. I will say that as a guy who's been discriminated against for many years of my life, I understand racism personally and intimately. Today's racists seem to wear the blue shirt more than it ever has in my opinion. Bottom line is simply this, that in today's America, the racist attacks I receive oftentimes, if not universally, comes from the radical left. They have weaponized race and class, Mike, for one purpose. It is to hold on to political power. You saw the Congressman [Bowman] yesterday referred to me as a Sambo. That is racistly racist. It is derogatory and unacceptable. But he's not an idiot. He is malicious. He's the guy that pulls the alarm in the House of Representatives, and to cover his tracks what does he do? He does what Joe Biden and the radical Left do. Every single time they hide behind the race card or the class card, they are willing to divide this country.
They're willing to tell young kids in the inner cities, living in poverty and single parent households, that you better shut up and sit down if you're not going to vote blue. That is the kind of demoralizing, debilitating message that comes from the radical Left. And they will use any group, anyone, any issue to hold on to their political power. It is disgusting, but it is consistent with the radical Left's desire to hold on to power. And they love weaponizing the issue of race against me. Mike, you know this as well as anybody else. When I wrote the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they called me a prop. When I started working on refunding the police, they called me a token. When I pushed back on Joe Biden's agenda, they even called me the N word. But the proof of my life destroys the lies of the radical left. I'm running for president because I know America can, can do for anyone what she's done for me. And we have to restore hope and protect America at the exact same time. And I will be the man standing in the fire because I've benefited too much from this amazing country and the God who I serve....
Tim Scott: ...That is dangerous. However, to the radical Left, who wants to use race as a weapon to escape their failures. Think about big blue cities like Washington D.C. where you see a Democrat Congress member being carjacked. But frankly, it's not just a member of Congress, it's everyday people who live in fear. Grandmothers in Chicago and Los Angeles and D.C. are locked into their homes from the time the sun goes down until the time the sun comes up because of the crime spree that these liberal elites have unleashed on the poorest most vulnerable communities. And when I stand up to fight for the defenseless, when I give voice to the voiceless, it scares the dickens out of the radical Left, not because they just wanna punish me, they wanna punish any person of color who dares to stand up and think for themselves that the Great Opportunity Party might have the solutions that have failed to manifest after generation, after generation, after generation in these liberal cities.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Local TV in Iowa,2023-10-04T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-local-tv-iowa,"
""Governor DeSantis ended the interview sharing that with him in charge, you're going to have a president who supports the people who wear the uniform."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis spoke with local TV reporters from Iowa during a virtual press conference yesterday.
KHQA in Keokuk, IA. Watch here.
REPORTER: Well, Governor DeSantis has definitely made his mark on communities across the tri-state area and beyond, whether that was from his Never Back Down campaign tour, or from folks catching his law enforcement recruitment billboards in major surrounding cities. Today we spoke on recent presidential polls and his plan moving forward. Polls don't elect presidents; voters elect presidents. Now that's a quote from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at last week's Republican presidential debate, when asked what Governor DeSantis' plan would be to beat former President Donald Trump. Now after speaking with the governor Tuesday, we asked DeSantis what he thought of the recent polls. How you're feeling about where your polls stand. On the debate floor, you did say polls don't elect presidents; voters elect presidents. So what would you have to say about that?
GOV DESANTIS: Well look, I mean, I think that every poll that was done after the debates said I won -- and really comfortably. All the focus groups said that we won the debate. And I think part of it is for a couple of reasons. One, I'm the only person that has actually done and achieved the things that we're talking about. I've delivered results, whereas a lot of these other candidates just have talked about it.
REPORTER : The governor continued to share he thinks he elevated the discussions on the debate floor while the other candidates were harping on each other. And speaking of the debate floor, Governor DeSantis made sure to share and show support for our country's law enforcement.
GOV DESANTIS CLIP: In Florida, we back the blue. We support the men and women of law enforcement.
MACKENZIE: Now in recent weeks, Governor DeSantis hasn't just made stops in Iowa. His recruitment billboards have made it to cities like Chicago.
GOV DESANTIS: These officers are risking their lives. A lot of times, the judges put the criminals back on the street. And I know in Illinois, they have a no cash bail. Los Angeles just enacted no cash bail. It's going to be a carousel of these criminals getting in, getting put out, committing more crimes, and doing. Why are you going to be risking your life if they're going to put them back on the street, and you're not going to be appreciated for what you do?
REPORTER: Now, these billboards from DeSantis gave law enforcement recruitment bonuses for those who move to Florida from out of state or who are Florida residents but are new to the industry. Governor DeSantis ended the interview sharing that with him in charge, you're going to have a president who supports the people who wear the uniform. Working for you, I'm Mackenzie Laporte.
REPORTER: Thanks, Mackenzie. Governor DeSantis also shared that he is going to continue on his 99-county tour of Iowa, so keep an eye out at KHQA.com because he could be coming to a town near you soon.
Fox 18 in Quad Cities. Watch here.
REPORTER: Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis held an online news conference today for journalists in Iowa. Your local election headquarters is tracking campaign 2024. DeSantis emphasized he would follow up on promises and get results. He thinks Americans want a president who gets results for the people. DeSantis claims he could do it based on his time as Florida's governor. Someone asked him about the future of other presidential candidates. DeSantis says it'll be him and Donald Trump fighting for the Republican nomination.
GOV DESANTIS: Those are the two candidates. And yes, I mean, would it be easier if it was one on one? Yeah, it would be, but I think our view is we're going to amass the support of Iowans that we need, that even if it remains a crowded field, I think you're going to see it.
KHQA in Keokuk, IA. Watch here.
REPORTER: New information: in recent weeks, Governor Ron DeSantis has put up law enforcement recruitment billboards across many major cities like Chicago. These billboards come after the new Illinois law, The Safety Act, took effect earlier this month, eliminating cash bail for a number of crimes. DeSantis says these billboards are to show police and first responders that they are valued and supported in Florida, something he says they don't have here in Illinois.
GOV DESANTIS: But one of the things we noticed that we were one of the states that was stepping up to back the law enforcement. A lot of these other states -- Illinois was not good, Washington State, California, whatnot -- these folks were not being treated well in their communities. There were efforts to defund police.
REPORTER: The billboards promise law enforcement recruitment bonuses for those who moved to Florida from out of state or those who are Florida residents but are new to the industry. Governor DeSantis said that they have recruited law enforcement from several major cities already, including Chicago.
KMTV in Southwest, IA. Watch here.
REPORTER: Governor, thanks for taking a few of our questions. As you know, one of the biggest political stories right now is the battle in the speaker, for Speaker of the House. Do you think it's time for Speaker Kevin McCarthy to step aside? Is it time for new leadership in the House?
GOV DESANTIS: Well, you know, I opposed McCarthy when it wasn't cool years ago. And he's really somebody that Donald Trump has backed and put into that position. And so I think that they've not delivered results. I think the contrast between Florida, us delivering results, and what you have in Washington is typically failure theater. Now this whole movement to do this motion, look, I think a lot of that is performative. I think a lot of that is the typical theatrics that we're used to saying, I'm not sure how much thought is going into that. But I can tell you this, our voters want to see results. We're sick of the talk. And a lot of these DC Republicans have promised all these things over the years and then when it comes time they don't deliver. I mean the most recent budget bill they passed after spending nine months complaining about the open border, complaining about inflation, complaining about weaponization of federal agencies. All of that stuff is continuing with no course correction at all. I would say the government is spending too much money that's why you are paying more for everything you're doing. Government sparked the inflation crisis that we have, government sparked the high interest rates that people are laboring under, and that's hurting families who are trying to afford a home. It's also hurting businesses who are trying to make ends meet, particularly small businesses. But you have right now, a family that bought the average priced home five years ago, compared to the family that buys the average price home today, that mortgage payment today is over twice as much on a monthly basis than it would have been five years ago with that average price. And so this is because of what they've done in Washington. So we need a whole different approach, I will be able to bring that approach as president, because I think that unfortunately, it looks like they're going to just continue doing a lot of the same old stuff that hasn't worked in the past.
REPORTER: If speaker McCarthy is soon out of a job, is there any name any Republican friend of yours that you'd like to see as Speaker of the House?
GOV DESANTIS: Oh, man, I don't know if I would wish that job on any of my friends, to be honest with you. There's a lot of great guys out there that are working really hard. You know, I got guys that have endorsed me like Chip Roy and Congressman Tom Massie. I think Chip is somebody that really, really understands how you move this country in a better direction and he's a real leader on policy. And I think Tom Massie, you know, when they were doing the COVID lock downs, and they did the $2.2 trillion in March of 2020. Massie held it up. He said, You can't just voice vote this. And he said, this is going to lead to supply chain problems. It's going to lead to people dropping out of the labor force, and it's going to lead to inflation. He was pilloried at the time for saying that. Donald Trump said he should be run out of the Republican Party for saying that. But if you go back and look what Tom Massie said in March of 2020, he was right. He was right on all those issues, that set the stage for a lot of the economic problems that we have. So those are two good guys, there's a lot more, a lot more good guys. But I think it's a thankless job, so I'm not sure that they would want to sign up for it.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - The Ron DeSantis Comeback Continues: DeSantis Raises $15 Million in Third Quarter,2023-10-04T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-the-ron-desantis-comeback-continues-desantis-raises-15,"
Shatters expectations of those who wrote him off this summer 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis shattered expectations by bringing in $15 million during the third quarter fundraising period between his campaign committee, leadership PAC, and joint fundraising committee. The haul is the most emphatic signal yet that the momentum behind his comeback candidacy is continuing to build as we near the 100 day countdown to the Iowa Caucus.
""Anyone that knows Ron DeSantis knows that he is a fighter, a winner, and a leader,"" said campaign manager James Uthmeier. ""This significant fundraising haul not only provides us with the resources we need in the fight for Iowa and beyond, but it also shuts down the doubters who counted out Ron DeSantis for far too long. Ron DeSantis is the only candidate with the vision to reverse America's decline and the track record to prove he will get the job done. Thanks to the generous support of Americans looking for a leader who will deliver results, this campaign is built to last and win. Ron DeSantis is the only candidate in this race who can beat both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, revive our economy, secure the border, make America energy dominant, and end the weaponization of government once and for all.""
The announcement of DeSantis' narrative-defying third quarter comes as he enters October firmly on offense. During the last two months, DeSantis has:Won both the first and second GOP debate.Unveiled three new forward-looking policies.Economic policyFaith policyEnergy policyDrawn a stark contrast with Donald Trump on key issues like support for the families of the victims of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, life, Trump's embrace of Fauci during COVID, border security, and spending — all while challenging him to debate his record and vision for the future.Significantly ramped up his media appearances with renewed focus on mainstream media and non-traditional media.Campaigned at break-neck pace (by next Monday he will have visited 74 of Iowa's 99 counties) that has lured Trump to battle him in Iowa despite the former president's team in August saying they had already moved on to the general election.Trump is now attempting to ramp up visits to the state after reports his organization is far behind DeSantis' in Iowa.Trump's PAC is spending heavily on TV in Iowa and is currently driving over $250,000 in negative mailers aimed at DeSantis in the state despite claiming in August they were pivoting to the general election.

""I can tell you, as President, when I get in there, we'll provide the leadership. We're not going to provide chaos and drama. We're just going to provide an agenda that we can get done and turn the country around."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Your World with Fox News' Neil Cavuto. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On Donald Trump's failure to deliver on the border wall:
He was talking about his promise to have Mexico pay for the border wall, probably one of the most important, most famous promises in political history, certainly the centerpiece of his 2016 campaign. And what he said was really startling. He said, you know, 'People, you know, say Mexico should have paid for the wall, but he said there was no way he could have ever made Mexico pay' and basically admitted that the whole promise was phony from the beginning. So one, I think that that's really bad. I think this is a different guy in '23 than he was in 2016. But the problem even bigger, you actually could have made Mexico pay. No, they're not just going to cut you a check. You impose fees on remittances from people sending money back to Mexico. That's actually something that his staff said he was interested in doing, and he didn't do it. So that's why he needs to go to these debates. You can't beat the Democrats by running Biden's basement strategy. You owe it to the voters to show up, and you need to defend your record, and you need to show then how you're going to be the guy to get the job done.
On Kevin McCarthy:
I was one of the guys that opposed McCarthy before it was cool. You know, now you're in a situation where they haven't produced results, and that's just the reality. At the same time, though, I look at guys like Chip Roy, Tom Massie, Jim Jordan, and they're basically saying that there's not a plan to go forward with whatever Matt Gaetz is doing. And so I'm somebody, if I go down a road, I will deliver results for it. I'm not just going to do it and flail around. It's not going to just be about fundraising. I would have a plan in place to be able to deliver what I promised to deliver. I'm not sure that there's a plan in place on this. When I see the Republican Congressman pointing out that there's a lot of fundraising going on around that, you know, that makes me uncomfortable. I think when you're doing things, you need to be doing it because it's the right thing to do. It shouldn't be done with an eye towards trying to generate lists or trying to generate fundraising. And so, that is not the way I would operate. When we operate, we do what we think is right and let the chips fall where they may. You know, sometimes when you do the right thing, you do get more support. And that's just the nature of it. But that shouldn't be what's driving any of this, and I'd hope that that's not the case.
On action over failure theater:
Leadership starts at the top. And so you have different members that go, but I think the leader has got to get people in line and try to deliver the victories. But I look at an issue like the border and immigration, and I think that the failure theater that we've seen out of Republicans is 'Oh, well, we only have the house. How are we going to be able to do anything?' But you look, we have the mayor of New York City saying that the city is going to be destroyed because of Biden's open border. You have the governor of New York now acknowledging that this doesn't work. The governor of Illinois is writing letters. So I do think if leadership is provided, you can make headway when it comes to this border because you have very liberal Democrat politicians that are acknowledging that this can't continue. So what I want to see, is I want to see Republicans lead that effort in Washington to be able to give the American people relief from the border situation that is overwhelming not just border cities, it's overwhelming cities all throughout the country.
On the importance of debating:
And yes, we should have that debate. We should have more debates. Donald Trump should show up at the debates. And I do think that they should narrow the debates with the candidates that have met the thresholds of really having a chance to compete in these early states. I'm clearly one of those. I don't know that there's that many more. That would, I think, draw more interest from people, and I think it would probably put more pressure on Donald Trump to actually show up and debate.
On the battle for Iowa:
[Trump] is currently spending money against me in Iowa. He is campaigning in Iowa. And that's an indication -- you can tell campaigns by what they do. So yes, people are going to try to create whatever narratives they want. But he's they're spending money attacking me. And he's spent over $25 million in this campaign attacking me, by the way, that shows you that they do view me as the threat. So you've got to earn this, I'm going to earn it. I've done 58 of the 99 counties in Iowa. We're going to do all 99. I challenge Donald Trump to match me, show up in all these communities, and earn their vote. And that's what we're going to do. And it's a state-by-state process. Anyone can take a national poll, but ultimately, you've got to go earn the votes there locally. And they're showing you that they think it's a race because they wouldn't be behaving in the way that they're doing if they didn't think it was a race.
On taking on the DC swamp as president:
I think the voters are going to expect certainly all Republicans to support our agenda. And I don't think we're going to have any problems. And of all the governors in the country, I think I've probably worked better with my legislature down in Florida. We've had a run of success that is second to none. I understand, they get elected uncertain priorities. I want to help them with their priorities, and I want them to help me, and so you work together to be able to advance a common agenda. We've shown that it can be done here. Look, Washington is swamp. It's definitely more difficult. There's no question about it. But it's a town in need of leadership, and I think only the president can provide that leadership. And we really haven't had a president that's had big success with Congress since President Reagan when he came in. We need to do it now because if we don't get this done, we only have a short amount of time, short amount of window to be able to turn the country around. You've got to go in there, January 20, 2025. You've got to be ready to go on day one. You've got to have your appointments ready, executive orders ready, you've got to have the legislation lined up with the relevant congressmen and senators, and then you don't have a minute to waste, and you need 100-150 days where you're knocking out the country's problems. I'll be ready on day one, I'll be an energetic executive, and we will be on offense for a change.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined KDTH's Cindy Kohlmann on Voices of the Tri-States. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On California's failed leftist policies:
If it's about greed, then why is California's [gas] $7 and other parts of the country is $3.50, $3.75 -- which is also still too high? It's because California has very left-wing policies. They drive up the cost of everything. [We did] a press conference to hold both Joe Biden and Gavin Newsom accountable for their ridiculous obsession with mandating electric vehicles and electric trucks. And that's something that's important in Iowa because liquid fuels is such an important part of the economy in the Midwest, but particularly Iowa. So I've said we're going to get rid of these EV mandates. If people want to buy it, that's one thing. But to force this down everybody's throat, it's not good for the economy, it's not good for prices and inflation, and it's going to make us more dependent on China because they're the ones that mine the things that go into these electrical vehicles. But they actually want to make big rigs electric. So the port [in Los Angeles], a big rig would have 100 mile radius, and then it would need to charge again for hours. How is that good for the supply chain? How is that good for jobs here? So they have a certain vision of imposing mandates, restricting, telling people what to do. That causes everything to be more expensive. And so you're going to see fuel prices be even higher in California.
On reversing Bidenomics and reviving American energy dominance:
My wife and I, we've got six, five, and three-year-olds. I mean, just going through the drive thru with them to get them lunch now, you see it and you feel it. Forget about affording a new house right now with interest rates being 8%. Forget about a new car; the price of cars have gone up 70%. So this is a really significant squeeze on hardworking Americans. We're going to do a few things. One, we're going to fight back against the Congress, who's trying to spend too much money. The reason why prices are where they are is because Congress borrowed, printed, and spent trillions and trillions of dollars starting with COVID in March of '20, and they kept doing it. You can't just do that infinitum without having there be a response. And inflation is a response, and so we've got to moderate that. And I will be willing to veto excessive spending like I did in Florida. By the way, in Florida, we've paid down 25% of our state's total debt that has accumulated since statehood, so we know what we're doing. Second, we're going to take all of Biden's mandates, executive orders, regs, and we're going to throw them in the trash can. This bureaucracy and what they're trying to do is holding back the economy. It's making things more expensive. We're going to provide relief. And then finally, this energy dominance. We have the ability to use resources here. We can produce American energy. It's cleaner, it's better than energy elsewhere, and that will allow Our prices -- not just at the pump, but this permeates the entire economy.
On reducing dependance on communist China:
We're going to declare economic independence from China. What's happened is we've relied so much on China for all these things that are integral to our way of life and economy. And I'm talking about things like for military equipment. I'm talking about things for pharmaceuticals, medical, all these things. And so we are going to reshore supply chains here in the United States. Part of that is by holding China accountable for ripping us off, and then incentivizing more production here in the United States. It also means training young people to be able to go into skilled trades. And that's kind of been a lost art over the last generation. People have said everyone needs to go to a four-year brick and ivy University. And while I think we have some great universities, and I think there's options there, that's not necessarily the best option for everybody. We'll be able to build more manufacturing here if we have a pipeline from both high schools and trade schools into these professions. In Florida, we now have vocational education in our middle schools, and we graduate high school students with certifications in things like welding, aviation mechanics, all things that are really important. There's jobs available there. And so having the good environment, holding China accountable, and then providing that skilled workforce, I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance in this country. And it's important. I mean, look, we're a country with an economy, not the other way around. Being able to build things, make things, being able to have a strong industrial base -- that's just an important part of being a strong country.

""I think the contrast between Florida, us delivering results, and what you have in Washington is typically failure theater."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today held a virtual press conference with Iowa media. The highlights are below.
Watch the full press conference HERE.
On the spending fight in Washington and Kevin McCarthy:
I opposed McCarthy when it wasn't cool years ago. And he's really somebody that Donald Trump has backed and put into that position. I think that they've not delivered results. I think the contrast between Florida, us delivering results, and what you have in Washington is typically failure theater. Now this whole movement to do this motion, look, I think a lot of that is performative. I think a lot of that is the typical theatrics that we're used to saying, I'm not sure how much thought is going into that. But I can tell you this, our voters want to see results. We're sick of the talk. And a lot of these DC Republicans have promised all these things over the years and then when it comes time they don't deliver. I mean, the most recent budget bill they passed after spending nine months complaining about the open border, complaining about inflation, complaining about weaponization of federal agencies, all of that stuff is continuing with no course correction at all. I would say the government is spending too much money. That's why you are paying more for everything you're doing. Government sparked the inflation crisis that we have, government sparked the high interest rates that people are laboring under, and that's hurting families who are trying to afford a home. It's also hurting businesses who are trying to make ends meet, particularly small businesses. But you have, right now, a family that bought the average priced home five years ago, compared to the family that buys the average price home today, that mortgage payment today is over twice as much on a monthly basis than it would have been five years ago with that average price. And so this is because of what they've done in Washington. So we need a whole different approach. I will be able to bring that approach as president, because I think that unfortunately, it looks like they're going to just continue doing a lot of the same old stuff that hasn't worked in the past.
On building momentum in Iowa:
We continue to build great momentum in Iowa. We've done 58 of the 99 counties. We're going to be able to knock out a number of counties with our touring this weekend, and we're going to a lot of places that are more rural, that a lot, pretty much every other candidate is going to ignore. Those are things I think that, you know, may not necessarily wrap up, show a big difference overnight in like a poll or something. But I think that's the groundwork that you need to be able to win the caucuses. And so we're going through all 99, we will have that done, or at least 98 of them. We may save the last one for a big splash at some point. But we're going to have all of that done relatively soon. You know, looking forward, I know that, you know, in spite of what kind of the national media narratives may try to be, you know, Donald Trump is having now to campaign in Iowa. He had not wanted to campaign of course, he's not been doing debates, he's been missing in action from that. They're spending money against me, in Iowa. So that tells you kind of what the what the race is looking like. People can chirp and they can try to put narratives out but at the end of the day, you look at how campaigns behave in terms of what they see. So they clearly see that we're doing well, and they know and understand we're going to outwork everybody there.
On his strong support for law enforcement:
We've enacted a program, $5,000 Recruitment bonuses for anybody that comes from out of state or any new person in Florida, so young people that join law enforcement, they also get it because we want this to be a viable career path for a lot of people. So we've recruited officers from Chicago, we've recruited officers from New York City, we recruited officers from the west coast. In fact, I was in Southern California recently, and I was speaking with one of the police chiefs and I said, 'how are things going for you guys?' He said, 'It's really good. It's just all my police officers want to move to Florida and this is Southern California, which historically been a place a lot of people wanted to move to.' So we're proud of being a law and order state. All as president I'll be a law and order president. We're going to support the people that wear the uniform. We're going to have safe streets all across the country. We cannot allow these rogue prosecutors to get in and not enforce the law, let the criminals roam free, let the inmates run the asylum. That has destroyed a lot of cities in this country. It's destroyed San Francisco. It's destroying Los Angeles. It's destroyed Philadelphia. It's destroyed Baltimore. So that's going to stop when I'm president. And part of that is, you're going to have a president that supports the people that wear the uniform.

""But judging from the barrage unleashed on Sen. Tim Scott afterward, the South Carolinian hit a liberal nerve""
Tim Scott and the 'Great Society'The Wall Street Journal OpinionWilliam McGurnOctober 2, 2023
""...But judging from the barrage unleashed on Sen. Tim Scott afterward, the South Carolinian hit a liberal nerve when he trained his own fire on Democratic Party orthodoxy by targeting the failure of the Great Society.
"" 'Black families survived slavery,' Mr. Scott said. 'We survived poll taxes and literacy tests. We survived discrimination being woven into the laws of our country. What was hard to survive was [President Lyndon] Johnson's Great Society, where they decided to put money—where they decided to take the black father out of the household to get a check in the mail.'...
""Here the reaction was more telling than the remarks. Rather than rebut Mr. Scott's assertion with evidence, critics responded with sneers. The Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin wrote that Mr. Scott revealed 'the MAGA movement's desperation to rewrite history and reclaim victimhood for Whites.' Of all the 'deplorable things' Republicans said, the New Republic chimed in, Mr. Scott's remark may have been the worst.
""But the cheapest shot came from Nikole Hannah-Jones, who writes for the New York Times Sunday magazine. She is better known as the creator of the '1619 Project,' though she has backed off her initial claim that America's true founding wasn't 1776 but 1619, when the first slaves came ashore.
""'Imagine being Black and running in a political party where you believe you need to disgrace your ancestors to have a chance,' Ms. Hannah-Jones tweeted.
""Mr. Scott responded: 'When Black conservatives speak up and speak truth, folks like you say to shut up & sit down.'...
""The evidence is on his side, too. Thomas Sowell points out that in 1960—almost 100 years after slavery—only 22% of African-American children grew up in homes with one parent. Thirty years later, after the expansion of the welfare state under the Great Society, that percentages had tripled....
""But Mr. Scott's main point stands. Many of the Great Society programs he indicts have been doing their damage for decades. Isn't it time we judged them on their results and not their intentions? That would be a debate worth watching.""

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Skylar Tallal on Iowa News Now for an interview. The highlights are below.
Watch the interview HERE.
On his success in Iowa:
I would not trade places with any of these other candidates right now, in terms of where we are in Iowa. And I think we're in a better spot in Iowa today, than previous Iowa caucus winners have been at this point in the cycle in 2016, 2012, and 2008.
On being a pro-life President:
I've always said as President, I'll be pro-life. And I'll embrace pro-life policies and pro-life legislation. So it really wasn't anything different -- there'll be a lot of things I'll be able to do for sure, like end the military's abortion tourism policy, and whatnot. And I'll support pro-life legislation.
On demonstrating leadership:
You need to exercise leadership. Biden is missing an action; he's exercising no leadership. And what we have is, I think, a junta in DC that just wants to continue with a lot of the failed policies that have gotten us into this mess in the first place.

Today, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in favor of protecting the rights of families. The case, Parents Defending Education v. Linn-Mar Community School District et al, challenged a school district's policy of parental exclusion, which enabled students to begin gender transition plans without notifying their parents.
Upon learning of the Eighth Circuit's decision, Mike Pence offered the following statement:
""Today, we applaud the Eighth Circuit's decision, which is an important step in the fight to uphold and protect the rights of parents and families in Linn-Mar. A family is the single best unit to protect children, and we must continue to do everything we can to empower parents over bureaucrats. The strength of our nation is tied to the strength of our families, and we will not stand idly by as the Radical Left attempts to indoctrinate our children behind parents' backs.""

Thank you! Thanks so much! God bless y'all. Great to be in Southern California. Thanks so much. Thank you, thank you. Well, it's great to be here. I didn't know if I was even allowed. I'm a little close to Disneyland. I didn't know if they'd let me come to this, it's okay. It's okay.
We're excited to be here. We don't need teleprompters. We don't need any notes. We'll just let her rip and have a good time. We just got a taste of Southern California traffic. I did an interview for Bill Maher's show, and I guess it's somewhere in Hollywood. And we drove from there to here. And I don't know how many miles it was, but it took us about two hours to get here. So, we saw the bumper to bumper, and we were able to do that, which is I know a lot of people in Southern California have to deal with it. Of course, we had the debate in Simi Valley, the Reagan Library, on Wednesday. My wife and I, we got into town in southern California on Sunday night, and we went to Coronado and did an event at the VFW. And that was my intro to California. I was born and raised in Florida. I had never spent time in California in any meaningful way. And I was a naval officer and got orders to report to Naval amphibious base Coronado for Naval Special Warfare group one in preparation for deployment to Iraq.
So I get to Coronado, and I'm very green. And I show up and check into the bachelor officer quarters. And being a Floridian, the first thing I looked for was the air conditioning. And they said there is no air conditioning, just open your window. You don't need it. So I opened the window, and there was no screen on the window, which in Florida, we have bugs. They're like 'no, there's no bugs, you just do it.' So you open it up, you're there, and I'm like, man, I could get used to this. This is a really, really, really nice part of the world.
So we did the training, everything, deployed. And then we -- I'll never forget, after being in Iraq, not the best place in the world in terms of a lot of things, but being in that desert, and then landing at Naval Air Station, North Island on Coronado, and then getting off that C-5, and just having the freshness of the Pacific Ocean there hitting you. And man, like, I felt so pleased to be an American. And then the next morning, I'm out running on the beach outside the Hotel Del Coronado, doing all this stuff, just soaking it in.
So I have very fond memories of California, but particularly that part of California. And truth be told, growing up in Florida, I never remember seeing a single California license plate in my life. I never met anybody who had moved from California to Florida. Well, fast forward 15 years later, and I become governor, and all of a sudden we see a sea of California license plates in the state of Florida.
Now, mind you, Florida, before I got elected, Florida had always been viewed as a one-point state. You know, Democrat, Republican, I think from 2010 through '18, the governor and presidential races were all decided by one point. I understand that one of my residents was here earlier saying that he turned Florida red. All I will say is, Ronald Reagan made the point, there's no limit to what you can do when you don't care who gets the credit. I just wish if he was the one that turned Florida red, that he wouldn't have turned Georgia and Arizona blue because that's not been good for us at all.
But so it had always been one point. So, when you see California license plates, a lot of my supporters thought, uh oh, they're going to vote like they vote in California. And it's going to turn Florida blue, and we're not going to be able to have a good state anymore. And there was a lot of fear. But I'll tell you, I started meeting these people, and they would tell me why they moved. And you don't pick up and move from Southern California to Florida because of the weather. Like we got good weather most of the year. Summers aren't as good. You got good weather; you don't do that. You don't leave your friends and family behind and go thousands of miles just on a whim. These were people that were doing it because they were seeking to live in a free state that respected their rights and where they could thrive.
And we can sit here and -- I think most of you know, we're scheduled to have a little tussle with your governor on Fox News on November 30th. Now look, all I can tell you is -- and I know, like, you know, he'll pull out statistics and this and that. And I can pull out statistics, like for example, just today, Florida got ranked number one for education, freedom by the American Legislative Exchange Council. I can go all day with stuff like that. But you know, all you really have to do, you can take all the stats, you can take all that, you can just put it by the wayside, you can just ask the question, how are people actually voting with their feet? Because you can have a corporate media outlet try to trash Florida and try to put lipstick on a pig with regard to California. Of course they're going to do that; that's their agenda, their partisan agenda, but all you have to do is when people have to make decisions about themselves, about their families, about their freedom, how are they behaving? And people are leaving -- for the first time in the history of California -- people are leaving, on net, the state of California.
Where's the number one destination that people are leaving these failed blue states are going to? The Free State of Florida.
So we're going to be able to -- we'll be able to have those debates. But you know, to me, the debate about what state is governed better, Florida or California, that debate has already been answered by people voting with their feet. I think that debate is useful because California is really the petri dish for American liberalism and American leftism. And what Biden is doing are things that California was doing many years ago. What California is doing now is likely what a second Biden term would do or God forbid, Kamala Harris, or God forbid, Newsom himself. Who knows, right? That's what they would do.
So the country, our country, is in a state of decline -- economic decline, cultural decline, military decline. The California model represents more American decline. The Florida model represents a way for us to reverse American decline and represents a way to have an American revival. And that's ultimately the choice that people are going to have to make. This is our time for choosing. President Reagan said, in his day, that his generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. Well, we have a rendezvous with destiny because freedom is at risk, more so today than in any time in my adult lifetime. And we're going to be able to make the choice about whether we want to continue on the decline. We also can make the choice as Republicans, are we going to be satisfied with just managing the decline a little bit better than the Democrats? I can tell you I reject managed decline. I want reversal of the decline. And we'll do that.
So we'll be able to hash all that out. And I think it'll be fun. But what, really, we need to do, and I think what we've shown in Florida is, the Republican Party in recent years has been very long on rhetoric, very long on sending you emails asking you for money, very long on all these other things, but by and large, has been short on results. And ultimately, the only reason we should be in this room -- the only reason you should be donating your time, energy or money -- is to produce results that are good for your community, your state, and for your country. And in Florida, we have produced results that are second to none.
I get out there and get to debate on this Simi Valley and we did the other ones. And I listen, and it's fine, like, like people say, things that, I think, they think you want to hear. And that's better saying the wrong things. Don't get me wrong. But I'm the only guy on that stage that's actually delivered on every single issue that we're talking about as Republicans.
You want to talk about the economy and the budget? We know that the inflation that we're suffering under is the result of borrowing, printing, and spending by members of Congress in both parties, across two administrations over the last three and a half years, that sunk trillions and trillions of dollars into the economy, paying people not to work, doing all this other stuff. Of course, you are going to get inflation when that happens. And that is why we're in the mess. What have we done in Florida? We cut taxes by billions of dollars. We ran big budget surpluses. And since I've been governor in 2019, we've paid down 25% of our state's total outstanding debt that it accumulated its entire history as a state. So we're showing you how it's done.
You look at things, you know, we were talking about education. They're saying, well, should people be doing school choice? Yeah, we should do school choice. Yes, yes, yes. We did school choice in the state of Florida, we have universal school choice. Every parent in Florida has a right to send their kid to the school of their choosing -- maybe a private school, maybe a charter school, maybe a public school within the school district; the sky's the limit. And since we've embraced that, where does Florida rank in education? Well, we just got ranked number one by US News and World Report.
We just got ranked number -- our University of Florida just got ranked the 15th best university overall in America, including being the top ranked public university in America. No one would have thought that was possible 20, 25 years ago. I just need their football team to start doing a little bit better, and we'll be doing really well. So we've done school choice.
You want to talk about parents rights? Everyone says how important it is. We enacted the parents bill of rights in the state of Florida. Parents have the right to direct the education and upbringing of their kids. And that means you, as a parent, have a right to know what is being taught in your child's school; curriculum transparency. And unfortunately, they're trying to jam things like pornographic materials in front of very young kids. That is wrong, and in Florida, we put a stop to it. Now the media will say, and the left will say, that if a parent objects to a book in fourth grade that is pornographic and you remove that book from the fourth grade library, they'll claim that that's quote banning the book. First of all, in Florida, there's nothing banned. You as an adult can knock yourself out with that adult material. Just don't do it to the kids. Leave our kids alone.
You can go read Hunter Biden's laptop for all I care if you want to donate material, but just don't bring it to kids. So they'll do it, and they say, oh, it's banned. So what I did to ferret them out, and to smoke them out, we did a press conference about six or seven months ago titled exposing the book ban hoax. And instead of me going to the podium and talking about it, before I stepped up, before any of the parents stepped up, we just played on the video screen the images of the books that the parents had objected to. The news stations who were covering that press conference had to cut their feeds because they said it was too graphic to put on the air. Well, if it's too graphic for the six o'clock news, how is it okay for a 10 year old school child?
We complain, as Republicans, about schools and universities trying to indoctrinate kids. Yet in Florida, we put a stop to it. We eliminated critical race theory from our K through 12 schools. We prohibited the use of gender ideology in our schools, particularly in the elementary schools. And yes, we had to stand up to the media on that, we had to stand up to the left on that, we even had to stand up to a company in Central Florida that's pretty well known that you guys know about here in Southern California called Disney. But you know, it's wrong to tell a second grader that their gender is a choice. It's not true, and it's inappropriate. And we will stand up when it's tough. When the media is bearing down on us, I will stand up. When the left is bearing down on us, I will stand up. When the most powerful company in the history of Florida is bearing down on us, I will stand up because it is the right thing to do to stand up for the well being of our kids. And I will do battle with anybody that seeks to rob them of their innocence.
You want to talk about crime? We see crime -- just since Casey and I have been in Southern California, we've run into like six or seven people that have gotten mugged. And they're telling the stories about getting mugged because people in California, these district attorneys in San Francisco and Los Angeles, they get elected usually with funding from people like George Soros, and they decide that they are progressive, and they don't agree with all the laws passed. And so they let the inmates run the asylum. And it puts the people of their communities at risk. crime goes up, and the quality of life becomes destroyed. In Florida, when we had two prosecutors, Tampa and Orlando, that got elected with Soros funding, they said or did not enforce the law as they took an oath to do, I didn't talk about it. I removed them from their posts. They are gone.
When BLM were was ransacking cities in the summer of 2020, I wasn't just sending social media messages saying law and order, I ensured law and order in the state of Florida. We called up the National Guard. We had state law enforcement ready. We were not going to let cities burned down in the state of Florida. And you know what? They didn't burn down in the state of Florida. And that's what should be done nationwide.
We rejected the idea that we would attack police or defund the men and women in law enforcement. In fact, not only did we not defund, we now gave -- we give $5,000 signing bonuses to any police officer who we recruit from out of state. I was talking to a police chief in Southern California, I asked him how are things going. He's like, they're going good, but all my police officers want to move to your state. Well, that's because they're treated well. And guess what? Florida's crime rate is not like LA or San Francisco or Chicago; Florida's crime rates at a 50-year low. That's what you call taking care of business.
We talk about things like the Communist Party of China in the debate the other night. We didn't just talk about it in Florida, we're the only state, I think in America, we have banned the purchase of land by the Chinese Communist Party in the state of Florida. We need to do that nationwide.
We sometimes talk about things like the ESG movement, which is trying to take over our economy. Asset managers at places like Blackrock want to use your money, want to use pension money from teachers and police officers to be able to advance their ideological agenda. We didn't just complain about it in Florida, we kneecapped ESG in Florida. We banned ESG from our pension funds. I took $2 billion away from Blackrock who had managed $2 billion in our pension funds. That's gone. We eliminated the use of social credit scores and financing. And we told the credit rating agencies, you can't use ESG criteria in rating our municipal bonds. And guess what? ESG is now on the defense because of what Florida is doing. That is what you call action. That is what you call getting results.
And oh, by the way, they're now talking in DC with the Federal Reserve about imposing a central bank digital currency. We're on offense on that too. First of all, central bank digital currency, what they want to do is eliminate cash, eliminate crypto currency, and make this central bank digital dollar the sole way that you can participate in the economy. Why would they want to do that? Are they just trying to be friends with you? Are they just trying to make your life a little easier? No, they want to be able to control, they want to be able to impose a social credit score, social credit system on there. And you've got guys at places like the World Economic Forum that are bragging about how it would allow them to target disfavored purchases because they don't want you purchasing firearms. They don't want you purchasing a lot of gasoline. They want to be able to have the means to shut you off.
So there's things that government will do that they'll dress up in benevolent ways that's kind of like a wolf in sheep's clothing. Central Bank Digital Currency is not that. It's a wolf showing up as a wolf. They're coming after your freedom. And so, in the state of Florida, we told that, we saw what the Fed's thinking about doing, so we passed legislation banning the use of central bank digital currency in the state of Florida, we're not going to let them get a foothold, and we're not going to let them take away your financial privacy.
We talk about having an equal opportunity society where people aren't divvied up into different racial groups. But we're the first state to actually eliminate so called DEI, from our public universities. We're not going to treat people and shoehorn them into different ethnic groups, we're going to treat people as individuals, we're going to treat them based on merit. And this whole DEI, they say it's diversity, equity and inclusion, the way it's practice, it's discrimination, exclusion and indoctrination and has no place in our public universities.
So on on issue after issue, we don't chirp, we don't virtue signal, we act and we deliver. And you want to know why Florida has gone from being a state that was determined by one point to now being a state where a guy like me could win the greatest Republican governor victory in the history of the state winning by 20 points. It's because people respond to leadership. It's because we've had people that have moved from other states, because they support the values that we represent. But even more importantly, we have people in places like Miami, who used to be Democrats used to be independents, who have now switched to become Republicans because of what we've done. In fact, in my election in November, Miami Dade County is our most populous county, 2.8 million people. And in 2016, Hillary Clinton won that county by 30 percentage points. It was a big time blue County. I want it by double digits in November. So this can happen and that's what we need to do.
So the question is, is how do we move forward nationally as a party because the Florida success story, I can point you to a couple other examples in the country where we've had strong Republican leadership, Iowa, for example, under Governor Reynolds, Georgia, Texas, there have been some good ones, don't get me wrong. But our party's lost more than it's won over these last three election cycles. And the Democrats are cleaning our clock in Washington, and in so many other areas. And so we need to try a different way going forward, we need to try a way that you're going to actually be able to win a big victory. But then more important than that, everything you say you're going to do, you got to get up there on day one, you got to be ready to go, you got to be focused, you got to be discipline, you got to know it's not about you. It's about achieving the larger goal, and you got to get to work and you can't stop and you need to do it for two terms to make sure it all sticks. When I was at President Reagan's library, one of the things I think was remarkable is he's really the last president we've had that served, yes, he served for two terms, but his legacy has extended way, way beyond those two terms. His achievements, really marked 20, 25 years of this country and some of the things that we were able to accomplish. That's what you get when you have somebody that can serve to strong terms to be able to turn the country around. So what does that look like? I was, in getting ready for this debate, I started looking at some of the President Reagan's speeches and some of his writings. Just to kind of get myself in the frame of mind. I actually thought they may ask a question about Reagan's legacy. They didn't they were asking, I don't know what they were asking, but that's okay. You know, you wrote you, you know, I just roll with the punches. I'm there, I'll handle whatever they throw at me. But so I started doing it. And I read his farewell address. And he talked about a lot of the things that they were able to accomplish. Of course, he was on the brink, which we may not have known right at that time, but he was on the brink of seeing the Berlin wall fall down later that year in 1989. And really marking probably the greatest achievement that a president has had in the last 50 years, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the Berlin Wall. So he's reflecting on the successes, reflecting on that. And it occurred to me that that's a great way to think about a campaign right now going forward. What do I want to be able to say to you looking into the camera in January of the year 2033, after serving two terms, and being able to address the people on my way out the door, hopefully handing it off to a worthy successor. And I think what I would want to say is a number of things. One, we will be able to say that we have restored the American dream in this country. People that work hard can get ahead again, government is going to get off your back. We're not going to let the bureaucrats run our society, we're not going to let the left politicize our economy and deny you the chance to make the most of your God given ability. We will also be able to say that our country has reclaimed and restored its national sovereignty because we will have a border that is airtight, that is secure, and is not allowing Mexican drug cartels to poison people throughout this fruited plain. And this is not something, look addiction is a tough thing. We've actually in Florida have a program, we're the only state in the country, I believe in the last year that seen a decline in overdose deaths because of how we've tried to go and help people. But the thing about the fentanyl is, it's getting people who are not addicted to drugs, who maybe try one pill at one point in time, and if that pill is laced with fentanyl, that could be the end of their lives. And there's mothers across this country, not just in border towns who have lost kids, because what is going on. One of the reasons we'll have our sovereignty restored is yes, I will change the policy, we're not going to let people in. Yes, I will do the border wall because I think it's important. But I will be willing to use my powers as commander in chief to use deadly force against the Mexican drug cartels, they're killing our people, it's time we leave them stone cold dead at the border. We'll also be able to say that our country remains the world's leading superpower, that our military is strong, and that we will have successfully fended off the threat posed by Communist China. This decade is going to be decisive and to how we navigate that confrontation. Under current course, under President Biden, we are probably going to end up getting in a war with China that we would lose. That's not going to happen when I'm president. And we'll be able to look back eight years hence saying we did it right. We'll also be able to say that the school systems in this country are dedicated to educating our kids and no longer indoctrinating our kids.
We'll be able to say that the rights of parents are universally respected throughout this country. We're not going to have things like in California, where they're going after the rights of parents, even tried to pass a bill recently, to take away custody of a kid from a parent, if the parent did not indulge transgenderism with the kid. So you see the direction society is going, we will stop that we will reverse and we will make sure that parents are empowered. And as part of having a good education system, we will have an emphasis that each and every student understands the founding principles of this country is taught to appreciate the Constitution and as a great grasp of what it means to be an American. Because we've had so many people that have fought hard for us.
We will also be able to look back and say that from coast to coast, we are a country where criminals are held responsible for their misconduct and that the inmates are no longer running the asylum. And that's from the most conservative city to the most liberal city, everywhere is going to have law and order and people will be safer as a result.
And then finally, we'll be able to say that together we restored the original understanding of our Constitution. We will have a limited government that works alongside us. We will not have an unaccountable bureaucracy that's been weaponized against us. I look at these agencies like the Department of Justice, like the FBI, like the IRS. You know, we have a government, they can't tell you how many tanks they left in Afghanistan. They can't tell you where the money they've sent to Ukraine has gone they can't tell you how many people are coming across our border illegally. I can't even tell you how cocaine got into the White House. But yet if you make a $601 transaction, the IRS is going to be on your case and they are going to be policing you. That is unacceptable. We will have restored this government to its rightful owners, we the American people.
And we have no choice but to make sure we get all this done. My wife and I, and my wife is here the First Lady of Florida, many of you got to meet her. She is, I'm a little biased, but I do think this is true of all 50 states, she's America's greatest First Lady, and we appreciate everything that she does. So we have at home, we have a six, five, and three year old. And so first grade, kindergarten, and pre k three. So we're very sensitive about what's going to happen in this next generation, because it's going to impact them, it's going to impact some of your kids, your grandkids. And we run the risk on our current course, being the first generation of Americans that are leaving to our children and grandchildren an America that's less prosperous, and less free than the one we inherited. And that would not be doing justice to our kids and grandkids, we will not have been doing our part as Americans, and I'm motivated to get in the fight because of that reality, but I'm also motivated, because I have an appreciation for the people that have come before us. When I used to fly up to Washington DC, there was a particular route that the plane could take, going into Reagan National Airport, and it will take you flush parallel to the National Mall. So if you looked out the left side of the plane, you saw sweeping up close views of the Lincoln Memorial, the reflecting pool, Washington Monument, all the other monuments, and then perched on top of the hill, in the not too distant yonder, the beautiful US Capitol building. And you think to yourself, you know, all that stuff really symbolizes the principles and the ideals that make our country unique and it fills you with a sense of pride of being an American. And I can tell you, a lot of the tourists would really get excited about it. And so it made you feel good. But what I noticed after doing that a few times, was looking out the left side of the plane, while those monuments were spectacular, while those monuments, were nice to see, those were not the greatest monuments to our country, because if you looked out the right side of the plane, you looked over the Potomac River, you saw a lot of small nondescript monuments orderly arranged over the rolling hills of a place called Arlington National Cemetery. And it occurred to me then, and I believe now, you can have the best constitution in the world, you can have the best Declaration of Independence in the world, these things do not run on autopilot. They require each generation of Americans when tested, to step up and to defend freedom. And yes, in certain instances, to put on a uniform, to risk your life and indeed give that last full measure of devotion in service to the greater cause. We are not doing justice to their sacrifices and their memories. If we allow this country to continue its descent, we have responsibility to step up, we have responsibility to fight back. And we have responsibility to reverse this country's decline and give this country a new birth of freedom. So now's the time to do it. The time for excuses is over, we are not going to get a mulligan on the 2024 election. I don't want to be in a situation where it's recriminations and the Democrats get in again, and they end up doing even greater damage. Just think about the damage they have done, when they had 50 senators and 2021, barely had a majority in the House and they were able to do all this damage. Yet when we have majorities. Republicans don't do squat with the majorities. How do we keep letting this happen?
So we all got to do our part. And here's the thing, the way our society functions now is, when you stand up for what's right, when you're exercising leadership, you could be a governor, you could be a presidential candidate, you could be running for city council, you could just be a concerned citizen, you could be a mom going to school board meeting, if you're standing up for what's right and you're exercising leadership that is not cost free. People will come after you. The left will come after you. The media will come after you. I'm actually a little disappointed. I didn't see any protesters out for me today. Where did the protesters go? We had them six months ago when I was here. I had them in other parts of California since I've been here. But they will come after you. And so the question is, you know, it's always easier just kind of retreat back and your little safety comfort zone, to not want to get out there, to not have to put up with it. Because it can be nasty. It can be tough. But you know, if people were willing to put on a uniform and give their life for us in years past, that is the least we can do, to step up and fight back when freedom is under attack.
Let's resolve to take the next year, year and a half to ensure that in every corner of this country, we are bringing a message of hope. We are bringing a message of renewal and we are bringing a message of freedom to every citizen in every jurisdiction in this land and I don't care if it's someplace that is dark red, like we've made most of Florida or if it's in the heart of sand Francisco, we have got to carry the message and we've got to do what's right. So I can just tell you this. I'm not backing down. We've got a country to save. Let's get the job done. God bless you all. And thank you so much. We appreciate you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much. November 30, we'll see the debate. Thank you. Thanks so much.

"Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: GOP Candidates Must Protect Life, Debate Stage Opportunity For Contrast On The Issue",2023-09-29T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-gop-candidates-must-protect-life-debate-stage,"
ANAHEIM, CA –  Today, Tim Scott joined FOX News' Neil Cavuto to discuss his debate performance from earlier this week and reaffirm his commitment to protecting life. Earlier this week, Tim won the GOP presidential debate and was able to get other candidates to clarify their positions on life.
WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: Well, the debate stage is where we have an opportunity to lay out our vision for our future in this nation. The debate stage is a place where, just this last debate, I asked a question about the 15-week limit and Ron changed his position. He said he would now support a 15-week limit. That's, frankly, a good position to take. I wish we had more candidates, Vivek and Nikki, please join the 15-week limit. Let's stop radical states like California, Illinois, and New York from having abortion on demand.
Neil Cavuto:  In other words don't go to smaller, more limited. No, I wanna be clear. You don't believe it should be at six weeks or any smaller period than that. To go around that 15-week period was the wise route?
Tim Scott: Yeah, so the states have the opportunity to preserve life at a lower level. Nationally, we should have a 15-week limit to stop the radical states from having abortion up until the day of birth.

GOV DESANTIS: Laughing on both sides of the aisle, too, so it was good. And, welcome back to the show. I know you guys were on hiatus for a while.
MAHER: Oh, thank you.
GOV DESANTIS: I do got to put in a plug, like, if you ever have problems in California, you know in Florida, not only do we have no income tax, no vaccine mandates allowed in the state of Florida.
MAHER: We're going to get to that. We're going to get to that. I know, but people do wear cowboy boots with a suit. So, I'm not going to Florida. That's just a crazy thing to do.
GOV DESANTIS: We're proud of it. We're proud of it.
MAHER: But there were no cowboys in Florida, Ron.
GOV DESANTIS: You should try Florida. We're one of the top cattle states in America. Once you go from the beach, you go to the interior of Florida, nothing but cattle ranches.
MAHER: Oh, all right. Well, I stand corrected. Because I'm wearing orthopedic shoes.
GOV DESANTIS: There you go.
MAHER: Okay, so the debate, it was a shitshow. But I -- Right? I mean, even you said you wouldn't have -- you would have turned it off if you were watching. I mean people screaming over each other, I couldn't hear what anyone was saying. It was terrible. But I heard you won. I heard the polling said you won. What did you win? Honestly, with Trump not in the race, what did you win?
GOV DESANTIS: Well, but I think that, you know, he's not showing up. He's missing an action. He owes it to voters to show up and defend his record. And I think he thinks he can take a juice poll, and then people don't get to vote. That's not the way the system works. You got to go earn votes. So I'm showing up; I'm showing that -- and that's, here's the thing. In the midst of all the show that happened, I was the one guy that people said, you know what, this guy is actually acting like a president when the rest were not. And so okay, there I am. I told Donald, let's do a debate. I'm debating your Governor Gavin Newsom --
MAHER: We're going to get to that.
GOV DESANTIS: -- But let's do a debate with me and him. I'll do it.
MAHER: Alright. But there's -- can I ask you one thing about these debates? Can you get rid of this guy Doug Burgum? This guy -- this bugs me. He is not going to be president. This guy could start dating Taylor Swift and nobody would care. North Dakota is not even a state. Alright. But you know, the thing is, you did not take my advice.
GOV DESANTIS: What was it?
MAHER: I was on the show. A few times we talked, I said, this guy's crazy to run this time. He's splitting 45 years old. You just had a birthday, right? That -- you could run for the next 20 years. If you were Biden, the next 40. Okay, why run against Trump? You're trying to thread this needle that will never happen.
GOV DESANTIS: Well, there's a couple reasons --
MAHER: You can't disavow him because you -- that's the base, and yet you're running against him. And that's why, I mean, let's face it. If this campaign was going well, you wouldn't be on this show.
GOV DESANTIS: Oh, that's not true. So, one, I don't think he can win the election. I could win the election. Two, I don't think he could actually get the job done that we need to do. For example: COVID. I think we need accountability for what this government did to this country with the COVID restrictions, mandates, and lockdowns. Donald Trump is not going to do that. He says he did everything right. He says he saved millions of lives with lockdowns. He claims his MNRA shot saved 100 million lives. He's not going to clean house at CDC, NIH, FDA, or any of that. I will do that. I will get the job done. And a lot of other things we'd do. The one thing about me in Florida even like critics will acknowledge, if he says he's going to do something, he will follow through and get the job done. So it's about the country. Are we going to get the country turned around or not? I don't think he's a vehicle that's doing. And I have been -- when I supported him on the things I like, I've said it, but I've been critical about the things that he didn't do. And I'll continue to do that.
MAHER: Okay, but -- but you campaigned for election deniers in 2022. This I do not forgive.
GOV DESANTIS: Well look --
MAHER: To quote the Godfather. I mean, Kari Lake, who said Biden's an illegitimate President. Trump didn't --
GOV DESANTIS: Well now she's attacking me, so maybe I did make a mistake there because she's out there saying -- she's trying to say that we mandated vax in Florida. We did the opposite. We protected people, even from private mandates, so that may have been --
MAHER: But Trump lost the election, right?
GOV DESANTIS: Yes.
MAHER: Okay, so why did you campaign for people who said he didn't?
GOV DESANTIS: Because I wanted to see Republicans win key races, and I said --
MAHER: That's not a deal breaker issue for you? That's not democracy?
GOV DESANTIS: Okay, well, let's go back to 2016. Your friends in Hollywood were cutting ads telling the Electoral College to vote against Trump in the Electoral College because it was stolen. They said Russia stole the election; for years they said that, so don't act like this is like a unique thing in modern history of the country.
MAHER: First of all, Ron, I have no friends in Hollywood.
GOV DESANTIS: You do remember the commercials, though? I remember them.
MAHER: Okay. I mean, the thing that you seemed to stake your campaign on is where woke goes to die. You said that's where -- and look, I'm fed up with woke too. That's why I have trouble with friends in Hollywood. I'm an old school liberal, and that's a whole different thing than woke. And I'm sympathetic to you because, you know, you very often, like, take on an issue where I feel like, yeah, there is crazy stuff going on in schools. There is crazy stuff. But the problem is, it doesn't resonate with a lot of people who don't see it, for whatever reason. And so they're like, why is this guy picking a fight with Mickey? Right?
GOV DESANTIS: Well, they picked the fight with us. But, well, listen. So first of all, I do a lot more than just that. I think that's a little bit of a caricature. But this idea of ideology corrupting institutions, I see it in Los Angeles with the amount of crime that's here and the homelessness. There are people that commit crimes who are not prosecuted like they would be in Florida. Our state's crime rate is at a 50-year low. You elect these people like Gascon and what they did in San Francisco. You can break into somebody's house or mug somebody, and you don't end up going to jail? That doesn't work but that's driven by ideology. So it's not just we're having just a philosophical debate. I think woke ideology has corrupted institutions. I think it's corrupted things like the CDC with how they handled COVID with the nonsense that they did. So it's a broader issue than just a philosophical fight.
MAHER: You keep wanting to get back to that. And I don't blame you because you're right. We're on the same page there. And I think it's unfair what they did to you because you did handle it better. You did handle it better. You were right. You were like, let's target the people, protect the people, who are most vulnerable, and everybody else can go on with their lives a little better. You opened schools sooner. And a lot of the stuff that's come in, the information we have after now we've had a few years to look at it, you were more right, and they won't give you credit with it. The New York Times --
GOV DESANTIS: Well, it's not about credit for me, though. It's not about credit for me. It's about --
MAHER: Well, okay, but --
GOV DESANTIS: It's about them admitting that they were wrong.
MAHER: Right.
GOV DESANTIS: They are setting us up --
MAHER: Right.
GOV DESANTIS: -- if this happened again, they would repeat the same playbook all over again. And if we don't have accountability, that's what's going to happen. So I'll bring accountability, so it never happens in our country again.
MAHER: I saw the New York Times with such a despicable hit piece on you that I saw, because -- I forget what the lead headline was, but it was basically Ron DeSantis fucked up the pandemic. And then like, at the very end, it says Florida's death rate, overall, is better than the national average. And if you're going to do an article -- If you're going to do an article about Florida and the pandemic, shouldn't that be the lead? Shouldn't that be the head--I mean, talk about bury the lead.
GOV DESANTIS: Shouldn't it be that we're the number one state for in-migration? I mean, if we did so bad, people would have been leaving Florida. People are coming, wealth's moving into the state, our economy's done better than any other large state, and education -- we're now ranked, I think, in the top five on most metrics in education. Now, that wasn't true when I was a kid growing up in Florida. So we did it right, but what we did is we understood, you can't stop society because of one respiratory virus. That's not even the way to help health overall.
MAHER: Well, you could if it was bad enough, but not that.
GOV DESANTIS: Right. Well, they were wrong on the death rate, they were wrong on closures, they were wrong on everything. And yet, we act like, what, we're just going to shrug our shoulders and move along?
MAHER: So, that's the part of you I like. And then there's the part of you, like, you're going after -- I mean your state voted to restore voting rights for felons. And then through some political bullshit ju-jitsu, that got undone. Now you're like --
GOV DESANTIS: No, that's not true.
MAHER: It's true.
GOV DESANTIS: No, no.
MAHER: And you're going after people now. I mean, you some --
GOV DESANTIS: They didn't qualify though. So that amendment did not include murderers and sex offenders. So we had sex offenders, convicted sex offenders, who voted who were not eligible under that amendment, so we held them accountable. That was absolutely consistent with the law.
MAHER: Yeah, but there really isn't in-person voter fraud. Like 11 million people voted in Florida, and I think you found 41 people. I mean, that's --
GOV DESANTIS: Right, but if you have somebody that's illegally in the country, and they vote, should they be held accountable or not? I think they should be held accountable.
MAHER: I mean, that's .00000 --
GOV DESANTIS: In a statewide race, but we've had local elections decided by 15, 20, 30 votes in the last few years. And so, I think we want legal people to vote. You know, if you're not a citizen of this country, you should not be voting in American elections.
MAHER: Okay, but that's not the biggest issue we have. Is it? I mean --
GOV DESANTIS: No one's saying it's the biggest. We've taken on all kinds of issues in Florida.
MAHER: It looks like you're just trying to stop black people from voting.
GOV DESANTIS: Oh, that's nonsense.
MAHER: It looks -- I don't think it's nonsense. Black folks don't vote for the Republican Party in very big numbers.
GOV DESANTIS: But I got a bigger percentage than other Republicans have gotten when I ran for reelection.
MAHER: Whoop die doo. That's not a -- I wouldn't brag about that.
GOV DESANTIS: We're making progress, man.
MAHER: And then the abortion ban -- a six-week abortion ban. I don't get that either because six weeks, like, if you're -- I know you say it's a case of conviction. If it's conviction, wouldn't it be moment of conception? That's what conviction is to me. Like, if you believe the second, you know, before the guy can get the towel, there's a third person in that room?
GOV DESANTIS: Well, no, I mean, it's a legislative issue. So they have to figure out what they think. And so, the legislature identified the moment where there's a detectable heartbeat as the time where there's legal protections. Now, they did provide exceptions for all the difficult cases that you hear about, but basically, once there's a heartbeat, it shouldn't be used as a form of birth control.
MAHER: Okay, so you're going to debate Newsom.
GOV DESANTIS: We are.
MAHER: You know he's taller and better looking. Good luck. Thank you for being here. Governor Ron DeSantis, everybody.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis Stands with California Truckers at LA Harbor Grain Terminal,2023-09-29T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-stands-with-california-truckers-la,"
""I want to just give my support to the truckers and the trucking industry… A lot of times, people don't appreciate how integral these truckers are to our standard of living and our way of life.""
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today held a campaign event at the LA Harbor Grain Terminal in Long Beach, California to condemn Joe Biden and Gavin Newsom's Green New Deal policies. During his press conference, DeSantis also reiterated his call for Donald Trump to debate him one-on-one.
Watch the full remarks HERE.
On the importance of supporting truckers:
I want to just give my support to the truckers and the trucking industry. It's something that's very important to us in Florida. When I became governor, we had about 600 truckers that we would produce through our training programs every year. Now, through a lot of the investments we've made, we're producing 3,500 new truckers every year in the state of Florida. That is important for the economy, you doing your daily thing, a lot of times people don't appreciate how integral these truckers are to our standard of living and our way of life.
On the effects of California's leftist policies:
I think it'll be an interesting debate when we have on November 30, the debate between me and your governor here in California. I think it'd be instructive, not necessarily about which states better because I think people have voted with their feet on that, but as I see the things that are being done in California, this is basically the petri dish for Leftism in this country. So whatever Biden's doing, he's a few years behind what they're doing here in California. So I think the things that are doing like this diesel truck mandate, EVs, all that that is absolutely going to be done nationally. And I know they're working together on that. So it's really about future of the country. I think the country's going into a state of decline now. We need to reverse that decline. And the success we've had in Florida shows a model for American revival. And that's exactly why I'm running for president.
On Biden's reckless electric vehicle mandates:
We are going to reverse the Biden mandates for electric vehicles. We are going to save the American automobile. You should be able to purchase the car that is best for you and your family, you shouldn't have Washington, DC or the state of California telling you that you can only buy the type of car that they want you to buy. They say that this is somehow better for the environment to force electric vehicles, but I can tell you, one thing is, is the things that go into making these come from communist China. I don't see how it's better to rely on China for anything.
On debating Donald Trump one-on-one:
I'm somebody that's proven to not only get in these big fights, to win these fights, and then to deliver strong electoral victories, I could serve for two terms. I don't think a lame duck president is going to cut it, because we know there's so much that needs to be done. So, he needs to come, and he needs to defend his record. I remember going to his rallies in 2016, a lot of the things he said then, draining the swamp, Mexico paying for the border wall, eliminating the national debt, all these things he didn't do, and now he's running on a lot of the same promises he made back then. I think he owes it to come out and debate. I offered us and Sean Hannity is doing the debate between me and your governor here in California. I told Sean let's do one between me and Donald Trump on Hannity. I'm happy to do that. I think he should show up to the normal debates but if not, you know we'll do it, but let's go. He's had a lot to say about me on social media over the last nine months, well now we can get up there and we can make this case in-person.
On restoring the American dream:
You have people that are imposing policies in Washington that are making you pay the bill. They're not paying the bill for it; they just keep doing it. And this is behavior that really started with the COVID lockdowns in 2020, the trillions of dollars that were spent, of course, that's going to cause inflation. And that's both parties, Republicans and Democrats that have had a hand in that. And this is making it very, very difficult for people. And if we as a country, if you can't work hard and succeed, raise families, and realize the American dream. If it doesn't work for people that are doing everything right, this country is not going to succeed. And so, we need to fix that. And my goal as president, what I pledge to do as president is to restore that American Dream for people all throughout this country.
On the hardship Bidenomics has caused for American families:
Right now, grocery costs are probably double than what they were just four or five years ago. Things that we used to take for granted, are now becoming out of reach. And these are people, you're working hard, you're just trying to raise families and you get stuck with these big bills... Buying a new home with interest rates at 8%? Good luck with that. Our housing market is in big trouble because of that. Even purchasing new cars, the price of cars is up 70% in the last four or five years; these mandates are going to make those costs go up even more.
On Florida's universal school choice:
You want to talk about things like education, we have universal school choice in Florida. Every parent has a right to take a scholarship to a private school, they can go to a charter school and even within the school districts, they have choices to be able to go. On issue after issue, I've delivered where these other candidates have just talked. And I think it's very clear, as you look in these early states, where this stands. So, we're going to be that candidate built for the long haul, we're going to get the job done, starting in the early states, and we'll be able to bring this to a conclusion.
On bringing the border crisis to an end:
So everyone that has come illegally under Biden, we got to go -- they're sending back. So that's going to be the first priority. That's probably six or seven million people right there. It's going to require a lot of effort, it's going to require us to lean in, but if you don't have a sanction for violating the law -- I support building a wall, I support all this -- you're going to continue to have it. I would note that the former president is campaigning on the same promise he made in '16 that he didn't deliver on. In fact, Obama's first term there were more deportations than under Trump's term in office. Now he's saying he's going to do this great thing. He had for years and didn't get the job done. You know, we're going to get the job done. But I definitely think the people that are coming over -- kind of last one in, first one out, and we're going to really push forward strongly on that.

""WINNERS"":
Tim Scott: The South Carolina senator was much more forceful than in the first debate, delivering a body-blow attack line against rival Vivek Ramaswamy by accusing the entrepreneur of being ""in business with the Chinese Communist Party."" He also got in one of the first applause lines of the night when asked about President Biden joining striking autoworkers on the picket line this week.""

""WINNERS"":
Scott later singled out Ramaswamy for saying during the first debate he was ""the only person on the stage who isn't bought and paid for,"" alleging he was ""in business"" with the Chinese Community Party and the same people who funded Hunter Biden.""
Trace Gallagher: ""The response from the crowd was Tim Scott brought his energy. He brought his game tonight.""
Garrett Haake: ""We did see a much more aggressive Scott challenging Ramaswamy, challenging some of these other candidates to try to create opportunities for himself to better introduce himself.""
Wall Street Journal: ""Well, they had their moments. Tim Scott finally cut through the disorderly debate with remarks on race and America's promise.""
Larry Kudlow: ""Tim Scott I have to give him a lot of credit because he did this riff on Blacks, African Americans, somehow surviving through slavery and then went on to say that the Great Society of LBJ and all the democratic presidents since then have made the black situation worse, not better. Breaking up the black family... I just have to give him credit on that.""
Sean Hannity: ""He's an inspiring speaker.""
Lanhee Chen: ""Tim Scott stood out...I think people will see him as someone who wanted to come out and make some points and I think he did.""

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Bill Hemmer on Fox News' America's Newsroom. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On calling out Trump for being Missing in Action:
[Trump's] Missing in Action, Bill. This is something you have to earn. Nobody is entitled to this. You know, I remember back in 2020, I had a big party in Tallahassee for that first debate that Trump did with Biden. And the reality is Biden beat Trump in that debate, and I don't know how you could lose the Biden in a debate, but that happened. And so we're in a situation now where we're not getting a mulligan on the 2024 election. We've had three election cycles in a row as Republicans where we've underperformed. Not in Florida, we set the standard in Florida, we have got to get this right. We see the country's in decline, we can't just be content with managing this decline, we've got to reverse it. We need an American revival. I think what we've shown in Florida is that it is possible to do. President Reagan was somebody when he came in, because we were in his library, people said it couldn't be done. We're in an era of limits, that the Carter performance was basically optimal at that point for America. Ronald Reagan rejected that. And I'm rejecting that here right now, and I have the ability to get the job done.
So he owes it to the voters to defend his record, to defend the decisions he's made. And also to defend why is he running on the same program in 2016, that he did not actually implement. For example, draining the swamp. He didn't fire Christopher Wray, he didn't fire Anthony Fauci. He didn't do anything to clean house. Now all of a sudden, he's going to slay the administrative state when he gave Fauci an award his last day in office? What about all the spending and debt. They racked up massive amounts of debt, particularly in his last year in office, of course, you're going to end up leading to inflation when you do that. So I think on a issue after issue, he owes it to the voters to come out and do it. And I'd say the final thing, Bill, he's had a lot to say about me on social media, really since 2022, right before the midterm election, he started attacking me when all Republicans were supposed to be united for a red wave. No, he tried to attack me, and he's been doing it a lot. You know, it's one thing to do it behind a keyboard. Step up on stage, and do it to my face. I'm ready for it. He used to say I was a great governor. Now all of a sudden, you're saying the opposite? Let's have that discussion. And I'll do it. We could do one on one. I was with Sean last night. Let's do that and let's give the American people the choice that they deserve.
On his military service:
Now my view on running is I want to tell you what I'm going to do for you. But when you're in a presidential situation, people kind of want to know what drives you and you know, I just pointed out I was a blue-collar kid working minimum wage jobs. I ended up getting degrees from Yale and Harvard Law School, coming out more conservative than when I went. I had a lot of opportunities to do very well financially. And coming from blue-collar roots, I think most people would have took that, but I felt the obligation to serve. I left a lot of money on the table, but being able to wear the uniform volunteering to go to Iraq. It's an important part of who I am. And I think as Commander in Chief, it will inform my judgments about how to do it. And then it was just interesting being back in California, where that was where we had deployed from, and that's where we came back. And it brought back a lot of old memories. We actually did an event on Sunday night at the VFW in Coronado. So we had a lot of great veterans and people are appreciative to have a veteran running for office.
On his approach to national security:
A lot of those Republicans, they're making the point of 'how do you do that while ignoring these massive problems here at home?' So for example, with our own southern border, and I also think an issue that was kind of raised last night we didn't get to flush out is Biden's policy is basically Europe First. He is not doing what he needs to do to deter China in the Indo-Pacific, he will say, and some of the people on the stage will say that the way you deter China is to continue Ukraine indefinitely, basically a blank check. I actually think China would benefit from a multi year quagmire, I think we need to bring that war in Europe to a conclusion. But we have to do more in the Indo Pacific, we don't have adequate hard power, so if somebody like Xi Jinping is looking at a Taiwan amphibious invasion, he's going to calculate what the resistance is. And if we have a strategy of denying him an ability to do that, successful deterrence strategy, that is going to make all the difference over the course of the next decade.
So my approach to national security is going to be take the China threat as the preeminent threat, make sure we're doing what we need to do to deter them in Asia, and then work with the European allies to get a sustainable peace in Europe. But they should be doing more than they have done. We have done an awful lot. And that's just the reality. But how do you leave your own border wide open? You know, there are Russians coming in, across the southern border right now, they are Iranians, Chinese, coming across the southern border, but they have to deal with their own country first. We have to I think what Americans are frustrated with is you have a ruling elite in DC that constantly ignore their concerns, and the things that they care about. And I think this border issue is one of those where they don't care about that but they're willing to hotline stuff all across the world. And so let's make sure we're taking care of our own folks first. And as President on day one, we will get the border, it'll be a front burner issue, and people are not going to have to worry about my commitment to that.
On the House's impeachment inquiry hearing:
This family is potentially the most corrupt presidential family in history. Joe Biden's already lied about the business dealings, we know that, we now see a quarter of a million dollars go into Biden's address from China. So this stinks to high heaven. They're right to do it and I support it. I would also point out that, you know, you talk about things like impeachment, one of the things is just violating your oath of office and I look at what's happening at the southern border, he took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, make sure that the laws are faithfully executed, and he has absolutely defaulted on that obligation. And we see the carnage that's happened. So I think there's a whole host of things to look at, but certainly this corruption is real. And they need to produce the goods of course, but where there's smoke, there's fire. And here's the thing, if all this was on the up and up, I don't think he would have been lying about it for all these years.

Burgum Campaign Press Release - Media Debate Reaction: Burgum Fights His Way In,2023-09-28T00:00:00+00:00,Doug Burgum,/documents/burgum-campaign-press-release-media-debate-reaction-burgum-fights-his-way,"
Media Highlights and Reaction to the Second GOP Debate.
InForum: McFeeley: Burgum Gets His Moment
Burgum had reason to be upset when other candidates were given questions about technology and oil — two areas in which the billionaire former software executive and current governor of an oil-rich state is a bonafide expert — and the moderators ignored him in favor of Ramaswamy, Haley and Scott.
Burgum had the closest thing he's had to a memorable moment late in the evening when he forced his way into the conversation and claimed he's the only candidate actually doing what others are talking about, like drilling for more oil and sending troops to America's southern border.
""We're fighting the Biden administration on 20 fronts (in North Dakota),"" Burgum said, actually looking angry. ""To say that nobody's fighting the big fights ... just look at the record of what we're doing right now. Energy, economy, national security. We've been talking about it since day one. And now finally, good, we're having a conversation about it. But we've got the answer in North Dakota.""
Varney, seemingly impressed by Burgum's fire, gave the governor the next question: How would you shrink big government? Burgum pointed to his experience in North Dakota.
""When I took office, we shrunk the state budget general fund by 27% in the first four months I was in office and all the trains kept running on time. Why? Because you had a business leader that was actually there,"" Burgum said, still fiery from his previous answer.
""Inside of every government job there's 10% or 20% of mind-numbing, soul-sucking work that even state and federal employees don't want to do. You can engineer that work out of the job. That would free up right there 20% of 2 million civilian employees. And by the way, we have 10 million jobs open so they'd have plenty to do. They'd be generating taxes instead of being paid by taxes. ""This is totally possible to do if you have somebody that understands. Having worked in technology for 30 years, everything we had to was be better, faster and cheaper the next day. That's what we can do in government. That's what we're doing in North Dakota.""
InForum: Pugnacious Doug Burgum forces himself into debate conversation
The Fox Business moderators didn't seem much interested in hearing from North Dakota's governor during the GOP's 2nd presidential debate, but he made himself heard anyway.
…At 82 minutes in, Burgum was tossed his fourth question by Dana Perino, who made it clear that the farm-state guy was getting the agriculture question. It was patronizing, but Burgum turned the question about the nation's agriculture industry's well-being back to the central themes of his campaign. ""We're in a cold war with China. The Biden administration won't admit that,"" he said. It's about national security, too. ""We get attacked every day...by either China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea,"" he said, referring to cyberwarfare. It's also about energy. ""China imports 10 million barrels a day. We have had four cabinet members visit China, and not one of them has talked about energy,"" Burgum said. ""It's not climate change we need to talk about. It's actually Biden's climate policies that are the existential threat.""
…By my count, Burgum was directly asked questions just four times all night. He successfully forced his way into the conversation three other times. According to a live analysis by the New York Times, Burgum spoke for just 7 minutes and 35 seconds, significantly less than any of the other candidates. And that's a shame. Burgum clearly has good answers.

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Ron DeSantis on Challenging Trump to a Debate: ""Let's do it, right?""",2023-09-27T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-ron-desantis-challenging-trump-debate-lets-do-it-right,"
""He owes it to our voters to come and make the case."" 
SIMI VALLEY, CA - Ron DeSantis today joined Sean Hannity live following the second GOP primary debate. The highlights are below.
Watch HERE.
On debating Donald Trump:
DESANTIS: You know what, maybe we can say, since the former president didn't come here, maybe he'd be willing to do one with you and I – I think he owes it to our voters to come and make the case.
HANNITY: You're now challenging. So, this is going to be another Hannity one-on-one debate.
DESANTIS: Let's do it, right?
Here's the thing, though. You owe it to the voters to come and make the case. No one is entitled to anything. You can say, 'Oh, there's some poll months before.' No. You have got to make the case. You owe it to the voters. So, I'm going to show up everywhere. I think that's what we were able to do. And, you know, there were some, I think, some important issues that were discussed tonight. There's also others that I know you and I have talked about that weren't discussed. But at the end of the day, I think the thing that was clear from this--there's a lot of talk, a lot of people had good things to say, [but] I'm the guy that's done it and in Florida we did everything I promised. We delivered, and we're sick of the talk with Republicans. They always promise all this, like what are the two biggest issues, arguably right now? The debt and the border. You and I have been talking about this for as long as we've known each other. Isn't a time we get a leader to come in and bring this stuff into a conclusion and a landing? And I think if we're able to, you know, to do that with the nomination and win the election, we're going to be able to get all this stuff done.
On slapping down the on-stage squabbling:
Tonight there was a lot of bickering on the stage. My thing is, we owe it to the American people to give our vision about how we're going to reverse this country's decline. And I think I was able to do that. I think some of the crosstalk, if I was at home watching that, I would turn the channel when I saw that. So we were able to, I think, rise above that and deliver our message.
On what he will accomplish as president:
In 2033, in January, what would I say to the American people after serving two terms, and that's really the vision of, you're going to be able to get ahead again in this country. We're going to have an economy that works for people. We're going to have our sovereignty restored and borders enforced. We're going to make sure that we have education, not indoctrination. We will be the world's leading superpower. We will fend off the threat from China successfully. We're not going to have crime overrunning every city in America anymore. And we're going to restore the Constitution so that we have a limited government that works beside us and on our behalf – not a weaponized government that comes after us. If we can do that, then we will have restored the shining city on the hill that Reagan talks about, and we'll be able to turn over America to our kids and grandkids better than we found it.
On the border crisis:
These guys in DC, they don't care. There's no urgency. I mean, some of our guys in the House care, but like, the elites in DC, they don't care. Biden doesn't care. He's missing-in-action on this as the carnage mounts. And I agree. I mean, I think that this is above all a national security issue. Now, there's also nuts and bolts issues. I mean, the amount of illegals that are pouring in, medical care is being taxed, schools. It's overwhelming communities far away from the border. You see it in New York City.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Stands Above the Rest and Wins Second GOP Primary Debate,2023-09-27T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-stands-above-the-rest-and-wins-second-gop-primary,"
""I've done it, while others have talked about it."" 
SIMI VALLEY, CA - Ron DeSantis notched his second debate win tonight with a commanding performance at the Reagan Library by focusing on his bold vision to reverse American decline and restore the American dream.
Following the debate, Ron DeSantis for President campaign manager James Uthmeier said:
""Tonight, a passionate and visionary Ron DeSantis stood above the entirety of the Republican field, won the debate, and showed Americans watching at home why he is the only candidate prepared to reverse America's decline as our next president.
""He successfully drove home his vision on how to lead a Great American Revival and reminded viewers at home that he is the only candidate who has delivered on key issues. From making Florida the number one state economy in the nation, to banning CCP land purchase, to firing Soros prosecutors and bringing Florida to a 50-year crime low, DeSantis has the proven record. As your president, he will get the job done.
""Ron DeSantis also called out Donald Trump for his failure to join the debate stage and defend his record to the American people, and his refusal to go out on the campaign trail and work to earn this nomination. The Trump strategy is to hide in the basement – and DeSantis reminded Republicans that you can't beat Joe Biden by acting like Joe Biden.
""Donald Trump doesn't want to show up because he is afraid to defend the failures of his administration and be reminded of the DeSantis success story on each of those fronts in Florida. From adding nearly $8 trillion to national debt and leaving the border wall unfinished, to failing drain the swamp and shutting our country down because Fauci said so, Trump has a lot to answer for.
""Our party – and nation – can't afford the Republican nominee being 'Missing In Action'. Ron DeSantis is notching big debate wins, outworking the competition, and creating strong momentum for our campaign on the ground in the early states. This two-man race is now entering a new phase and it's game on.""
The top moment of the night came when DeSantis said: ""Donald Trump is missing in action.""
""People in Washington are shutting down the American dream with their reckless behavior. They borrowed. They printed. They spent, and now you're paying more for everything. They are the reason for that they have shut down our national sovereignty by allowing our border to be wide open. So please spare me the crocodile tears for these people. They need to change what's going on. Where's Joe Biden? He's completely missing in action from leadership. And you know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record where they added 7.8 trillion to the debt. That set the stage for the inflation that we have. Now I can tell you this as governor of Florida: We cut taxes. We ran surpluses. We've paid down over 25% of our state debt. And I vetoed wasteful spending when it came to my desk. As your president, when they send me a bloating spending bill that's going to cause your prices to go up, I'm going to take out this veto pen, and I'm going to send it right back to them.""
Watch HERE.
Another big moment came when DeSantis slapped down the on-stage squabbling by saying:
""Here's the thing that I find interesting. I appreciate a lot of the things they're saying. I'm the only one up here who's gotten in the big fights and has delivered big victories for the people of Florida. And that's what it's all about. You can always talk. But when it gets hot in there, when they're shooting arrows at you, are you going to stand up for parents' rights? Keep the state free? Are you going to be able to do all those things? In the state of Florida, because of our success, the Democratic Party lies in ruins. We have won the big fights. We have turned our state into a Republican state. People respond to leadership. I've done it while others have talked about it.""

Hutchinson Campaign Press Release - Governor Hutchinson Unveils Interactive AI Interface,2023-09-27T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/hutchinson-campaign-press-release-governor-hutchinson-unveils-interactive-ai-interface,"
Even though he won't debate tonight, voters will be able to know where he stands on the issues
BENTONVILLE, Ark. — Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President, unveiled this afternoon an interactive artificial intelligence (AI) interface that voters will be able to utilize and ask specific issue-based questions. The interface has been programmed to respond with Governor Hutchinson's stance on important issues facing the United States and American families.
""The American people are going to have an opportunity to hear from some candidates this evening at the second RNC Presidential Primary Debate, but they won't have the opportunity to hear from all of us,"" said Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the 46th Governor of Arkansas and a current Republican candidate for President. ""It is vitally important for every voter to be able to have an answer to their question and not simply rely on a moderator to hopefully ask it for them. That is why I am excited to unveil our Ask Asa platform this afternoon. This tool will allow voters to ask questions on their most important issues and get a response back from me.""
The Ask Asa AI interface can be accessed by visiting askasa.us. The interface has been loaded with Governor Hutchinson's past public remarks, speeches, interviews, and policy positions in order to provide a realistic answer to voters' questions.
Governor Hutchinson instructed his campaign to develop this tool due to the growing prevalence of AI within the everyday lives of Americans. He believes the next Commander-in-Chief should understand and utilize the capabilities AI possesses to share knowledge and enrich our society.
""I have always led when it has come to investing in computer science, whether that is in our schools or in the private sector. By learning more about AI and utilizing it in our campaign, we are ensuring that my vision for America can be accessed by as many Americans as possible,"" concluded Gov. Hutchinson.

Statement by Will Hurd on the Campaign's Next Steps,2023-09-27T00:00:00+00:00,Will Hurd,/documents/statement-will-hurd-the-campaigns-next-steps,"
Republican presidential candidate and former Texas Rep. Will Hurd released the following statement regarding the status of his campaign ahead of the second Republican National Convention (RNC) debate:
""Just 14 weeks ago, I became the final candidate to enter the Republican primary field. In the short time since, our campaign received donations from over 50,000 individuals who support our vision and registered at 3% in New Hampshire polling. Unfortunately, we narrowly missed the cut for the second debate and our campaign is at an inflection point.
""I entered this race for a few simple reasons. First, to ensure this experiment called America lasts for another 247 years. Second, Americans deserve better than the rematch from hell between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. If the Republican party nominates Donald Trump or the various personalities jockeying to imitate his divisive, crass behavior, we will lose. Third, not enough people are talking about real, achievable solutions to the generational defining challenges that are in front of us. These include artificial intelligence, our new Cold War with China, and the complexity of the ongoing crisis at our southern border.
""My team and I are constantly evaluating whether we have the resources to chart a path to victory. I'm headed to New Hampshire to spread my message to the Granite State ahead of the First In the Nation primary. Educating voters on how to solve these existential issues is important, and hopefully other candidates will follow my lead.""

WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: Obviously, the President United States cannot fire anybody in the private sector. However, we should look back at the first bill in Congress under Joe Biden, the first bill has $86 billion for the Union pensions because they continue to over-promise, yet under-deliver. One of the challenges that we have in the current negotiations is that they want four day, French work weeks, but more money. They want more benefits, working fewer hours, that is simply not going to stand. I sat in a finance committee hearing when a widow came before the committee who promised pensions from the unions, $4,000 a month. Unfortunately, it had been cut to $1,000 a month. We must make sure that we honor the commitments that we make, and one of the ways that we do that: do not over over-promise and then under-deliver, and leave the taxpayers on the hook. I'll say this: Joe Biden should not be on the picket line, he should be at the southern border working to close our southern border because it is wide open and insecure, leading to the deaths of 70,000 Americans in the last 12 months because of fentanyl. It is devastating. Every county in America is now a border county, because fentanyl has devastated Americans in every single state. I will also say 6 million illegal crossings since Joe Biden has taken office, and he eliminated Title 42. The one thing he should do is finish the wall, reinstate title 42, and get the job done.

Tim Scott: There is not a redeeming quality in slavery. He and Kamala should have just taken the one sentence out. America has suffered because of slavery, but we've overcome that. We are the greatest nation on Earth, because we faced our demons in the mirror and made a decision. So often, we think that all the issues, you talked about crime and education and healthcare, we always think that those issues go back to slavery. Here's the challenge though: Black families survived slavery. We survived poll taxes and literacy tests. We survived discrimination being woven into the laws of our country. What was hard to survive, was Johnson's Great Society, where they decided to take the black father out of the household to get a check in the mail, and you can now measure that in unemployment, in crime, in devastation. If you want to restore hope, you've got to restore the family restore capitalism, and put Americans back at work, together as one American family. Our nation continues to go in the right direction, it's why I can say I have been discriminated against, but America is not a racist country. Never, ever, doubt who we are. We are the greatest country on God's green earth. And frankly, the city on the hill needs a brand new leader, and I'm asking for your vote.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Laura Ingraham live on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On the importance on showing up to debate:
I think it's interesting that he [Donald Trump] is not willing to stand on that stage. I think he owes it to all the voters to show up, defend his record, and articulate what he would do going forward and what he would might do differently. And he's not willing to do that. I think the voters have a right to hear from all the candidates? I mean, I think we can talk about a lot of the things--he's running in 2024 on a lot of the same promises he ran on in 2016 and didn't deliver on. He said he was going to drain the swamp. They didn't drain the swamp at all. He still defends hiring Christopher Wray, he didn't fire Wray. He didn't fire Fauci. He said Mexico was gonna pay for the border wall. That didn't happen. They started the wall, but we've got a lot more to be able to do to finish the wall. He said he was going to eliminate the national debt. They added almost a trillion dollars to the debt in four years and then remember, he promised to appoint a special counsel for Hillary Clinton then after the election two weeks later, he's like, 'Oh, no, forget about it.' That's what you say before the election, it's not what you say after. So now, he's saying he's going to do one for Biden, but he had promised to do that for you in 2016. So I think it's about, you got to deliver on these things. If we do the same thing and we don't deliver on them 100%, we're not going to turn the country around.
On reducing harmful government spending:
He [Donald Trump] made the decision to turn the country over to Anthony Fauci. Those decisions, I think were bad. They were mistaken decisions that led to the borrowing and printing of trillions of dollars. They did 4.2 trillion just in 2020, before Biden even took office. Of course Biden added gas to the fire, but that is why people's prices have gone up. It's because of what Washington did to inflate the currency and spending. But here's the thing about this. He says he says that he did everything right. He said he wouldn't do anything different. In Florida, you know, we were listening to them and then after a few weeks, I'm like, 'This is not right.' And we went in our own direction. Our median income is still going up, even through COVID, because we chose freedom over Fauci. I think of our economic track record, where we've actually paid down almost 25% of our state's debt since I've been governor. We run big budget surpluses, done big tax cuts, and have the number one state for new business formations. That's the track record we need to bring to Washington and I'll be able to get the job done.
On the importance of winning in 2024:
We're not going to get a mulligan on the 2024 election. We've had three straight election cycles in a row where Democrats have a playbook to beat Republicans. And if we repeat that same playbook in 24, we're going to lose. We were supposed to have a big red wave in 2022. I thought your monologue was excellent outlining the problems but all those problems were there in November of 2022. Republicans should have capitalized on that by winning a huge red wave, and that did not happen. Voters chose Democrats over some of our candidates, except in Florida. In Florida, we delivered a historic reelection victory and that's because we delivered on our promises. So as you look forward, the time for talking is over. I look at the border situation. I look at the budget situation. These are issues that Republicans have been talking about for decades and yet they still persist. I'm the only guy running that can say, everything I promised my voters I would do, I delivered on 100% of the promises. So yes, I will beat Biden, but even more importantly than that, I'm the guy that will actually deliver 100% of the results that we need to turn this country around.
On standing strong and doing what's right:
I took all the flak from the media for so long, and here we are. Our kids are protected. Disney doesn't have any more special tax breaks, and we're just humming along doing great. It shows you if you're willing to stand strong and hold your ground, you can win these fights. I'll be the only guy on that stage tomorrow night who has actually dug in, fought these big fights and delivered big victories.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined The Doug Wagner Show on WMT News Radio. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On reversing Biden's harmful electric vehicle mandates:
We're going to rip out all the Biden mandates, all this stuff that they're doing to try to promote EVs. I have no problem with you purchasing one on your own, if that's what you want. There's nothing wrong with that. This is a competitive market and that's how it should be, but what he's doing makes us more reliant on China because China mines the critical minerals that go into things like these batteries. We actually could do that here in the United States. Biden won't let us do that. So he's intentionally making that decision. It will weaken biofuels in Iowa and throughout the Midwest, no question, because it's an attack on liquid fuels. It's bad for the auto companies, it's bad for the auto workers, because most Americans don't want electric vehicles. I mean, you know, I'm a former Ford F-150 owner, the most popular truck in America, and I would not want that to be electric. I want it to be gas.
On reviving America's energy dominance:
We put out our energy plan last week in Texas and my goal [is to] be energy independent from these hostile regimes, but even more importantly, we need to be the dominant energy producer in the entire world. That'll be good for people going into the pump, it'll be good for businesses, it'll reduce inflation, it's good for our industrial base and jobs, and it is good for our national security to be energy dominant. I think the push for electric vehicles and the Green New Deal cuts totally against that. And what I've found in Florida, we've had a massive reduction in carbon emissions but it's because of natural gas being used in the power plants instead of things like coal, so it's much cleaner. The environmentalists and the left, they oppose using natural gas. So we're not going to allow the electric vehicle stuff to go through. We're going to make sure people can make cars that people actually want to buy and that you as an American have the right to buy what you want. We will, in short, save the American automobile.
On protecting farmers from the weaponization of government:
Think about all the Iowa farmers that had to deal with the waters of the United States. You have a puddle on your property, and then the federal government can come in and have jurisdiction. It's insane. Now the Supreme Court gave us relief from that. But Biden's people, they're gonna go at it again. They're going to try to get their nose in everything they can. And that's why one of the things we've got to do when I'm President, we're going to end weaponization of government, we're going to end this fourth branch of government. We're going to have the government returned to its rightful owners, which is we the people, as the Founding Fathers intended. They only created three branches of government back in 1787. They did not create an administrative state that imposes its will on us without our consent, and we need to change that.
On his support from Iowans:
We've now done 58 of the 99 counties. We're going to be back the week after the debate to do more, and we're going to knock out all 99, just like I promised. And I think that what you see when this happens is, Iowans really appreciate you showing up. They appreciate, particularly in the smaller communities, that you go, listen to them and [give them a] chance for questions. And what you find is, people are concerned that the country is just in a state of malaise; our government's off the rails. Just making ends meet now is difficult for people who are doing everything right and working hard.

Tallahassee, FL - This week, Ron DeSantis is in California to participate in the Republican National Committee's second primary debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley. The debate comes after a whirlwind month of campaigning and spreading the DeSantis vision to reverse Biden's failures, revive the American dream, and deliver victories for American families.
Conservative leaders from the California State Assembly today welcomed DeSantis to the Golden State.
""As a father of four, protecting parental rights is non-negotiable,"" said CA State Assemblyman Joe Patterson. ""Governor DeSantis is a proven leader who as President will not only advocate for parents, but will fight for our kids.""
""We need a President who will fight for small businesses and protect our basic freedoms—something many Californians have had to sacrifice,"" said CA State Assemblyman Heath Flora. ""Governor DeSantis is the only candidate I trust to take this fight to the White House and win.""
""As President, Governor DeSantis will stand up to the radical left and protect our freedoms,"" said CA State Assemblyman Tom Lackey.
Following the debate, Ron DeSantis will deliver a keynote address at the California GOP Fall Convention. This trip to California also comes ahead of DeSantis' upcoming debate against CA Governor Gavin Newsom, which will contrast Florida's success against California's failed leftist policies.

BENTONVILLE, Ark. — The Asa for America campaign released the following statement today regarding Governor Asa Hutchinson not qualifying for the second RNC Presidential Primary Debate. This statement can be attributed to Governor Asa Hutchinson:
""Despite falling short of the RNC's polling requirement for inclusion in the second Presidential Primary Debate, I will continue our campaign to bring out the best of America with events scheduled in Iowa, New Hampshire, and across the country in the next several weeks. I understand that the RNC and the media are trying to reduce the number of candidates, but I measure success based on the response I receive in early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. My goal is to increase my polling numbers to 4% in an early state before Thanksgiving. If that goal is met, then I remain competitive and in contention for either Caucus Day or Primary Day. I entered this race because it is critically important for a leader within the Republican Party to stand up to Donald Trump and call him out on misleading his supporters and the American people. I intend to continue doing that and look forward to holding a press conference in Detroit on Wednesday where I will highlight his false promises to blue collar and union workers in Michigan and across America."" — Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President

""Some Republicans want to retreat on life. I know life is a gift from God and this is a fight we must win."" – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Today, Tim Scott released a new ad calling on Republicans to stand up for life as the radical Left advocates for abortion on demand. The ad entitled ""Extremist"" comes as Tim has been consistent and vocal on how he plans to protect life. This ad will air nationwide on Newsmax beginning today. It is part of Tim's previously announced $8 million ad buy.
Tim will participate in the second GOP Presidential Debate in Simi Valley, California this Wednesday. The debate will air live on Fox Business on Wednesday, September 27, at 9 PM ET.

TRANSCRIPT:
TIM SCOTT:  If the radical Left wins, abortions will be performed on minors without their parent's consent.
Babies old enough to feel pain will be aborted.
And poor single mothers like mine, will be told aborting their children will help the economy.
Yet, these people say I am the extremist.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because some Republicans want to retreat on life. I know life is a gift from God and this is a fight we must win.

On reversing Bidenomics and reducing the price of gas:
Gas is going up everywhere, and that's because of Biden's policies, so, we rolled out our plan for energy dominance. We are going to get the gas prices down. I mean, we have the resources. This is such a great thing for us to do to help people, workers, businesses, jobs, and our national security, so it's a no brainer from that perspective. Biden wants them going up, we want them going down. Now California, they impose all these ridiculous regulations on their energy, and so, their prices are purely a result of bad state policies here. But you know, the problem with California is they're a glutton for punishment. They do all this, they're such a big state, they affect the states around them. Arizona and Nevada have very high gas prices, and it's not because they're doing the same California policies, but California is so big that the refining and everything that goes into it spills over in these other states. I would like to look to see, can the federal government provide Californians some relief from their own state government? Because wouldn't you rather be paying $2 a gallon less if you're in California? I think that'd be a huge relief to a lot of people here.
On Biden's harmful electric vehicle mandates:
What Biden is doing is ultimately going to destroy these car companies, and it's going to mean less manufacturing jobs, and I want strong manufacturing jobs. You know, we've got a lot of auto manufacturing in the Sunbelt now, and then those Right to Work states. You know, I want jobs across the board. You repeal those EV mandates, the companies are going to do better, the workers are going to do better. So what they're going to end up doing, if Biden's policies stick, they're going to constantly be arguing over how to slice up a smaller and smaller pie. Because Ford, GM, they get taken to the cleaners on these EV sales. It's all just about the government subsidies.
On his upcoming debate with Gavin Newsom:
He said he would debate me, so I said, 'Let's do it.' I think it's an important debate for the country, not saying who's better, Florida or California, because that debate is over because people have voted with their feet. They've left California and come to Florida, not the other way around. He has lost massive amounts of population. No governor in California history has ever witnessed population loss at all on net. And he's had it -- it's because of the policies that he's driving people away. But, what's the future for the country? The future for the country, for what the left would want to do, is just double down on the California policies, and so I think it's going to be an important debate. I think he's definitely angling for it. I think Biden, I don't think Biden is going to step down willingly. I think it's harder to dislodge somebody who's an incumbent president than people assume it would be. But I think the Democrat establishment really, really is concerned, particularly if they have to run against somebody like me. I think that their view on Trump is that he will help energize their base to come out in ways that maybe some other Republicans won't. I don't know if that's true, per se, the way they're thinking it, but I do think they think that. So I think they're looking for how do we get away from this? Because, you know, Biden is floundering on the world stage. I mean, it's been really embarrassing to see what he's doing.

The memo takes direct aim at Trump, Pence's former boss and the current front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, while attempting to draw a line between Trump's current agenda and the one enacted when they both occupied the White House.""

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Second GOP Primary Debate at the Reagan Library,2023-09-25T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-second-gop-primary-debate-the-reagan-library,"
Tallahassee, FL - To: Friends, Donors, and SupportersFrom: James Uthmeier, Campaign ManagerRe: Second GOP Primary Debate at the Reagan LibraryDate: September 23, 2023
As we head into the second primary debate on Wednesday evening, we are excited to build on last month's strong performance in Milwaukee and take advantage of another opportunity for Ron DeSantis to deliver his message to millions of Americans across the country who are just now beginning to tune in to the race.
The fundamentals of this battle for the GOP nomination have not changed since the last debate. Ron DeSantis is the only candidate that can beat both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and we are the only campaign built for the long haul in terms of resources and organization. When pressed, the media and D.C. politicians privately admit to this as well.
That's why many of them continue to prop up the former president, even after a disastrous stretch in which he gave the middle finger to a packed Iowa stadium and attacked pro-life legislation passed not only in Florida, but also in Iowa, South Carolina, and Georgia. Trump also admitted his intent to capitulate to Democrats on key issues if he is re-elected, and he continues to replicate Joe Biden's campaign-from-the-basement strategy despite his own advisors even acknowledging it will hurt him in Iowa.
Ron DeSantis on Wednesday night will again show the American people why he strikes so much fear in the establishment. He is the only candidate that has both the vision to reverse the nation's decline and the proven conservative record to show he can get the job done.
While other candidates may take this opportunity to distract or level false attacks, DeSantis stays laser-focused on the mission at hand of reviving the American Dream and delivering victories for hardworking families. He is undoubtedly the strongest leader in this race, the leader who has both the courage to fight and the strength to Win.
Ron DeSantis isn't afraid to show up, debate the issues, and prove that he has what it takes to be the leader of the greatest nation on earth. Our team is looking forward to another big victory on Wednesday night and we invite you to join us on social media to help echo the governor's message throughout the debate.
Thank you again for all you do to support the governor, his family, and our team. The future of America depends on it.

Tim Scott: Yeah. I think what you see, what you just played is exactly what I hope to see. Hope you see on Wednesday night. Is a guy being authentically who he is. I wanna be myself. The goal is for us to be able to have a conversation about the most important issues facing this nation and frankly defend the next generation of kids who are losing hope that the American Dream will work for a kid in rural Iowa or inner city Chicago. I'm the defender for those who cannot find someone to stand up. I will be the voice for those who feel voiceless because I've been that kid. I felt like there was no hope for my future living in poverty and growing up in a single-parent household. But I will talk about the contrasts that exist on that stage because the American people deserve someone they can have confidence in because we've lived a similar journey, that our obstacles became our opportunities. And frankly, looking in the mirror, the problems revealed the promise. Because we are Americans, we are remarkable, but we have to act like it.

""Society needs to be grounded in truth. And if you're telling me a man can get pregnant, you're telling me a man can become a woman. That is not true. I'm not going to accept that as true, and I'm not going to be complicit in a lie."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis sat down for an exclusive, in-studio interview with Glenn Beck. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On reversing Bidenomics:
You want to know why gas and groceries and home prices, and all this, why has that ballooned to where people that are doing everything right, people that are working hard, trying to raise their families, but the American Dream has slipped away from them? That is happening because of what business as usual in Washington has brought to them. So if you want to continue on the status quo, you are saying that you are committed to shutting down opportunity and continuing to shut down the American Dream for people. So we have to do a different way. We just cannot possibly go in this direction. And I think people realize that what's happened in Washington is the cause of all the problems that they've had. So the people that are defending the status quo, they're the ones that have caused the problem. Wouldn't you want to change, when you see all the trouble you've put so many people through, how people are now struggling, more than they have probably in my whole adult lifetime, just to do the necessities of life?
On if a man can become a woman:
No. How ridiculous that we're even asking that question. And you know, sometimes people will knock me because they'll say that 'he's talking about woke, and you shouldn't worry about it.' Like people say, 'who cares about it, right?' Society needs to be grounded in truth. And if you're telling me a man can get pregnant, you're telling me a man can become a woman. That is not true. I'm not going to accept that as true, and I'm not going to be complicit in a lie. And if our society is built on a mountain of lies, even on those issues, which maybe some people don't care as much about, how are you going to have a situation where you're going to get things right? So being rooted in truth, the truth will set you free is very, very important.
On reviving America's energy dominance:
Our mantra is, we want the United States to be energy dominant. Why would we want that? Well, it's good for consumers. Americans can go and get gas for $2 instead of $4. And I think it's going to go a lot higher than $4, unfortunately. Businesses will thrive. It affects everything we buy in terms of the prices, so it gives people relief, jobs, industrial base. National security, though, this is the one thing that we have that would give us an advantage over China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, you name it. This is the closest thing to a silver bullet that we have.
On his Day One priorities as President:
We'll do a lot on the first day. We will declare the border a national emergency. We're going to take all the Biden's EOs, particularly on the economy, and throw those in the trash can, so we can get America moving again. And there'll be a whole host of other things. We're going to nix CBDC on day one, central bank digital currency. Not going to happen under my watch. So there'll be a bunch of things. But I think that the border, that's a core attribute of sovereignty. You're either a country or you're not. And we've got to get that one right, so that'll be you know, 12:30 or whenever you're done giving the speech, you're going to have to sign that one in.
On bringing back constitutional accountability:
We're going to be rolling out our way to slay the administrative state. I've talked about it a little bit, but we're going to put it out and do an event where we kind of list all the different levers that are available for you to push. There are levers. Now look, they're going to fight back, they're going to sue you. It's not like everyone's just going to lay down, but there are a lot of levers that Republican presidents have not been willing to push, because I think a lot of them come in thinking that they can win these people over or hope that they can win these people over, and you can't. They have accumulated power, and they're not going to give it back willingly. And what's happening, in terms of the weaponization of this federal power, the founding fathers would have predicted this. When you have power accumulate without constitutional accountability, human nature being what it is, they are going to abuse their power. That's just the reality. So we've got to bring the constitutional accountability back.
On Donald Trump's criticisms of Florida's heartbeat bill:
It's one thing to say that there are strategic judgments that can be made about how to advance the cause. But that's something different than saying once a state has already enacted protections, to castigate that as being something that's terrible. And here's the thing, the damage that he did with that is more than just his campaign. There's going to be potentially on the ballot in Florida a referendum for a constitutional amendment to basically have abortion on demand. The left is pursuing it. And if that passes, that means the legislature can never do anything to protect life. Do you think they're going to run ads to Republicans and independents showing Trump voters saying 'Trump didn't like this, vote the other way for us?' Of course they are. They're going to weaponize what he said to try to defeat the cause of life.
On Joe Biden's impeachment inquiry:
I think that the corruption is real. I think they should be inquiring and investigating, but you know, he should be impeached for the border. He is derelict in the performance of his duties. He took an oath to ensure that the laws of this country were faithfully executed, and he has flagrantly violated his oath of office. That is definitely an impeachable offense. And so I think on that dereliction of duty, that's the cleanest case that they should do. I do think they should be getting the information on the corruption, and I think there is real corruption with the Biden family.

""Joe Biden and Big Labor bosses are undermining the dignity of work and setting autoworkers up for failure. They're playing politics with people's lives."" – Tim Scott 
CHARLESTON, SC — Today, Tim Scott released the following statement responding to the United Auto Workers (UAW) complaint, the union's ""chaos"" agenda, and Biden's weak leadership:
""American workers continue to witness how a weak president leads to all sorts of chaos at home and abroad.
""Joe Biden and Big Labor bosses are undermining the dignity of work and setting autoworkers up for failure. They're playing politics with people's lives.
""Biden's electric vehicle mandates are bad for workers. Whenever Democrats have to pick between elite environmentalists and American workers, they side against working people.
""Big Labor's wish list of a massive pay raise for a French-style work week would make the American auto industry less competitive, encourage outsourcing, and leave workers even more vulnerable to automation. It would put the industry on a path to more taxpayer bailouts or bankruptcy while the Big Labor bosses line their pockets.
""The UAW is one of the most corrupt and scandal-plagued unions in America. They are showing their true colors once again and autoworkers and taxpayers will be left holding the bag together.
""They want to threaten me and shut me up. They don't scare me. I will truly fight for American workers and jobs, promote the dignity of work, and end the Biden retreat from the values that make our nation exceptional.""

""I don't think protecting life is a terrible thing. I think it's a noble cause."" 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Ron DeSantis today joined Simon Conway on WHO's The Simon Conway Show. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On his plan to revive American energy dominance:
We just put out a really strong energy policy when we were out in West Texas, in Midland. We need this country to be energy dominant. We can produce untold amounts of energy in ways that will benefit the American people, benefit businesses, benefit jobs, and most importantly, benefit our national security. Biden's policy makes us weaker against China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. Our energy policy will give us a huge competitive advantage over all those countries that don't have our best interests at heart.
On the upcoming debate:
I do think that anytime you have an ability to speak to large numbers of people--I don't know how many people watched the last debate, I heard it was over 10 million, I don't know how many people are going to watch this, but it'll definitely be in the millions--that's a great opportunity for you to be able to do. I can tell you, in my case, the liberal media is not going to carry my message in a positive way. I mean, they're going to whack me. They view me as a threat, and that's how they're going to do it, so it is good to be able to speak directly to people in their homes.
On Donald Trump's criticism of Florida's heartbeat bill:
We did a heartbeat protection act similar to what Governor Reynolds signed in Iowa that protects babies that have a detectable heartbeat. I think every single person that considers themselves pro-life thinks that that's positive, that you're saving lives. And the former President, Donald Trump, said that heartbeat legislation like Iowa did, and like Florida did, he called it a, quote, terrible thing. I don't think protecting life is a terrible thing. I think it's a noble cause. And so I've not only said that I support a culture of life, we've delivered on that in Florida, and we would be able to stand credibly for the cause of life as president. I think the fact that he's now running against states like Iowa that have done pro-life legislation, that's a major change from how he ran in 2015 or 2016. I thought his comments were totally unacceptable. I rejected him in total. Your Governor, Kim Reynolds, put out a very strong statement saying that it's not terrible to stand for life, it's the right thing to do. And so, I think that that may end up being a dividing line, just because he's flipped his position in a way that I think most Iowa caucus goers are going to find very, very troubling.
On securing the border and stopping the invasion:
Most importantly, we're going to treat the drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. We're going to use deadly force against them, particularly when they're bringing fentanyl across the border. We've lost 10s of 1000s of Americans each and every year since this fentanyl outbreak. And since we've had the cartels moving this into our country, I run into angel moms who have lost kids from fentanyl overdose. And the thing about it is, some of these kids, you know, they're studying, they're stressed. They're in college, and they think they're taking like a Xanax, and it turns out it's laced with fentanyl, and they take it and it's fatal and they die. And then you have a mother that has lost a child. And this is happening all over our country. The carnage is unbelievable. And yet Joe Biden, he's missing in action on this. He's not doing anything to take care of it. I don't want to see those fentanyl deaths. I don't want to see the cartels, sex trafficking and human trafficking people into our country any longer. I don't want to see communities overwhelmed with massive numbers of illegal aliens like you see at the Texas border and throughout our country. I will be the president that finally brings this border issue to a conclusion. We've heard a lot of talk about it over many years. Now is the time to get the job done and I will get the job done.
On doing what's right as a leader and not bending to pressure:
_I get attacked now by the media because they say, 'some mega donor is criticizing him for this or that.' And I'm just thinking to myself, 'wait a minute, is that a bad thing that I'm doing what I believe in, regardless of what the donors say?' Would you rather have a candidate who is just trying to kowtow to people that are wealthy? No, you want a candidate who is going to do what they think is right and lead. And what I say is, people can support me or not. Obviously, I want to get as much support across all fronts as possible, but I'm not going to twist myself into a pretzel. I'm going to do what I think is righ_t.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: Sanctuary Cities Like New York Are Experiencing What Texas and Arizona Experience Everyday,2023-09-21T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-sanctuary-cities-like-new-york-are-experiencing,"
""Seeing the devastation in Texas today – thousands of illegal immigrants coming to the border – it's something that sanctuary cities like New York, San Francisco and other places haven't experienced."" – Tim Scott
NEW YORK CITY, NY – Today, Tim Scott joined Martha McCallum on FOX News to discuss the crisis at the southern border and how, as president, he would secure the border.
WATCH HERE
Martha MacCallum: If President Scott were looking at what was going on at the border. If President Biden was out and you were in. What do you do on day one?
Tim Scott: Day one, is you eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, you get rid of the 87,000 IRS agents that he was going to hire, take that $40 billion, I have legislation to do so, that would do so. I would sign that legislation, and put that $40 billion in the hands of our border patrol agents. We would double the number of agents that we have on the on the border and provide more resources, more incentives for longer hours. In addition to that, I would certainly welcome more of our military there on the border....
What we see is a lot of noise from frankly, here in New York, where you see the governor, the mayor fighting with the president for more resources because they're finally experiencing what Texas and Arizona have been experiencing for years. Seeing the devastation in Texas today – thousands of illegal immigrants coming to the border – it's something that sanctuary cities like New York, San Francisco and other places haven't experienced. Now that they're experiencing, they're having fights within their parties.
Martha MacCallum: A wake up call.
Tim Scott: It should happen every day, though. We should never surrender our southern border, and we should never apologize for keeping it strong.

CBS Austin
ANCHOR: Today, Florida Governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis unveiled his energy agenda in oil rich Texas. DeSantis says he would pull the US out of global climate change packs and end all commitments for the country to cut net greenhouse emissions to zero. He would also approve more pipelines and allow mining and extradition of oil, gas and coal and uranium, along with other minerals on federal lands. DeSantis says his plan would result in America not having to rely on what he called hostile nations for its energy needs ever again.
DESANTIS: We will use our energy dominance to deny our enemies revenue. We will bankrupt their ability to threaten America and we will help our allies become less reliant on our adversaries.

Newsmax, Newsline, Addison Smith
Energy security, energy independence, and energy dominance. That was the core message of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. His energy policy speech that he delivered here in Midland, Texas today right here, this oil real rig field behind me the government with oil and gas workers from around the city some of whom shared how President Biden and his energy policies have threatened their way of life. During his announcement, DeSantis listed about a number of Biden's energy policies and how he would change them as president policies like the EV mandate that he's long been pushing for from the EPA, these green energy subsidies, these net zero goals by 2030 DeSantis called all of those out saying he would take action against those as president. Other policy items included refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve fast tracking more oil and gas drilling, and get this quote, replacing the phrase climate change with energy dominance in national security and foreign policy guidance. DeSantis said he is optimistic that with his energy policy that gasoline prices could go back down to $2 a gallon in 2025 after shortly after his inauguration a very ambitious goal but according to him, a realistic one. Now, it wasn't just energy that he focused on he took a brief break to slam climate change extremists for peddling weight for doing what he said was fear mongering convincing people for example, that you shouldn't have kids because kids the environment the planet is not suitable for them to grow up in and it's not good for the planet to be having kids this overpopulation agenda that the left is pushing DeSantis came after all of that left no stone unturned today here in Midland, Texas.
NewsWest9
ANCHOR: Florida Governor and Republican Presidential Hopeful Ron Desantis visited Midland Wednesday morning.
Desantis was at an oil rig called the ""Permian Deep Rock Oil Company"" and talked about how the Permian Basin is the power house of the United States and his plans if he becomes president.
One of his goals, Desantis said, is to lower gas prices and not rely on foreign countries for oil.
Desantis believes his energy plan will boost US oil and natural gas production and insists gas prices could drop to $2 per gallon by 2025.
""So here's what's happening on January 20th, 2025, there's gonna be a new sheriff in town as your president,"" Desantis said. ""I will restore our freedom to fuel, I will ensure the United States of America is the dominant energy producer in the entire world [and] I will ensure our country doesn't have to rely on hostile nations for its energy needs ever again.""
Desantis said he would unravel climate change mandates and dismiss threats from intensifying weather events as fear tactics. He also said there's other more realistic ways to make change.
""If we just have natural gas exported to these developing countries, they are going to burn less fossil fuels or have less emissions as a result of that. So, I think this is the ticket that we need to do,"" Desantis said. ""I can tell you in Florida, our emissions reduced not because of mandates and yes, we do do solar, market-based solar. We've got a lot of sunshine in Florida, of course, and that's a part of it. But, the main part of it was the natural gas that is much more clean-burning than some of the coal plants and that's what we've got to do. We've got to recognize that.""
Desantis said he would lift EV mandates and repeal the clean power plan.

Pence Campaign Press Release - Mike Pence on Trump's Middle-Class Tax Increase,2023-09-21T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-mike-pence-trumps-middle-class-tax-increase,"
Mike Pence supports free trade with free nations, which is a stark contrast from his former running-mate Donald Trump—who has proposed a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports.
As Mike Pence has explained, ""Trump is advocating a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the country that would cost 500,000 jobs. At a time with 17% inflation across the country [since Joe Biden took office], the last thing we need is to raise the cost of goods at the border. When it comes to leadership in the world, we stood strong with our allies and stood up to our enemies. He and his imitators in this race are backing away from American leadership.""
The one-pager below provides additional details about the damage Trump's proposal would do to our nation's economy.
Trump's Middle-Class Tax Increase 
Trump's new 10% tax increase on all consumers would completely undo the 2017 tax cuts 
Key Facts:

President Trump has proposed an across-the-board, 10% tariff on all imported goods that would erase the benefits of tax cuts and increase inflation at the worst possible time.
Trump's plan would raise inflation at a time when high prices are the number one issue facing Americans.
The tariffs would hit poor and middle-income Americans the hardest.
Trump's tariffs are flawed foreign policy that would punish our allies and reward adversaries like China.

President Trump has proposed an across-the-board 10% tariff on all imported goods that would erase the benefits of tax cuts and increase inflation at the worst possible time.

According to the Tax Foundation, the plan would increase taxes by $300 billion a year.
In five years, the plan would increase taxes by $1.5 trillion and erase the 2017 tax cuts.
Trump's new tax increase would also destroy over 500,000 American jobs.

Trump's plan would raise inflation at a time when high prices are the number one issue facing Americans.

Since Joe Biden became President, inflation has increased by 17.4% in the U.S.
High prices are the biggest issue facing voters and Trump's plan would make the problem worse.
According to Gallup, seven in ten Americans report they ""have had to cut back on, at least, one necessity or nicety in the past six months to meet their monthly expenses.""

The tariffs would hit poor and middle-income Americans the hardest.

Tariffs will raise the prices of food, clothing, consumer electronics, and other necessities.
By increasing the cost of all imports without any thought or discretion, Trump's plan would haphazardly increase the cost of all $3.9 trillion in annual imports.
According to the Heritage Foundation, tariffs disproportionately hurt the poorest Americans because they eat away more of their paychecks than the rich.

Trump's tariffs are flawed foreign policy that would punish our allies and reward adversaries like China.

Trump's plan would indiscriminately weaken our allies around the world with random economic sanctions while isolating our enemies.
Placing a 10% tariff on every country would minimize the impact of current 25% tariffs on China.
Trump's plan would effectively reduce the impact of Chinese tariffs by 40%.

Mike Pence supports free trade with free nations.

Mike Pence has outlined a plan to counter the threat of communist China while supporting our allies abroad.
The Pence plan will also increase economic pressure on China and other regimes until they cease trade abuses, intellectual property theft, and trampling the human rights of their own citizens.

""We want to be the most dominant energy producer in the entire world.""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Ron DeSantis today joined the Mark Levin show. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On his plan to revive American energy dominance:
Yes, we don't want to be relying on foreign countries, but even beyond that, we want to be the dominant energy producer in the entire world. That's important, one, to get prices down at the pump for Americans. Two, it helps the economy overall, because energy costs impact all prices. So it's relief from inflation, it helps small businesses, it helps our industrial base, but maybe most important of all, it helps our national security. Biden's anti-energy agenda benefits Russia, Iran, Venezuela and China. I mean, just think about his push to force people to do electric vehicles. Where does the minerals and the things that they mined, where does that come from to go into the batteries and whatnot? Most of it comes from China, and so it makes Americans more reliant on China. It will totally decimate our automobile industry here at home. We have these minerals, we have reserves. And so I think we should be exporting our natural gas to all these places. Give it to Europe, so that they don't have to worry about any hostile countries. We've got to choose Midland over Moscow when it comes to energy. We've got to choose the Marcellus over the Mullahs. And we've got to choose Bakken over Beijing. If we do all of that, the average American is going to do much better in their pocketbook, and our country is going to be way more secure as a result.
On reducing reckless and wasteful federal spending:
If you look at the problem we've had with the explosion of debt, it's routed back into the COVID response where they did trillions and trillions of dollars. And both parties supported this over the last three, four years, and that's bad, and that shouldn't have happened. And I think the whole response, looking back, we should have never done that. I think most people acknowledge that at this point. Clearly in Florida, we fought back against that very early on. But the problem is, is they've locked in those levels of spending, effectively that were justified because of the of the quote, COVID emergency. You got to go all the way back, set all those spending levels back to what it was prior to that 2017, 2018, 2019 levels, and then you got to hold the line there.
On why he's the left's biggest threat:
I think it's because one, they know that I will beat Joe Biden, but I think much more importantly, they've seen me actually execute on this agenda. We're so used to people running for office, making big promises, and then not following through on what they said they would do. With me, everything I said I would do as governor, I have delivered, and these are big wins on illegal immigration, on education, on economy, on reducing our debt, on and on down the line, things that really, really matter to Floridians and to conservatives nationally, because we've led the way. So they look at me as somebody who in the two-term presidency, you know, I have the strategic judgment, I have the discipline, to be able to bring all this stuff in for a landing. They do not want to see that, you know. They are invested in continuing in the status quo. They don't want somebody that's going to come in and actually get the job done. So they've been really targeting me for many, many years.

Especially in light of the bill we just saw come into place in California that would hand parents custody battles if they don't affirm their children who are transgendering — transitioning. Why do you think that there is a war against parents right now in America?
Tim Scott: Well, there's a war against the family. The bottom line is simple, that the radical forces in this country understand and appreciate if you can attack the kids, breaking the family with the kids, like the breaking the back of the entire most important fundamental component of what makes America the strongest nation on Earth is the family. One of the things God attended to reach in Genesis 1:26, Genesis 2:18, you see the importance of the levy and cleaving and forming a family. And part of the challenge that we see here is that the most vulnerable component of the family are the kids, if you're gonna attack anything, attack it in its infancy. California is attacking our kids. It's evil. I mean, literally taking away parental rights from parents who don't agree with the gender decisions of their kids. It's not wrong only, it's not immoral only, it's evil. That is bad for the country, bad for the soul of this nation, and frankly, it robs the parents of their right to choose and to be responsible for their kids. I can't think of anything that's more anti-biblical than this decision to take away people's kids.

NEW YORK CITY, NY – Today, Tim Scott joined The Big Money Show on FOX Business where he participated in an education town hall to discuss his Empower Parents Plan, the need for nationwide school choice, and how he would bridge the education gap.
WATCH HERE
Audience Member: So my question is about how do you feel about the educational gap between low income students and high income students? Low income students tend to have to work twice as hard. And how do you think we can close that educational gap to ensure that each student has access to the same opportunities?
Tim Scott: Well, thank you. Once again, I started ten years, eight years ago, I started the School Choice Caucus in Congress. I started that because I look back on my education experience as a kid, and one of the things I understand as a kid growing up in poverty, you look at the lowest performing education systems that are typically filled with kids that come from single-parent households and poverty. One of the ways that we level that playing field, is to make sure that every parent has the resources to make the right decision for their educational path for their kid. That's why school choice is so important. Now, one of the ways that we can accomplish that, as President of the United States, there are two major buckets of resources that go to the states. I would make those resources back-packable. In other words, wherever the kid goes, the money will follow. I like to move as you can tell. So let us think about it this way: Title I money is for kids that are going to poor schools, $24 – $30 billion, somewhere in that range. If you put those resources in the backpack for the child, and wherever that child goes, you let those federal dollars follow, you actually end up with higher quality school choice in every state in the nation. And Title II dollars, for those kids with special needs. It is really hard to have the right IEP education plan, for that individual, but if we gave the parents their resources, and allowed them to choose a school like in South Carolina, we have a school called Hidden Treasures that focuses on making sure that every child maximizes their potential. Let's do that nationwide.

NEW YORK CITY, NY – Tonight, Tim Scott joined FOX News' Sean Hannity with a live studio audience to discuss the importance that all Republican candidates stand up for the importance of life.
WATCH HERE
Sean Hannity: Let me move to the controversial issue of abortion. Have you distinguished yourself with some of your fellow candidates. I read it with great interest because I think that the issue politically of abortion, not the moral side of it, although they are probably intertwined, but the political side of it is I think probably the country politically is at the Dobbs decision, 15 weeks, 12 weeks. You said there should be a ban after 15 weeks, states that make the decision say they should go longer than that.
Tim Scott: At 15 weeks a baby can suck his or her thumb, feel pain. Three out of four Americans say 15 weeks is the exact right place to be as it relates to stopping radical states like New York, California and Illinois from having abortion on demand up until the day of birth. That's just wrong. We as a nation, we're better than that. We have to learn to stand up for our rights and make sure every single child in every single state has the same rights, and that means 15 weeks should be a national limit. I want my entire presidential – all the presidential candidates, whether it is Ron, Nikki, the former President, they should support me with a 15-week limit. We can't trust California with anything. Think about this, in California today they will take away a parent's right to their kids if they don't agree with their gender decisions. That's wrong. We should stand up against that.

DeSantis Seeks to Reduce Gas Prices to $2 in 2025
MIDLAND, TX - During an event today in Midland, Texas, Ron DeSantis unveiled a detailed plan for America's path to energy dominance, pledging to reverse Joe Biden's harmful ""Green New Deal"" policies that hurt Americans and strengthen our adversaries. DeSantis will pursue commonsense energy policies to create millions of jobs, crush inflation, reduce gas prices, revitalize our communities, strengthen our economic and national security, and improve our standard of living.
""As President, I will be laser-focused on reducing gas prices and energy costs,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""We will unleash American energy dominance as a way to stop inflation and achieve $2 gas in 2025. We need a pro-America energy policy that puts Midland over Moscow, the Marcellus over the Mullahs, and the Bakken over Beijing. We will reverse American decline by reversing Biden's America last energy agenda, eliminating reliance on hostile nations for energy, and putting the economic interests of Americans before the radical left's ideological agenda.""

National Review: ""Mike Pence Argues for Peace Through Strength, Against Isolationism and Appeasement.""
""'[Trump's] admonition was not to be too tough on China,' an adviser said about the former president's warning to Pence before his 2019 Wilson Center speech. Disregarding his former boss, the former vice president said, 'China is the greatest strategic and economic threat to the United States of America in the 21st century, and we must meet that threat with American strength.'""
The Hill: ""Pence warns against Trump, GOP 'isolationism'.""
""The former vice president, in his speech, argued that holding back U.S. support for Ukraine would embolden China, which he labeled the greater challenge, and further arguing against voices promoting an isolationist America. ""You can either be tough on China, or you can be an isolationist — but you cannot be both,"" he said in his speech."" 
CNN Politics: ""Pence and other 2024 Republicans zero in on China to demonstrate foreign policy chops.""
""When former Vice President Mike Pence delivered an expansive foreign policy speech Monday in which he laid out his vision, bashed President Joe Biden's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, and contrasted his views with those of other Republicans, he started with a focus on one country: China.""

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Iowans Blast Trump for Calling Heartbeat Bills a ""Terrible Thing""",2023-09-19T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-iowans-blast-trump-for-calling-heartbeat-bills-terrible,"
DES MOINES, IA - Ahead of Donald Trump's visit to Iowa on Wednesday, conservative leaders in the Hawkeye State blasted Donald Trump for calling the heartbeat bills passed in both Iowa and Florida a ""terrible thing"" during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press this weekend.
""It is unconscionable that Trump believes he can negotiate innocent babies lives with those who want to terminate them. This is not an ""Art of the Deal"" moment. Life is a right guaranteed from our creator."" - Pastor Mark Doland (Tama County)
""It is disappointing to hear that former President Trump is willing to move toward the left on the issue of abortion in his most recent comments on the subject on Sunday. To call the signing of a bill that bans abortions on the unborn with beating hearts in the first six weeks, 'a terrible thing and a terrible mistake,' is to call good evil and evil good. When it comes to the enactment of ""heartbeat laws,"" I support Governor DeSantis of Florida and all other leaders in other states who are more interested in what is right than what may be perceived as popular."" - Pastor John Vermeer (Lyon County)
""Trump's comments are a slap in the face to Iowans and the entire pro-life movement. We should never compromise with Democrats on protecting life. Trump should be prepared to hear from Iowans on his awful comments for the rest of the campaign."" - House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl
""The Iowa Legislature proudly passed the heartbeat bill because when there is a Heartbeat there is life! President Trump thinks that protecting babies with a Heartbeat is a ""terrible thing"" and that he will compromise on life with the left. In Iowa, we don't compromise on what is right."" - Speaker Pro Tem John Wills
""I could not be more disappointed with President Trump's criticism of Governor DeSantis and Florida's heartbeat law. What I think is a 'terrible thing' is a leader who shrinks away from the opportunity to lead on the issue of life. I'm now left wondering what else he's willing to deal away."" - Pastor and Rep. Jon Dunwell""It's disappointing to hear former President Trump call the heartbeat law 'a terrible thing.' We need someone in the White House who will stand for life and understands that a commitment to life means supporting parents and families before, during, and after pregnancies. That's why I chose to endorse Ron Desantis. He is committed to programs like making baby items tax-free and HOPE Florida which connects needy families with organizations that have resources to give. DeSantis knows that life starts with a heartbeat and to be pro-life requires continuing to walk with parents on their family journey."" - Rep. Devon Wood
""Donald Trump is wrong. Ron DeSantis protecting life in Florida is not a terrible thing. What's terrible is the fact that the left is unwilling to put any limits on when a baby can be murdered. These are the people Trump is saying he will negotiate with. If it's up to AOC, Nancy and Chuck Schumer to help write abortion laws, more babies will die. I'm not willing to let that happen just so Trump can try and get the corporate media and the Left to like him. I stand with Ron DeSantis and protecting life."" - Cody Hoefert, former co-chairman of the Iowa GOP
The Heartbeat Protection Act, signed by Ron DeSantis in April 2023, is the strongest pro-life protection in Florida history and is similar to the legislation passed by the Iowa Legislature and signed by Governor Kim Reynolds in July 2023.

America must return to the path we forged under our administration, stand resolute in defense of our interests and values, even as we reach out our hand to our adversaries in the hope that they will reach back with deeds, not words, and with renewed respect for America,"" concluded Pence.

LISTEN HERE
Simon Conway: Today we got five Americans back. No one is going to be unhappy that these Americans are home. That's a good thing. The bad thing, however, is we paid for them. And I believe that the Biden Administration has now put a price on the back of every American abroad right now. And certainly, if I was in Iran right now and had that passport, I'd be getting out of Dodge.
Tim Scott: Well, speaking of Dodge, and speaking of your comments, I just said exactly the same thing at Fort Dodge at the Pizza Ranch. I said under President Obama, he paid over 400 million dollars in hostage negotiations. This president, six billion dollars. What does that mean? It means that every single American abroad has a higher price tag on their head, and they are now more likely to be taken than ever before because of the dereliction of duty that we're seeing in broad daylight. President Biden failed us miserably. We all celebrate, Simon, the Americans coming home. The price we pay is now more Americans, thousands of Americans abroad are now in greater jeopardy because this President just doesn't get it.

And I know it's something that's important to you and you've been involved in that issue for a long time. What would you do as President to make sure that families and parents have choices for their kids' education?
Sen Scott: I would take the model of Governor Kim Reynolds in this great state and make it a nationwide model. Think about what's happened here. You have a $7,500 tax credit available for everyone within 300% of poverty. Next year, it goes to 400% of poverty. And then the following year it's universal. I would take the two major buckets of resources that come from the federal government Title I money for those kids going to failing or underperforming schools, put that money in a proverbial backpack, and let it follow the kid when the parent has a choice that kids have the best chance for success. And then the second thing I would do is I would put a target on the backs of the teachers' unions and break their backs. They're destroying our kids, trapping them in failing schools. Not on my watch. I will stand in the fire and make sure that kids growing up in poverty, and kids growing up in rural America have quality education as a choice. The good news as Americans: the future is not going to be determined by the color of our skin, but it will be determined by the quality of our education. Let's equip our kids.

(Washington, DC) – Vice President Pence today released his plan to restore the American family in an address at the Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, D.C. From the cost of food to energy to healthcare to housing, American families are having to pay more for less.

""Strong families make for strong communities, and strong communities make strong nations,"" stated Vice President Pence. ""For our civilization to prosper – if we are to pass on the rights, freedoms, and culture we cherish to the next generation – our highest priority must be to preserve, renew and strengthen the families on which our nation is built.""

Protect America's children, especially the unborn;

Click here to watch Vice President Mike Pence's address unveiling his plan to put American families first.
The Pence plan will:

Reduce financial burdens for America's families, including adoption costs.

o The Pence Administration will address the rising costs of healthcare and higher education, which have skyrocketed as a direct result of government interference. As inflation and government spending come down, so too will expenses for American families.
o President Pence will work with Congress to permanently extend and expand tax cuts for middle- and low-income families with children, which are set to expire in 2025.
o High costs associated with adoption in this country often discourage prospective families from choosing adoption. The system needs to be as simple and affordable as possible. Government agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services should work to consolidate the current web of grants, tax incentives, and direct benefits into a mission-focused grant with the goal of providing no or low-cost adoptions to families across the country.

Protect America's children, especially the unborn.

o Mike Pence will work with Congress to pass a 15-week abortion ban to protect unborn children nationwide. This minimum standard is essential to ensure that the lives of unborn children are protected in every state.
o President Pence will also support the adoption of a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to life in our Nation's Constitution.

End the war on traditional family values.

o President Pence will issue Executive Orders directing all federal agencies to defund any programs or entities that accept federal money and provide surgical or chemical sexual reassignment on children in the U.S. or around the world.
o President Pence will also push for a Congressional, national ban on child gender reassignment a priority of his legislative agenda. This ban will ensure that protecting children is the law of the land and cannot be superseded or ignored by radical governors in liberal states.

Advance universal school choice. 

o President Pence will work with Congress to eliminate the unnecessary Department of Education and return that funding and decision-making back to parents.
o The $84 billion currently spent by bureaucrats will be returned to states with the one restriction that states taking federal dollars must grant children the flexibility to use their tax dollars at the school of their choice – public or parochial.

You see the crime, you see high unemployment, and you see the devastation of hopeless environments. Why? Because they've trapped kids in failing schools and hope deferred, makes the heart sick. The devastation can end on day one when we allow choice and competition in our K through 12 education. When parents have a choice, kids have the best chance to succeed. And the thing that stands in the way of our teachers, we must break the backs of teachers' unions by introducing public, private, virtual school choice so that parents get the voice they deserve.

Joe Biden has turned America into a nation of borrowers. Tim Scott has a plan to stop borrowing and start building — so the future is Made in America.
CHARLESTON, SC – Today, Tim Scott unveiled his new economic plan: ""Build. Don't Borrow."" Tim's plan includes stopping runaway government spending and cutting taxes, getting Americans working, and unleashing American manufacturing and energy production with his Made In America agenda.
This Friday, Tim will meet with local business leaders in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to introduce his plan to create opportunity, get Americans working, and reinvigorate the economy. Following that, Tim will share his economic plan with caucus-goers in Iowa for a series of events on Saturday, September 16 and Monday, September 18.
""On Joe Biden's watch, China builds while America borrows. I have a plan to stop borrowing and start building, and create a future Made in America,"" said Tim Scott. ""As President, I will cut socialist government spending, reclaim our supply chains, cut taxes, and unleash American energy. We will lead the world in building, growing, and inventing the future.""
Tim Scott's New Economic Plan: Build. Don't Borrow. 
I. Cutting Spending, Government, and Taxes

Cut non-defense discretionary spending back to the pre-pandemic baseline.
Prevent the Biden Tax Hike, make your personal and family tax cuts permanent, and kill the Death Tax to save family farms. Your money belongs to you, not the IRS.
Move cabinet agency staff out of Washington D.C., end automatic raises for federal bureaucrats, and push money and power back into the Heartland.

II. Get America Working

Rebuild a culture that motivates, inspires, and requires work.
Restore the dignity of work through stronger work requirements and Welfare Reform 2.0.
Stop Biden's student loan socialism for elites and expand the skilled trades instead — through tax cuts, apprenticeships, and expanded Pell Grants.

III. Made in America

Eliminate the Factory Tax and supercharge American manufacturing — by rewarding American businesses that build, not foreign companies that borrow.
Make American energy abundant, cheap, and dominant — by ramping up oil and gas development, expanding ethanol and biofuels, and aiming to double nuclear energy in 10 years.
Champion ethanol and biofuels and support America's farmers who are growing our way toward energy independence.
Defend American agriculture. Stop China from buying up our farmland, protect property rights from liberal regulators, and prevent the IRS from killing family farms.

South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott, a contender in the Republican race for the White House, took aim at American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten on Wednesday after she likened school choice and parental rights advocates to segregationists who opposed the integration of schools.
""There might not be anyone that's done more damage recently than Randi Weingarten to the kids living in distressed communities, especially like the ones where I grew up,"" Scott told Fox News Digital. ""It's so frustrating to hear these liberal lies, hearkening back to a day that no longer exists.""
...
During the interview, Weingarten likened school choice and parental rights advocates to segregationists in the 1950s who had taken issue with the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education, which found it unconstitutional to separate children in public schools on the basis of race.
...
Words like those, according to Weingarten, are used as an ""attempt to divide parents versus teachers.""
""I'm so sick and tired of liberals – too many of them happen to be White – crying racism every single time they're losing an argument,"" Scott said. ""I can't think of anything more actually racist than trapping poor Black kids in the failing schools in these big blue cities dominated by a super-majority of radical progressives who are running the cities and destroying the schools.""
""They're the ones, with their teachers unions, standing in the doorway of the schoolhouse, trapping poor kids in as if the house is on fire, but they won't let a single soul out,"" he went on. ""It's really frustrating, and it's one of the reasons why I think we have no choice but to break the backs of these teachers' unions. They're the problem. They're literally destroying the future of millions of kids.""
If elected, Scott said he would work to break the influence on schools from teachers' unions and provide ""choice in education"" because he believes parents in America ""deserve the choices that they need so that their kids have a chance to succeed.""

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Discusses New Economic Plan On CNBC Squawk Box,2023-09-14T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-discusses-new-economic-plan-cnbc-squawk-box,"
Tim Scott unveiled his new economic plan — Build, Don't Borrow — that will stop runaway government spending, cut taxes, get Americans working, and unleash American manufacturing and energy production.
WASHINGTON, DC–  This morning, Tim Scott joined Squawk Box on CNBC to discuss his new economic plan. Tim's plan will stop borrowing and start building to create a future Made in America. As President, he will accomplish this by cutting government funding, unleashing American energy, and cutting taxes.
WATCH HERE
Joe Kernan: The latest from the Census Bureau, median real income for Americans was $78,250 in 2019 — 2022, it was down almost $4000. We've gotten nowhere. $74,580. What does your plan do to try to reverse that trend?
Tim Scott: Well, one of the things we have to remember is that under Joe Biden, we have 52 consecutive paychecks where our spending power went down. One of the ways that we can increase our spending power is to lower the tax burden on our paychecks. My plan cuts taxes, which requires us to cut spending and cut government as well. So think about the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that I helped write — that provided the average family about $4,400 back in their paychecks. They got to keep their own money. Let's do that again. Let's make those tax cuts permanent, not just let them end in 2025, but let's make them permanent. At the same time, the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a very interesting name for Joe Biden's plan, increase taxes. We have to rescind those tax increases and eliminate the 87,000 IRS agents that will be hired over 10 years, so that we focus more of our attention and our time on the things that encourages and creates economic activity in our nation.

""Families know Bidenomics isn't working — they feel it every day."" -Tim Scott
WASHINGTON, DC — Tim Scott released the following statement today on President Biden's speech on 'Bidenomics' in Largo, Maryland:
""Shameless. President Biden can call his economic plan whatever he wants — it doesn't change the fact that it is disastrous for families and hardworking Americans.
What the American people really deserve is an apology tour — it would be a better use of everyone's time. Families know Bidenomics isn't working — they feel it every day.
That is why as President of the United States, I'll create opportunity, get Americans working, and launch a Made in America agenda that unleashes the next century of economic growth.""
Today, Tim unveiled his new economic plan: ""Build. Don't Borrow."" The plan focuses on stopping runaway government spending, cutting taxes, getting Americans working, and unleashing American manufacturing and energy production with a Made In America agenda.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Responds To The View,2023-09-14T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-responds-the-view,"
""You can be anything in America if you're Black, except conservative."" – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Tonight, Tim Scott joined FOX News' Sean Hannity and responded to the latest outrageous comments made by Sunny Hostin of The View about Tim.
Tim previously joined The View to address the ""dangerous and offensive"" comments from the hosts of the daytime talk show.
WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: The Democrat party and the progressive left are stuck in Jim Crow 1920s and 30s. What they do not want is a Black man who thinks for himself. You can be anything in America if you're Black, except for a conservative. That's why Sunny is so radical and disgusting with her comments. They don't want my life story to be told because it disrupts the lies of the radical left. I can't think of anything more disgusting to watch the Democrat party descend down into the 1920s. Unbelievable.....
Sean Hannity: Alright, so you did go on The View. That worked out I thought very well for you. It was amazing. Joy didn't wanna show up that day, did she?
Tim Scott: Well, she took the day off because listen, when you say something offensive and disgusting, you should be called out in person live. Yes and in color. And so I went on The View and had a serious conversation about the greatness of America. We should all be proud to be Americans and I can't for the life of me understand why the radical left wants a different country. This is the greatest nation on earth. We are the city on the hill. The radical left and the progressives want to sell socialism because they do not believe in the American people. It's time for us to take a stand, whether it's on The View or at the radical left party, it is time to take our message from sea to shining sea.

Tallahassee, FL - The DeSantis for President Campaign today announced its Alabama Chairman, Terry Lathan. Terry Lathan is the former Chairman of the Alabama Republican Party. In 2020, she served as the RNC Convention Permanent Deputy Co-Chair.
Mrs. Lathan said:
""As the longest serving chairman of the Alabama Republican Party since 1985, with decades of grassroots experience, I am proud to endorse Governor Ron DeSantis for our party's nomination for President of the United States.
Through his solid, focused leadership, he has strongly delivered for the people of Florida. Governor DeSantis epitomizes rock solid conservative principles in his actions while fighting insane liberal policies in a statesmanlike manner.
His incredible results are not from words — they are from his actions.
Governor DeSantis is exactly who America needs at this important political crossroad in our nation. And he can win in November!
While we have several gifted and talented candidates, Ron DeSantis is a time-tested warrior who has implemented conservative policy and understands the importance of our military needs. Ron served our nation honorably earning the Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service and the Iraq Campaign Medal in the US Navy as a JAG officer.
We need a levelheaded, time-tested conservative patriot like Ron DeSantis to lead America.
Tried. True. Tested. I encourage Republican voters to consider Governor Ron DeSantis as they decide who to cast their most important votes for in our respective primaries.""

""[Biden] wants to pursue his ideological agenda for his friends. Meanwhile, Americans' standard of living suffers."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today launched his national Faith and Family Coalition along with endorsements from over 70 faith leaders in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina who are joining the effort. DeSantis' Faith and Family Coalition will help spread his message to put 'God over government' as well as build support for the actions he will take as president to defend religious freedom, allow people of faith to flourish, and advance the culture of life.
""As a husband and father, Ron DeSantis is a man of faith and as a leader, he's shown his resolve in defending religious liberty. I am excited to join this Faith and Family Coalition and support Ron DeSantis for president because I know he will execute the same strong leadership in the White House as he's done in Florida: protecting life, defending our right to worship, and defending religious liberties."" - Pastor & Representative Jon Dunwell, Iowa House of Representatives District 38
""A true leader knows that in times of trial, God must be at the center of our lives. During COVID, leftist bureaucrats closed churches and tried to keep us from worshiping, but Ron DeSantis stood against the current and defended religious liberty. That's why I'm proud to support DeSantis for President and to join his National Faith and Family Coalition."" - Pastor Andrew Hemingway, Hill Village Bible Church (New Hampshire)
""Not all politicians say the right things, but I have found Ron DeSantis to articulate the policies I believe in. He is committed to fighting for the unborn, opposing woke ideology, protecting free speech, advocating for school choice and limiting big government. While he does not just say the right things, he has a proven track record of doing the right things. This is why I am proud to support his run for presidency by joining the National Faith and Family Coalition."" - Pastor Michael Jones, Oakwood Baptist Church (South Carolina)

"Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Launches New TV Ads In Iowa: ""Underdog"" & ""Parental Consent""",2023-09-13T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-launches-new-tv-ads-iowa-underdog-parental-consent,"
CHARLESTON, SC –  Tim Scott launched two new ads today ahead of his upcoming events across Iowa. The ads ""Underdog"" and ""Parental Consent"" will be airing in Iowa beginning Wednesday. The ads are part of Tim's latest $8 million ad buy in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Tim Scott will be meeting with caucus-goers this weekend in Iowa. Events include a town hall in Dubuque, a speech at the 23rd Annual Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition Fall Banquet in Des Moines, then events Monday in Ames, Fort Dodge, and Mason City.
WATCH: Underdog
TRANSCRIPT:
TIM SCOTT: I've been an underdog all my life.
Instead of looking for handouts or making excuses, I went to work and earned what I have.
That's the American way.
But Joe Biden and Kamala Harris believe in socialism, and victimhood.
As President, I'll eliminate their liberal spending and strengthen work requirements for welfare…
because if you're able-bodied in America, you work.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because hard work is the price of American citizenship.
WATCH: Parental Consent
TRANSCRIPT:
TIM SCOTT: The radical Left acts like your kids are their kids.
In schools today, rogue adults are changing kids genders behind parents' backs.
Planned Parenthood is performing abortions on teenage girls in secret, and Big Tech is addicting children to social media.
Two powerful words can stop the radical left dead in their tracks: Parental consent.
As President, I'll put moms and dads back in charge.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Ron DeSantis for President Campaign Announces Maine Leadership Team,2023-09-12T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-ron-desantis-for-president-campaign-announces-maine,"
Tallahassee, FL - The Ron DeSantis for President campaign today announced the members of Ron DeSantis' Maine Leadership Team:
Josh Tardy, Former House Republican Leader and a practicing attorney in Bangor, Maine.
Trey Stewart, Maine Senate Republican Leader. Stewart is serving his second term in the Maine Senate representing the constituents of Senate District 2 in southern Aroostook County and northern Penobscot County. He also formerly represented the people of District 147 for two terms in the Maine House of Representatives, where he served as Assistant Republican Leader.
Reagan Paul, Maine State Representative. Paul is a Gen-Z Christian conservative who flipped a blue seat to represent the people of District 37, which includes Winterport, Prospect, Stockton Springs, Searsport, and part of Frankfort.
House Republican Leader Josh Tardy:
""Ron DeSantis' leadership stands out to me like no Republican candidate has before, and that's why I am proud to endorse DeSantis for President. He is truly the only candidate who can defeat Joe Biden and get the job done for Americans with no drama and no excuses.""
Republican Senate Leader Trey Stewart:
""I am endorsing Ron DeSantis for President because he is the fighter we need to lead our Great American Comeback. We have seen Joe Biden do so much damage to this country and hardworking Mainers are struggling under Bidenomics. 2024 is our chance to reverse our nation's decline and Ron DeSantis is the only leader in the race who can do that. I've seen what he's done to make Florida the best state to do business and we need his strong leadership in the White House.""
State Representative Reagan Paul:
""Joe Biden is accelerating America's decline and endangering my generation's future. We need a young, conservative leader in the White House with a fixed moral compass who will fight for the American people again. Ron DeSantis is the only leader who can beat Joe Biden, reverse the decline, and revive America's future. I am proud to endorse him for President.""
DeSantis now boasts over 300 state-level endorsements, more than any other candidate in the race, in an impressive show of the strength and grassroots enthusiasm DeSantis is building across the country.

""There are folks running to be the President of the United States, on our side of the aisle, whether it's Nikki, Vivek, or Ron, who refuse to suggest that we should stop abortions at 15 weeks."" – Tim Scott
WASHINGTON, DC–  This morning, Tim Scott joined FOX & Friends to discuss the importance for all Republican presidential candidates to stand for the unborn and create a culture of life. Tim also spoke on Biden's weakness on the world stage and how we need a president that will defeat China.
WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: 15 weeks, we need a 15 week federal limit that stops crazy states like California, Illinois, or New York from having abortion up until the day of birth. Kamala Harris should be ashamed of herself, of not being able to name a specific week where we say, as a nation, it is our moral obligation to limit abortions at a certain level. 15 weeks is that level. I'd go a step further. However, there are folks running to be the President of the United States, on our side of the aisle, whether it's Nikki, Vivek, or Ron, who refuse to suggest that we should stop abortions at 15 weeks. The truth is that we and our own party cannot have candidates who refuse to join me at a 15 week limit. It is time for us to get serious about creating a culture of life, then winning the hearts and minds of the American people to make it even more conservative. But let's start with 15 weeks. I'd ask my Republican colleagues to join me at 15 weeks.

Statement by Ron DeSantis on Meeting with 9/11 Families,2023-09-11T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/statement-ron-desantis-meeting-with-911-families,"
NEW YORK , NY - Ron DeSantis issued the following statement after meeting this morning with families that lost loved ones on 9/11:
""Today, Casey and I had the honor of joining with families who still bear the scars of the 9/11 terror attacks to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of that dark day. We heard their heart-wrenching stories, the cherished memories of those they lost, and their strong commitment to never forgetting what happened on this hallowed ground twenty-two years ago. September 11, 2001, changed those families and our nation forever.
""And now decades later, we as a nation still owe full transparency and accountability to these grieving families. Yet too many politicians have broken past promises to them, and that is wholly unacceptable.
""The heinous acts of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-conspirators tore at America's heart and fundamentally altered our nation's trajectory. Any plea deal allowing the accused to avoid the harshest penalties and transparency is unconscionable given the loss inflicted by their terrorist acts. While the Biden Administration has allegedly rejected a considered plea deal over the near-term, pressure must remain so that any way forward includes public answers and maximum lawful punishment. Avoiding a public trial denies victims the justice they deserve and allows others to evade scrutiny. I urge the administration to serve justice and send an unequivocal message that such attacks on American lives will never go unanswered.
""Second, I call on President Biden to publicly commit to declassifying the remaining Intelligence Community documents regarding the planning and financing of 9/11, consistent with protecting national security. While over the last three years some progress has been made, a selection of documents and answers remain unclear. As President, I will demand from each agency that they provide a detailed justification for every remaining redaction, and decide, in the interests of transparency, whether the public interest outweighs any potential harm in disclosure before making declassification and public release decisions. I will end the federal government's decades-long abuse of the classification system and will strive to be the most transparent administration in U.S. history.
""Finally, I join in support of the Ensuring Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act introduced in Congress to close loopholes that prevent victims' families from holding foreign sponsors of terrorism accountable. I supported the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act in Congress, which was a crucial step forward. The Ensuring Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act will help realize its full intent so the families can get justice and answers.
""We have shown in Florida that we can rise to the occasion to provide those who lost their lives on 9/11 the respect they deserve. I was proud to sign a measure into law in Florida earlier this year that designates September 11 as ""9/11 Heroes' Day"" and requires history education regarding the significance of that day, including remembering the sacrifice of military personnel, government employees, civilians, and emergency responders who were killed, wounded, or suffered sickness due to the terrorist attacks.
""The pain of 9/11 endures for these families and all of us who remember that day, and its history must be taught for generations to come. Our work is not done until we have fully brought to light all the details surrounding the attacks, and those responsible are held accountable. I will not rest until both are fully achieved. We Must Never Forget.""

Governor Hutchinson was named our nation's first Undersecretary of Homeland Security after the attacks
SAVANNAH, Georgia — Governor Asa Hutchinson released the following statement today in remembrance of the attacks on September 11, 2001. At the time of the attacks, Gov. Hutchinson was serving our nation as the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. He observed and helped coordinate our nation's response in the immediate aftermath. Subsequently, President George W. Bush tapped Gov. Hutchinson to serve as our nation's first Undersecretary of Homeland Security for Border Security.
""September 11th will forever mark a sacred moment in our nation's history. It's a day that calls for our deepest respect and reflection. The enemies of freedom aimed to shatter our spirit by striking at the heart of our national pride. Yet, in the face of adversity, America stood resilient; we raised high our flag and united in purpose. Today, however, our nation faces a different challenge: a divide that threatens our shared values and vision. We must remember that the same spirit that united us post-9/11 can bridge our differences now. The brave souls we lost 22 years ago deserve a nation that stands together, not apart. On this solemn day, let us recommit to the ideals that make America exceptional, ensuring a brighter future for all."" — Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President of the United States of America

""The most important and powerful image are the first responders running into danger, putting their lives at risk – American exceptionalism at its best."" – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC –  Today, Tim Scott joined FOX News' America Reports to remember the nearly 3,000 lives that were lost and the heroism from first responders and Americans who ran into the face of danger on 9/11.
WATCH HERE
John Roberts: Let me get you to react. First of all, to the fact that President Biden will be the first American president since 9/11 to not visit either Ground Zero or Shanksville or the Pentagon to commemorate the day. Instead, he's gonna be at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, which is a typical refueling stop for Air Force One on its way back from an Asia trip. He couldn't make it back from Hanoi in time. You okay with that? Should he have left earlier to be here? What do you think?
Sen Scott: Here's a day that we should remember as a day of American exceptionalism, 3,000 lives lost, but the most important and powerful image are the first responders running into danger, putting their lives at risk – American exceptionalism at its best. I would've wished the President would've been at the Pentagon talking to and celebrating people willing to lay their lives down for their country. The plane should have left early enough to have been there at the Pentagon talking about American exceptionalism and why America continued to provide opportunities and to be the beacon of light, the city on the hill, but once again, President Biden is missing in action.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Ron DeSantis today joined Laura Ingraham live after attending the 9/11 Memorial and Museum's 22nd Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony, where he met with families who lost loved ones because of the terrorist attacks. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On his visit to NYC to commemorate the 22nd Anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks:
My wife and I got invited by some of the 9/11 families who we've gotten to know, and so we went. I wasn't in the VIP section with these politicians. I was walking around the site with the families. We would go to where their family member's names were, and it was really emotional, because they're telling stories. The way they've done it is, someone that passed away, the names of people that knew each other [are] close by, so they're telling stories about maybe their father's friends or husband's friends, and so my wife and I were really touched by it. And we are committed. And I also think back to 9/11, that inspired me to join the military. I mean, my whole life changed as a result of that--serving in Iraq, serving in the Navy, and ending up getting involved in public service, and so my wife and I were really touched by it. And I've said, as president, you know, they've been promised the documents on the Saudi involvement. They've been promised a lot of things over the year. We got to deliver for these 9/11 families, and I will do that.
On how he will earn the support of minority voters:
I think the formula is, one, don't pander to people and try to divide them on ethnicity. Treat them and us as Americans. We all want the same things. Low crime--we will crack down on crime nationally with the Soros-backed prosecutors. I did it in Florida, I'll do it nationally. The border and immigration, illegal immigration, is having a devastating effect on a lot of these urban areas. People are flooding their school systems and hospitals. I'm going to shut the border down. We'll build a wall and we're going to use lethal force against the Mexican drug cartels, leaving them stone cold dead at the border if they're trying to bring fentanyl in. And then education, we're doing school choice in every inner city in this country. We did it in Florida. Our results have skyrocketed over the last decade as a result of that. It works, and these kids deserve a chance.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Another Weekend in the Hawkeye State,2023-09-09T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-another-weekend-the-hawkeye-state,"
Ron DeSantis attended the Cy-Hawk Game with Governor Kim Reynolds 
Tallahassee, FL - Another Saturday in Iowa was well-spent for Ron DeSantis. From meeting with police officers and fire fighters to attending the famed Iowa vs Iowa State game with Governor Kim Reynolds, DeSantis visited three more counties in this swing through the state as a special guest of Never Back Down, bringing his total to 56. The trip comes the same morning as DeSantis' op-ed supporting Iowa farmers was published in the Des Moines Register. Read the op-ed here.
DeSantis started off the morning with a stop at Natural Grind in Grundy County to have coffee with caucus-goers.
Then, DeSantis attended the 145th Annual Iowa Firefighter's Association Convention in Hardin County.
The rest of the day was spent at the famed Cy-Hawk Game, where DeSantis attended a tailgate with the Iowa Corn Growers Association and became an associate member of the group.
He then headed over to a tailgate hosted by Veterans on Duty and the Bastion Institute with Senator Joni Ernst, and then to the Iowa State Westling Club's tailgate.

""This government is spending way too much money. They've locked in the COVID-era levels of spending, which are totally unsustainable.""
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino live on Fox News' America's Newsroom. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On how Congress should use the power of the purse to hold out-of-control federal agencies accountable:
This government is spending way too much money. They've locked in the COVID-era levels of spending, which are totally unsustainable. So they should absolutely have a big fight over righting that ship. But then you also have the issue of--they're funding really bad policies. So for example, Biden's border policies are causing a massive influx of illegal aliens. They're causing a massive influx of fentanyl, human trafficking, sex trafficking. The Department of Justice and the FBI with the weaponization--when there's memos circulating, targeting observant Catholics as potential terrorists, when the FBI has targeted parents going to school board meetings, the power of the purse is really the way that you hold those agencies accountable. So some of the guys in the House like Chip Roy, who are raising the alarm about this, I think are right. And I think part of the reason our bureaucracy is so out of control, and this deep state has developed like this is because Congress has not been willing to use the power of the purse to discipline these agencies.
On how he kept Florida free and open during COVID:
I think it was pretty clear early on in COVID that Fauci was misfiring. He was elevated to where his pronouncements were basically viewed as gospel around the country. And we rejected that. And we fought when we reopened the state. He criticized us when we had kids in school, first state in the country to have all school districts. He criticized us when we said no vaccine mandates, they criticized that. So we had to chart the course. And obviously, the results speak for themselves because people flooded into Florida. Those first few weeks, we followed some of the federal guidelines. I've always said that. But then I was looking at the data myself. And I made the decision that we were going to chart a separate course. And so we did that. And clearly Florida boomed as a result, but I would note this because this is important, you know, Donald Trump's reelection campaign in October of 2020 was running ads bragging with Fauci saying, 'Trump did everything I told them to do.' They were putting that out, they were bragging about it. And then on January 19 2021, Donald Trump's last day as president, he gave Fauci a Presidential commendation. So those were wrong to do that.
On how he'll fight COVID authoritarianism as President:
Looking forward, we need accountability for what went wrong because those people in positions of authority at the CDC, Fauci--though they lied about lockdown school closures, mask mandates--they were wrong. It did a lot of damage around this country. And I know that because, the people that were harmed, a lot of them came to Florida and would tell us about it. So we need a reckoning so that this never happens to our country again, and we instituted permanent protections in Florida against mask mandates, against all this stuff. People said, 'Oh, you're talking about old issues.' Well you see they're trying to bring it back. Montgomery County, Maryland School District, forcing students to wear KN95 masks during the school day. We know that doesn't work. So we've got to clear house in these medical bureaucracies. We need evidence-based medicine, not narrative-based policies.

""When you have a crisis situation, the important thing is to get it right. Don't worry about the political ramifications."" 
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined Adam Sexton on WMUR's The Pulse of New Hampshire.
""If you're a cartel drug runner, and you've got a satchel full of fentanyl strapped to your back, that is a hostile act because you are invading this country with deadly poison that is killing tens of thousands of people every year,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""And it's not just a border issue. I mean, you guys in New Hampshire have had to deal with the fentanyl overdose crisis""
Watch the segment on WMUR HERE.
Ron DeSantis also joined Michael Graham on the New Hampshire Journal Podcast to talk about his initial response to COVID as Governor of Florida and his plans to end medical authoritarianism as President. Listen to the full episode HERE.
On how he charted his own course on COVID as Governor:
I think when you have people that are putting things out there, and then they're not willing to justify why they're doing it, and when you when you had people speaking out like Jay Bhattacharya from Stanford, my Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who was then at UCLA before I brought him in here--they were getting pilloried by these other scientists and doctors. And I'm just thinking to myself, ""Well, wait a minute. They're raising concerns about this. You won't even debate them?"" Remember, big tech was taking down articles that were critical of lockdowns. Big tech was taking down articles that said this came from the Wuhan Institute of Technology. So yeah, part of it is I had an obligation as the governor. I was the only one that actually got elected in the executive branch to look at the data myself. And yes, I can listen to these bureaucrats and I can take in their information, but I ultimately have to make the judgments. I was very hungry for data, very hungry for information, and that obviously proved to be something that benefited our state.
On why his decisions benefitted Florida:
Yes, this virus is important, and I never downplayed COVID. I mean, I knew it was an issue. But that's not even close to the sum total of just the health consequences, because the lockdown policies hurt people's health in other ways that no one wanted to talk about. Then, you have to look at education. Then, you have to look at the social order. Then, you have to look at the economy and you got to find a way to bring that in that's ultimately going to produce the best outcomes. And what I can say with Florida is, we had lower excess mortality than every state in the Sunbelt, including California, and our economy performed better than any large state in the country over this period of time.
On putting service over self-interests:
When you have a crisis situation, the important thing is to get it right. Don't worry about the political ramifications. I was totally willing to have this be the end of my administration and potentially not get reelected in 2022 if it meant doing the right thing for the state of Florida. I was at peace with that. I just was not going to contort myself into doing things that I didn't think were right because I was worried about the political fallout.
On the Trump Administration's COVID response:
He said for years how great of a job I've done as governor and how great a job Florida has done and how other states should be doing [what Florida was doing]. He ran his reelection campaign and when he came down to Florida, he said, ""You guys didn't close. You guys did it, right. You're open,"" and all this stuff. And now, he's singing a different tune. That's just because he views me as a threat. He knows what he's saying is not true. That's just how he operates. I will note though, it's interesting for the record, his White House Task Force would send these missives down to the states about what they needed to do. And they would send them, summer of 2020, fall of 2020 and even January of 2021, mere weeks before Trump left office, they would send missives to Florida saying, you need to impose a mask mandate and you need to close businesses. They were telling me to close businesses, Deborah Birx and her task force in January of 2021. And so, he [Trump] gave an interview today, with Hugh Hewitt, where he said that he couldn't fire Fauci. And that is not true. He put Fauci on the Task Force; he deferred to Fauci. Those policies coming from his task force were Fauci. He could have removed him from the task force at any time and he did not do it.

Op-Ed by Tim Scott In The Hill: My Plan To Empower Parents,2023-09-08T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/op-ed-tim-scott-the-hill-my-plan-empower-parents,"
Tim ScottThe HillSeptember 8, 2023
Back-to-school should be a season of excitement and optimism for families. But this year, too many parents are worried and anxious.
One big worry is learning loss and academics. Our government K-12 schools spend twice as much per pupil as we did back in the 1960s, but kids are retaining less and less. Reading, math and standardized test scores are the lowest we've seen in decades. Fewer than one-in-three eighth graders can read at grade level.
Then there is the staggering, underdiscussed crisis in youth mental health. Youth depression and suicidal behavior had already skyrocketed before the Covid lockdowns made things even worse. One physician recently said her ER has gone from seeing 30 kids a month for emergency psychiatric issues to 30 every single day. Some of the patients are as young as six. What is happening in a country and a culture where kindergarteners need professional treatment for anxiety and depression?
And millions of families of faith feel they are being targeted and under siege. The radical left is bringing an aggressive culture war to the doorsteps of families who just want to be left alone. Catholic, evangelical, Orthodox, Jewish and Muslim parents are watching their tax dollars spent on lessons and library books that contradict their deepest beliefs and deny basic truths about human nature that everybody agreed on until just recently.
These circumstances call for an all-out campaign to champion, support and empower parents.
...
The good news is that the solutions are simple. I have a plan to protect kids and empower parents throughout our society — from the classroom to the locker room to the smartphone.
...
I am living proof of the amazing power of parenting. I was blessed with grandparents and a mother who prayed for me, molded my character and passed down priceless lessons.
I will use the Oval Office to turn the far left's war on parents upside-down. I'll give 21st-century parents 21st-century tools and solutions and empower them in every way possible.
We need to give every family a choice and every parent a voice so that every child has a chance.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Ron DeSantis on Iowa Television Ahead of Another Weekend in the Hawkeye State,2023-09-08T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-ron-desantis-iowa-television-ahead-another-weekend-the,"
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis joined KCCI's Amanda Rooker and Iowa News Now's Skylar Tallal ahead of another busy weekend in Iowa. The highlights are below.
Watch the KCCI interview HERE.
On attending the Iowa vs. Iowa State (Cy-Hawk) Game:
My plan is to go. I think it's a unique experience to be able to do a rivalry game like that, so we plan on being there and having a good time. I think we're going to do other stops and other counties throughout the day. I think we're at 53 counties you know, and we'll be able to add a number of other counties, but the game is going to be part of our travels that day.
On campaigning in Iowa and his goal to complete the ""Full Grassley"":
We are working from the bottom up to compete in all 99 of Iowa's counties. So far, I have visited 53 of the 99 counties. We're going to be able to knock out a few on this weekend's visit when we come up, and then we will knock out the balance of those in the ensuing months. We're looking forward to doing that, and I think you have to do it. I think one of the reasons that people get inspired to go out to caucus is because you came to their community, you shook their hand, you answered their questions--and that's what we're doing. We've been doing it and we're going to continue to do it. I do think a greater percentage of Iowans are going to start paying closer attention as we get deeper into the fall and into the winter months.
On why he's the parents' candidate:
I'm a parent of young kids ages six, five and three. Our three-year-old just started pre-k3. We've got my son, who is in kindergarten, and our oldest daughter is in first grade. We are very sensitive to what parents are going through, raising kids in this day and age, and we want to ensure that people understand we believe in parents' rights to direct the education and upbringing of their kids. We are insistent that parents have a seat at the table over these important education issues. That's something that Iowa's done a good job of under Governor Reynolds. It's something that we've done a good job of in Florida under my administration, but it's something that really should be a principle that applies nationwide. So, I am the parents' candidate. I'm the candidate that's done the most to stand up for parents and protect our children, and I'm the one that is most in tune with what parents are going through in this day and age.
Watch the Iowa News Now interview HERE.
On standing up for parents' rights and stopping the indoctrination of children:
In Florida, we've protected parents' rights, but that is not universally respected around the country, unfortunately. Parents have the right to direct the education and upbringing of their kids. That means school choice, that means curriculum transparency, that means parents are involved and have a seat at the table about what goes on in the school systems. It's very, very important. The more the parents are involved, the better the students will do. I think if you asked most teachers, [they would say that] the hardest students to reach are the ones where the parents are disengaged from the child's performance. When the parents engage, it helps the teachers be able to get the students to perform at their potential. Why would you not want parents involved? I think the people that don't want the parents involved view the parents as an impediment to using the schools to impose their agenda on the kids. That's not the appropriate thing for the schools. The schools should focus on traditional education. We should not be talking about political indoctrination.
On his proven record of leadership and service over self:
I started out by working minimum wage jobs. I'm a blue-collar kid. I come from a blue-collar family. I had opportunities because I worked hard to get ahead financially, but I decided to join the US military, the Navy, and I volunteered to serve in Iraq. I think people and Iowans appreciate candidates who put service above self, and I'm somebody that's been able to do that. I have a record of demonstrated leadership. All these important issues that we talk about, a lot of this stuff we talked about at that debate in Milwaukee, I've actually accomplished all of that in the state of Florida. From fighting illegal immigration, to supporting second amendment, to running big budget surpluses and paying down our state debt to doing school choice, to doing parents' rights, to protecting people against COVID authoritarianism and vaccine mandates--we've done all of those things in the state of Florida, and I think Republican voters, particularly Iowans, you know, I think they think talk is cheap. I think they want you to show them why you're the leader that they can trust, and I have that demonstrated track record of being a strong leader that differentiates me from the other folks that are running.

Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Jesse Watters on Fox News' Jesse Watters Primetime. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On rejecting the left's COVID authoritarianism:
You have school districts in Maryland now imposing KN-95 mask mandates on school children. Are you kidding me? We know that doesn't work. We know that's harmful. I can tell you, in the state of Florida, we obviously fought back against all that when it was happening. But we've enacted permanent protections. You have a civil right, as a Floridian, to breathe clean air without someone telling you to put on a mask--whether it's your business you go into, whether it's a government agency, nothing. No mask mandates, no mandates on school children, no COVID vax mandates, and we've even banned gain of function research. I think part of the problem with this is a lot of these leftists, they think that these lockdown policies worked. They did not work. And nobody's been held accountable from Fauci on down. I've promised to bring a reckoning to CDC, NIH, FDA, all these agencies that lied to the American people repeatedly because if we don't have a reckoning, if we don't have accountability, they are going to try to do it again. And that's exactly what you see in some of these jurisdictions around the country. We all have to rise up as Americans and just say no.
On holding the medical establishment accountable:
You take something like an FDA, they're basically a subsidiary of Big Pharma. We're not going to allow people in the FDA to leave the FDA and cash out in pharma. It's like a revolving door. That's why you have them approving an mRNA vax for six-month-old babies for COVID. There was no evidence to support that. They're doing it because of that relationship. We're going to clean house at places like the CDC. They didn't follow the science during COVID, they followed the narrative during COVID, and that was very, very destructive. So we will clean house with personnel. You're going to have people in with me like my Surgeon General in Florida, Dr. Joseph Ladapo. You'll have people like Jay Bhattacharya from Stanford. These are people that were right about COVID from day one. They were pilloried by a very politicized scientific establishment, but they stood their ground, and they've been proving right. Those are the people that need to be in positions, not the political actors that we've seen over the last four or five years.
On his plan to stop the invasion and secure our border:
When I first became governor, we banned sanctuary cities. And you know what a lot of these weak-kneed Republicans said? They said that Latino voters were going to rebel against us because we did that. Guess what? In any poll that was ever done, Hispanics in Florida supported us banning sanctuary cities, more than any other demographic. When we've sent troops to the border to help Texas, we've had strong support across the state, especially with our Hispanic community. And when we transported the illegal aliens to beautiful Martha's Vineyard, the Venezuelans down in Florida were very supportive of that. So people want the rule of law. And I would say particularly Hispanic Americans want the rule of law. All those liberal politicians that you just showed, they're articulating why you can't have open borders. They're doing it in a way that may be a little bit more politically correct than they should be, but they are articulating open borders as a disaster. You're seeing what's happening in New York City. Just think of what's happening at these border towns. Think of all the fentanyl that's pouring in. Think of the sex trafficking and the human trafficking. We have a president that's ceded control of our southern border to the Mexican drug cartels. It's humiliating as a country to see this happening, and it is wrong. And we have got to be strong to say we will reverse all of these policies.
On his vision to reverse Bidenomics:
Under Biden, people are hurting and his policies are driving your grocery bills to be more expensive, your gas is going up, and he just took a lot of oil out of circulation in Alaska. His vision is $5, $6, $7 a gallon gas. My vision is open up energy, let's be energy dominant, and let's get back to $2 a gallon gas. That's what the American people need.

The Hill by Lauren Sforza
A new poll from CNN is providing bad news for the White House and President Biden, who scores just a 39 percent approval rating a little more than a year before Election Day.
Sixty-one percent disapprove of Biden's job performance in the poll, and his approval rating is down from 45 percent in CNN's polling at the beginning of the year.
The poll also finds former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the only GOP presidential candidate who is leading in a hypothetical matchup with Biden.
The CNN poll, conducted by SSRS, found that Haley led Biden 49 percent to 43 percent, while every other major Republican candidate remains neck-and-neck with him.
Those results are good news for Haley, a former United Nations ambassador under President Trump who is looking to build on a strong performance in the first GOP presidential debate late last month to challenge her former boss for the Republican nomination.
Haley is far behind Trump in polls of Republican primary voters, however, underscoring the uphill climb she faces.
Still, the CNN poll suggests she'd be a better general election GOP nominee against Biden than her competition — a potential talking point as she makes her case in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early primary and caucus states.
A couple other GOP candidates were ahead of Biden in the CNN head-to-head polling.
Former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) both won 46 percent support to Biden's 44 percent support in head-to-head matchups.
Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won 44 percent to Biden's 42 percent, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was tied with Biden, with each getting 47 percent.
Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy was behind Biden in a head-to-head matchup, 45 percent to 46 percent, while Trump held a 1-point advantage of 47 percent to 46 percent.
When asked about a potential rematch between Trump and Biden, 47 percent of respondents said they would choose the former president, and 46 percent said they would choose the current president; 5 percent said they would choose a different candidate, and 2 percent said they did not plan to vote.
None of those figures are good for Biden, who ends up trailing five of the seven GOP candidates in the polling.
A big hangup for voters with Biden appears to be the president's age. Biden is 80 and will turn 81 in November.
More than half of the Democratic voters polled are ""seriously concerned"" about his age, according to the CNN poll.
About 60 percent of Democrats expressed concern about Biden's ability to win the 2024 election if he clinches the Democratic nomination. Another 62 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of all respondents said they are seriously concerned about Biden completing a second term.
Biden is almost certain to win the Democratic nomination. His two main primary challengers are Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Marianne Williamson, who have not won party support and are far behind him in polls.
But Biden's weakness in the poll is likely to increase Democratic anxieties over his strength as a candidate next year.
The poll found that 46 percent of voters surveyed said any Republican presidential nominee would be better than Biden in next year's election, while 32 percent said the sitting president would be a better choice than any of the GOP hopefuls.
In comparison, 44 percent said that any Democratic nominee would be better than Trump, while 38 percent say the former president is better than any Democratic nominee.
Among Democrats, the poll discovered that 67 percent would like to see the party nominate someone other than Biden — which is up from the 54 percent who said the same in March.
Out of those who would like to see a different candidate, 82 percent said they did not have any specific person in mind. Just 1 percent said that they would vote for either of Biden's 2024 Democratic challengers: Williamson or Kennedy, Jr.
The poll was conducted by SSRS from Aug. 25-31 among 1,259 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
Biden is headed to India on Thursday for the G20 summit and will return to Washington at the beginning of next week.
While the poll will give Republicans confidence in beating Biden, they will have their own worries about Trump, the subject of two federal indictments in addition to other state charges.
Those legal fights have seemed to strengthen, not weaken, the former president when it comes to the fight for the GOP nomination. But the polling raises questions already in the minds of many GOP voters about whether he would be a weak general election candidate in the fall of 2024.

DeSantis Vows to ""Usher in A Reckoning"" of Accountability on Those Who Pushed Draconian COVID Policies He Blasted the Trump White House COVID Task Force for 2021 letter pressuring Florida to impose COVID mandates and restrictions
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – In the wake of the left's recent push to bring back COVID mandates and medical authoritarianism, Ron DeSantis today held a press conference in Jacksonville, Florida where he vowed to fight back and bring a reckoning to the biomedical establishment.
""I will usher in a reckoning for those who devised the failed and destructive biomedical policies that caused damage throughout our country, because until there is accountability they will try to do it again,"" said Ron DeSantis.
During the event, DeSantis also highlighted how he rejected pressure from the Trump administration to force COVID-19 mandates in Florida.
""For months, May of 2020, summer of 2020, fall of 2020, even January of 2021, I was getting hit by the White House Task Force under Trump,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""This wasn't even Biden, this was Trump. January of 2021, weeks before he left office, they were sending us missives to Florida saying 'impose a mask mandate and close bars and restaurants and businesses.' And that's what they were pushing. And that was pretty much uniform throughout the political and bureaucratic sphere, and it was driven by people like Fauci with no regard for what that might mean for people's livelihoods. And so we had to be the ones to stand in the breach on that, and I just look at somebody like Fauci, you know, part of the problem with our country is that bureaucrats like him have been coddled, they've been put on a pedestal. I think the way you treat bureaucrats like Fauci is, you tell the 'you're fired. Get lost.' That's what you need to be doing.""

Trump White House urged DeSantis in letter to reimplement masking in Florida
Washington Examiner
Julia Johnson
September 7, 2023
Former President Donald Trump's administration told Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) to reinstitute masking and social distancing in Florida in 2021, months after the governor had reopened the state.
In a letter obtained by the Washington Examiner, Trump's White House Coronavirus Task Force warned DeSantis's administration that ""aggressive mitigation must be used,"" including ""uniform implementation"" of 2-3-ply well-fitting masks and ""strict physical distancing.""
A new rise in COVID-19 cases has prompted calls to reinstate masking and other mitigation measures, which in turn has renewed the debate over which Republican handled the initial virus response better.
DeSantis had lifted all COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and restaurants in Florida and banned fines for not wearing a mask in September 2020, months prior to the letter.
In a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday, Trump slammed DeSantis's COVID-19 handling, saying, ""He shut down Florida. It was tight as a drum. He had vax lines. He was vaxxing everything. Now, he talks about the vaccinations this and that.""
But in the letter sent to Florida from Trump's task force, DeSantis was told, ""Do not delay the rapid immunization of those over 65 and vulnerable to severe disease.""
It further advised ""active and aggressive immunization.""
The letter also instructed the state on ""maintaining public confidence and maximizing vaccine acceptance"" to address ""persistent vaccine-hesitancy.""
During Trump's interview, he further told Hewitt, ""[DeSantis] said he wouldn't let anybody come in. He shut down his beaches. He shut down the entire state.""
""He has a selective memory,"" Trump continued. ""He shut down. [Gov.] Henry McMaster didn't shut down South Carolina. [Gov.] Kristi Noem didn't shut down South Dakota.""
However, the Trump administration's report to DeSantis advised in January 2021, ""Florida must increase both statewide and local public mitigation. Increase communication around the importance of personal mitigation with masking, physical distancing, and avoiding family gatherings.""
Despite pressure from Trump's White House and its medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, DeSantis did not reimplement COVID-19 measures and fought off mask mandates in schools later in the year.
Trump's campaign did not provide comment to the Washington Examiner.
As the pandemic subsided, Florida was praised by the Right for his COVID-19 response, wherein he emphasized individual freedoms and stood against mandates. His response paid off, because in the midterm elections, he sailed to a landslide reelection, carrying Republican candidates across the state to their own electoral wins.
The issue hasn't been a significant talking point in the 2024 primary campaign because COVID-19 has generally been dismissed due to its diminishing prevalence. But now, cases are on the rise. In fact, first lady Jill Biden contracted the virus this week, prompting the president to begin masking indoors despite testing negative. Talk of safety protocols such as masking and social distancing has been renewed, with Fauci recently telling CNN, ""I am concerned that people will not abide by recommendations.""
""I would hope that if we get to the point that the volume of cases is such and organizations like the CDC recommends, CDC does not mandate anything, recommends that people wear masks, I would hope that people abide by that recommendation and take into account the risks to themselves and their families,"" he said.
DeSantis's 2024 campaign is hoping to use the new discussion around COVID-19 to point to his record on the subject, which was popular among Floridians.
On Wednesday, the governor posted a video on social media highlighting his response to the virus, telling viewers that if elected, ""I will usher in a reckoning for those who devised the failed and destructive biomedical policies that caused damage throughout our country, because until there is accountability they will try to do it again.""

"Hutchinson Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: New Hampshire, Please Consider Asa Hutchinson",2023-09-07T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/hutchinson-campaign-press-release-icymi-new-hampshire-please-consider-asa-hutchinson,"
by Scot Lehigh of The Boston Globe
I wanted to take a moment to flag for you a column from The Boston Globe authored by Mr. Scot Lehigh. Entitled ""New Hampshire, Please Consider Asa Hutchinson,"" Mr. Lehigh shares his thoughts from an on-the-record roundtable discussion with the opinion and editorial staff of The Boston Globe during a recent swing through New Hampshire. His column is full of important takeaways for Republican primary voters including insights such as: ""If he doesn't make the debate stage, it will not just be the GOP's loss but the country's as well. Hutchinson is a serious, principled conservative, one whose focus is economic and fiscal issues, smaller government, and a traditional internationalist foreign policy. That is, the type of Republican New Hampshire has traditionally gravitated toward."" 
You can read Mr. Lehigh's column by clicking here. Additionally, in case you missed some other recent comments regarding Governor Asa Hutchinson from around the country, please see the compiled quotes from recaps of the first RNC Presidential Primary Debate.
Here are what others had to say about Governor Hutchinson's performance at the first RNC Presidential Primary Debate:
""Hutchinson barely met the criteria to make the stage in Milwaukee — but once there, he used the evening to establish himself as a figure one could actually imagine as president of the United States. Mature, measured, and thoughtful, Hutchinson highlighted an Arkansas record that should appeal to results-oriented conservatives. He spoke positively and optimistically about bringing out the best in the country...Hutchinson was, in short, who most fit with the mold of a modern Ronald Reagan."" —Scot Lehigh, The Boston Globe
""My God. He is going to run as Asa Hutchinson. Asa Hutchinson took the stage Wednesday night at the Fox News debate and showed the nation who he is: the adult in the room...Asa Hutchinson answered the questions put to him, showed off his extensive resume, and gave people an eight-year history lesson of Arkansas during his administration. He might have said, 'Now wait a minute,' when one of the other candidates said all of the others on stage were bought and paid for, but he didn't exactly jump out of his shoes. Asa Hutchinson doesn't jump out of his shoes. Now we wait to see if that kind of adulting will do the trick...if folks want Mike Pence's resume, Ron DeSantis' administrative record, Chris Christie's move-on crusade, and Nikki Haley's (mostly) soothing demeanor, Asa Hutchinson would be the man. He's not going to insult anybody, change his principles to meet the moment, or develop another personality on the fly."" — The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Editorial Board
""Even though he didn't get much air time at the Republican presidential debate Wednesday, he accomplished what he needed to do: He made it to the stage, and he differentiated himself from other candidates...Hutchinson distinguished himself in two ways. His big moment came when the Fox News moderators asked who would still support former President Trump, who was not at the debate, if he were convicted in court. Debate participants were required to sign a pledge that they will support the nominee whoever that is. Trump did not sign it...When the candidates had to make a spur-of-the-moment decision, Hutchinson was the one who stood the strongest on his convictions. Maybe some of the party's anti-Trump activists and donors took note. The other way Hutchinson distinguished himself was by not getting involved in a lot of the squabbling back and forth among the other candidates. It meant he didn't get as much air time, but it reinforced his selling point as the drama-free adult in the room."" — Steve Brawner, Independent Arkansas
""Governor Hutchinson cut through with competence and clarity at the debate. He isn't looking over his shoulder, he isn't following the pack—he's a leader, and he knows why he's in this race. It is critical that Republican voters hear his message—and he has the conservative record and experience to actually put runs on the board if he wins."" — Heath Mayo, Founder of Principles First
""Governor Hutchinson demonstrated his dedication to the Constitution that has been the foundation of his public service for years. With zero hesitation, he stood unwaveringly alone and ramrod straight when the topic of potentially supporting a convicted felon and constitutionally ineligible candidate came up. It was not lost on me his subtle acknowledgment of Israel by donning a U.S./Israel flag lapel pin, which starkly contradicts the ill-conceived policies of Donald Trump's favorite surrogate, Vivek Ramaswamy. If the GOP is serious about winning elections rather than catering to the extremes, then Asa Hutchinson is one of the better candidates and a serious contender for the Republican nomination."" — Olivia Troye, former Bush and Trump administrations national security official and current national security consultant
""Governor Hutchison used the debate as an opportunity to introduce himself to a national audience and draw attention to his substantial background at the highest level of government. His extensive background in law enforcement and border security is particularly timely. He is offering experience and integrity and running as a Reagan conservative. Voters learned more about him on debate night than ever before."" — Matt Mackowiak, Texas-based GOP consultant
""In Iowa, Governor Hutchinson is receiving very high praise for his conduct at the first debate. His demeanor was a welcome relief from the screaming match the debate devolved into. If you are looking for soundbites and shrill voices, look downstage. If you want to restore dignity to the office of the Presidency and for clear-eyed, pragmatic solutions to the complex issues facing America, look no further than Governor Hutchinson. I would expect the same at the next debate. If the winner of these debates is determined by who shouts the loudest and talks the longest rather than the individual who is truly prepared to lead our country, then thankfully that is not the contest Governor Hutchinson is interested in winning."" — Tim Coonan, Asa for America Iowa State Chair
""Governor Hutchinson offered up specific policy solutions and demonstrated an unwavering respect for the rule of law. Hutchinson provides our best opportunity to build a broad coalition of voters in the general election and bring conservative leadership back to the White House."" — Timothy Gilliam, Asa for America Kentucky State Chair
""Americans tuned into the first RNC Presidential Primary debate looking for a leader ready to do the job on day one. By remaining above the fray, Governor Hutchinson demonstrated to the American people that he has the temperament, resolve, and resume to serve as President of the United States of America. The Republican presidential primary is serious and should be treated as such. The American people are interviewing individuals to be the next leader of the free world, not a contestant on a reality show. Governor Hutchinson showed the American people that he takes this job seriously and is prepared to offer serious answers to questions. He will not disrespect voters or the highest office in our nation by participating in a shouting contest. When choosing who to support for president, the American people will appreciate that."" — Rob Burgess, Asa for America Campaign Manager

CHARLESTON, SC - Tim Scott's mother, Frances Scott, joined FOX News' Harris Faulkner to discuss Tim's journey, her experience raising children as a single mother, and how she is giving back and supporting single mothers in the Low Country.

WATCH HERE
Harris Faulkner: If your son makes it to the White House, is there something that you want him particularly to focus on?
Frances Scott: People who don't have. I think it's just important that if we have a president who's able to help people, help other people succeed in their life. Sometimes life can be hard, but if you have someone who can understand and who've also been there to understand that life is hard and to help them push them on, but only in America that this can be done for my daddy to be a part of the journey that brought Tim to be the US Senator. That's very important.
Harris Faulkner: What about that journey makes that matter so much?
Frances Scott: Cause at one time, that was impossible. And for him to witness that, to see it and be a part of it, it meant a lot.
Harris Faulkner: So many lives you've touched. That's an entire lifetime right there. And so how do you fill that, that energy, that void?
Frances Scott: How do I fill it now, with my foundation, it's called Raising up the Low Country Foundation geared towards working single moms. And I love it.
Harris Faulkner: If there is a single mom out there who's struggling right now, what would you say to her?
Frances Scott: I would tell her to keep the faith. If you're not a believer, become a believer. 'cause God will take you through this journey. It doesn't last forever. It is only temporarily. Keep focused, stay focused. I would like to say and keep on keeping on. Don't stop.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis' Exclusive Interview with Kayleigh McEnany,2023-09-06T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-exclusive-interview-with-kayleigh,"
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis sat down for an exclusive interview with Fox News' Kayleigh McEnany in Perry, Florida after serving dinner to linemen who are working on power restoration efforts in communities impacted by Hurricane Idalia. The highlights are below.

Clip 1 Clip 2 Clip 3
On Biden's attempt to politicize Hurricane Idalia:
I studied history, and they act like this is somehow unprecedented. It's not. This area, the Big Bend, got hit by a storm, almost the exact same track in 1896. That at 125 mile per hour winds. So the idea that we've not had powerful storms until recently, that's just not factually true. And so when they that's the first thing they want to say you have to ask why are you trying to politicize the weather.
On Biden's tone-deaf ‘I have no home to go to' comments:
That's odd. I didn't actually hear there hear that he had said that. Look, I was there on the ground as soon as the storm hit. But to be there when they're showing up for the first time seeing their home that had been under six feet of water, some of the homes and like horseshoe beach got washed away. They're now in the water. You know, that hits that hits you in the gut. I mean, it's just a major, major gut punch. And you see that the anguish in people's faces. And you know, they're resilient, and they're tough. But at the same time, when you have something that you built your whole life around, and it's not always their primary residence. Some of these people live interior and then they go out and in some of these, but still either way. It's a major, major gut punch.
On the importance of protecting parental rights:
We want education, not indoctrination, and we want parents to have their rights protected. They ultimately are the ones who have the right to direct the education and upbringing of their kids. And I think parents throughout this country should be able to send their kids to school without having an agenda shoved down their throat. Even ten years ago, nobody would have thought that you would go to a second-grade classroom and teach a second grader that they can change genders. First of all, it's not true. Second of all, it's totally inappropriate. So I think parents rights should apply nationally. How you do that in terms of Congress acting? There are some strings in terms of federal funding that people take. But the bottom line is, for me, I'm going to be on the side of parents. I'm going to be on the side of having curriculum that is rooted in academic achievement, not in somebody's social agenda. And parents have the right to inspect the curriculum.
On the importance of creating a culture of life:
Most of these women do not want to have abortions. But they feel like they have no other options because they get no support. And that's because a lot of these men are nowhere to be found. They should absolutely be providing support. What we've done in Florida is we've recognized that being pro-life means for the whole kit and caboodle. So we've expanded postpartum medical care for poor women to a full year after they have a child. We've also done things to advance options for foster care and adoption because that is something that we want to be able to foster. I think a lot of it comes down to whether women think it's financially feasible to do that. And when they don't get support from the father, then it can be overwhelming. So we in Florida are sympathetic to those women in that situation.

""One of the things that I will do as president is, we are going to bring a reckoning to the CDC, the NIH, the FDA, all these agencies that were responsible for really bad policies.""
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Eric Bolling on Newsmax's The Balance. The highlights are below.

Watch the full interview HERE.
On putting an end to COVID authoritarianism in Florida as Governor:
We have implemented in Florida permanent protections against all those mandates. They can't force you to wear a mask. They can't make your kid wear a mask in school, they can't force you to take these shots. They can't do any of the things that we saw that were offensive, obviously, as governor, you know, I pushed back on all that. But in the future, and what people told me when we enacted those protections is 'Oh, that's not going to happen, those days are over'. But it is happening again. You have a school district in Maryland that just required N-95 masks on schoolchildren, you have Biden wearing masks, he's talking about producing another rushed vaccine that he's going to put money behind, taxpayer money behind. Who knows how they're going to be able to do that. I think they're in court now, they want to be able to reimpose mask mandates on commercial air travel. So they are going to do whatever they can get away with, they are going to use that to their advantage however they can.
On what he would do to stop COVID mandates as President:
One of the things that I will do as president is, we are going to bring a reckoning to the CDC, the NIH, the FDA, all these agencies that were responsible for really bad policies, and lying to the American people about so many different things. Because if you don't have that reckoning, they are going to continue to try to do it again. So we've got to make it clear that what they did was wrong. What they're trying to do now in its infant stages is wrong and we can't let this happen to our country ever again... I think what's happened with agencies like the CDC, they become politicized. They're more interested in enforcing the narrative than in following evidence-based medicine. What you need, you need people like Bhattacharya from Stanford, you need people like Joe Ladapo, our Surgeon General here in Florida, who called this for what it is from day one. Those are the people that were actually following the science. The bureaucrats in the CDC were following the narrative-- And also on the FDA, the FDA is basically a rubber stamp for Big Pharma. How do you justify authorizing an emergency use shot, a COVID shot for six-month-old babies? There was no evidence that it's appropriate to jab a six-month-old baby and they want to do it again and again.
On why he didn't meet with President Biden following Hurricane Idalia:
I was in the communities that were the hardest hit by the storm. And Joe Biden didn't go to those areas, I think correctly, because the whole security apparatus would have shut down the recovery. So I was exactly where I needed to be. We were in Keaton Beach, where the eye of the storm came on shore. And then we were in Horseshoe Beach, which is probably the hardest hit area, you know, they had five, six feet of storm surge, there were people's homes that were washed away entirely. And so you know, that's a really difficult thing to have happen. Fortunately, there were no fatalities, but there was an awful lot of damage. The community was really reeling, everyone was pulling together. But I was exactly where I needed to be to help the people of my state that were the hardest hit. That's not playing politics. That's called being a leader and doing what's right.

Sen Scott: Substance will drive my debate performance. I'll provide the American people with an adult in the room. What we cannot abide by is a food fight where the two biggest winners are Joe Biden's campaign and national media that loves to see Republicans fighting with Republicans. The road to socialism runs right through a divided Republican party. I'll increase my time by allowing the contrast between the candidates on the stage to manifest and then keep talking about why I know America can do for anyone what she's done for me. We have to restore hope, create opportunities, and protect America. That starts with backing the blue and closing our southern border.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley 'Earned Herself a Second Look' After First GOP Debate,2023-09-06T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-earned-herself-second-look-after-first-gop-debate,"
The Messanger by Stephanie Murray
A week before the first GOP debate, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley visited the Iowa State Fair wearing a warning. Her T-shirt said in all capital letters: ""UNDERESTIMATE ME, THAT'LL BE FUN.""
The shirt, which she sells online for $25, underscores Haley's view of the crowded Republican primary. For the first six months of her campaign, Haley has been stuck in the middle of the GOP primary pack. Her support has hovered around 6% in national polls, far behind frontrunner and former President Donald Trump. She's raised less money than Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and got less attention directly after the first presidential primary debate than newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.
But Haley has seen a post-debate boost in her polling, fundraising and event attendance in the weeks since she went on stage in Milwaukee. Her supporters say it's a sign that she's been underestimated all summer.
""A lot of people noticed her,"" said Kim Rice, a co-chair of Haley's New Hampshire campaign and a former state lawmaker. ""As we go further, it's going to be harder for them to ignore her.""
In crucial New Hampshire, Haley is tied for second place with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, according to a new poll published by POLITICO. The NMB Research survey found that Haley and DeSantis each had 10% of support among likely GOP primary voters in the state.
Their support pales in comparison to Trump, who was more than 30 percentage points ahead of each of them in the poll with 47% of support. But a bump to second place is a notable data step up for Haley.
""She really knocked it out of the park at the debate and was able to introduce herself and throw herself into contention,"" said Iowa state Rep. Austin Harris, who was the first lawmaker in the state to endorse her. ""She connected with folks on a big stage and showed that she has what it takes.""
Haley also raised $1 million in the 72 hours after the first Republican debate, according to her campaign, capitalizing in part on her foreign policy face-off with Ramaswamy. The campaign says that she received more online grassroots donations in the 24 hours after the debate than any other single day, saw increased traffic to her campaign website and was the second-most searched candidate on Google.
Haley's share of support may have grown after the debate in Iowa, too, according to a survey published last week by Trump's pollster. Fabrizio, Lee & Associates found that 10% of likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa supported Haley after the debate, while 9% of likely GOP New Hampshire primary voters said the same. DeSantis was only one percentage point ahead of Haley in New Hampshire at 10%, while his lead was wider in Iowa at 18%. (Trump was far ahead in those polls).
""To her credit, she said wait until the debate, that would change things and it did, at least a little, for now. All the buzz from the debate was about Vivek — mixed — and Haley exceeding expectations. Certainly no one's talking about DeSantis and (South Carolina Sen. Tim) Scott based on their debate performance. So she's earned herself a second look,"" said Fergus Cullen, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party.
An earlier pre-debate Iowa poll had shown Haley behind Trump, DeSantis and Scott. The Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll conducted Aug. 13-17 found that she had 6% of support among likely GOP caucus goers in Iowa, tied with former Vice President Mike Pence.
The increased interest in Haley's campaign is coming at the right time, said New Hampshire Republican Bruce Berke, who advised John Kasich in 2016. The Iowa caucuses are only four months away. The New Hampshire primary is expected to happen soon after, although the date isn't scheduled yet.
""It's getting late early,"" Berke said. ""They all need to get themselves defined and get themselves noticed in a positive way to begin to A, break out of the pack, and B, be seen as a reasonable alternative to Trump.""
In the weeks since the debate, Haley has sought to build momentum with a campaign swing through South Carolina, an early primary state where she served as governor, and New Hampshire. Haley also rolled out a list of 10 New Hampshire campaign county chairs on Tuesday morning, one for each of the Granite State's 10 counties.
""As Nikki's message reaches more voters, her toughness and candor is resonating. People like what they're seeing,"" said Haley spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas. ""It's a marathon, not a sprint.""
The pro-Haley super PAC Stand For America is also boosting her with a $13 million ad buy in Iowa and New Hampshire. Her campaign described a pair of China-focused ads using a fire emoji in a press release last month.
Meanwhile, some of Haley's rivals have lost their footing in the primary, Harris noted.
""Ramaswamy was kind of a flash in the pan. I think Tim Scott is kind of fading from the race and DeSantis has stumbled quite a bit. Nikki has found her moment and is seizing on it,"" Harris said.
Haley's debate stage battle with Ramaswamy over foreign policy has continued to escalate after he voiced support for freezing the lines of control to end Russia's war on Ukraine. Immediately after the debate, voter focus groups found that Ramaswamy to be the winner of the night, but Haley's boosters say his lift is temporary.
Ramaswamy's campaign took another swing on Tuesday with a dig about Haley's foreign policy views.
""I don't think we are worried about a woman who enriches herself and her family from her foreign policy. We already have that in the Biden family,"" Ramaswamy spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told The Messenger.
Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was not the only candidate to flex her years of government experience on the stage. Pence slammed Ramaswamy as a ""rookie"" and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie got in on the action, too. Part of Haley's advantage over the others, Berke said, was her delivery.
""She's one of the adults in the room. I think she's respected, I think she has conservative credentials. And I think what's in her favor is that some of the other adults in the room, let's say Mike Pence, she has more pizzazz, more personality,"" Berke said. ""That is going to benefit her here in these remaining dog days of summer and into the gray days of fall.""

Statement by Governor Asa Hutchinson on the Biden Administration's Decision to Block Drilling in Alaska,2023-09-06T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/statement-governor-asa-hutchinson-the-biden-administrations-decision-block-drilling-alaska,"
DES MOINES, Iowa — The Asa for America campaign released the following statement today in regard to the news that President Joe Biden moved to block oil drilling across large sections of Alaska and cancel oil leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. This statement can be attributed to Governor Asa Hutchinson:
""President Biden's misguided decision to ban oil and gas development in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve will have far-reaching negative economic and security implications for America. This decision is wrong. It will only further weaken our nation's energy independence and devastate hundreds of families who will lose jobs due to this short-sighted decision. While I understand the need for conservation and the protection of our nation's breathtaking natural wonders, we need a president who enacts pro-growth policies that balance the needs of our environment, our economy, and our national security."" — Gov. Asa Hutchinson

""We need a reckoning for what they did to this country.""
Tallahassee, FL - Ron DeSantis today joined Dave Rubin on the Rubin Report. The highlights are below.

Watch the full interview HERE.
On the need for COVID accountability:
We need a reckoning for what they did to this country. In Florida, we fought back against it. There were other states like what Kim Reynolds did in Iowa to make sure kids were in school and to push back. But there are parts of this country that were really, really hard because of the Fauci-ism and yet they were wrong about lockdowns. They were wrong about forced masking. They were wrong about school closures. They were wrong about mRNA vaccines, and yet nobody's been held accountable. And it's my view that until there's accountability, they're going to keep trying it again. I mean, the notion that you have a school district in the DC suburbs, I think Montgomery county, imposing masks in 2023 shows that [if] you give these people an inch, they're going to take a mile. So we need that accountability. We're going to bring a reckoning. We're going to turn those agencies inside and out.
On cracking down on COVID authoritarianism:
In Florida, we've enacted permanent protections, so you can't force anybody to wear a mask. You can't force kids to mask in school, you can't close businesses, none of that. We saw that this would be something that would likely happen in the future, and so we put in permanent protections. But that should be the order of the day throughout this country. So accountability for what happened. And just think about it. Not only did you infringe freedom, not only did you lie about things like vaccines, the federal government went an additional $6 trillion in debt over COVID with the with the response, and that's more debt than we racked up in like the first 200 years of this country, and yet people don't want to talk about it.
On why Dr. Fauci should have been fired:
His excuse was, if you fired Fauci, both the democrats and the media would've pitched a fit. Of course it's 100% true, but that's the price of leadership. You gotta stand up and do what's right. Clearly he could've been fired from the White House Task Force. There was no obligation to run him out in press conference after press conference, have him doing media interviews...you know, during the height of the COVID stuff in 2020, Fauci would do local hits in Florida media attacking me for having schools open, so there was no obligation to do that. I think you could have also fired him from the NIH because he had basically committed misconduct with a gain of function. You also had him saying that it was naturally occuring when they knew it was a lab leak. All that stuff has come out now. If it's the right thing to do, you do it. If they sue you, they sue you, but you had the basis to do that and you should have done it. The country would have been better off had he done it.
On putting his money where his mouth is and delivering on American-first policies:
Nobody in the United States in the Republican Party has delivered more on America-first policies and principles than me. If you look at illegal immigration, we've banned sanctuary cities, we've cracked down on human smuggling, we even sent illegal aliens to beautiful Martha's Vineyard. And so we've put our money where our mouth is. You talk about things like China, we've banned the purchase of land by the CCP and its affiliates in our state. We got rid of things like Confucius Institutes, and we cracked down on their influence of universities. You look at what we've done for expanding Second Amendment rights with constitutional carry, look at what we've done to fight against the woke agenda, whether it's fighting Disney involving education, or fighting this ESG movement, which is really bad for our economy, and for American families. The way they're going after domestic energy production, you want to talk about draining the swamp? There's one guy in this entire country that's ever taken action against Soros-backed prosecutors, and that's me.

""This is the best of Ron DeSantis."" ""He gets the job done.""""DeSantis here is at his strongest.""""Governor DeSantis is putting on a masterclass in how to handle and lead through a crisis.""""A no-nonsense approach of helping people in their darkest hours.""
Tallahassee, FL - Wall Street Journal: Hurricane Ron DeSantis
This seems to be Mr. DeSantis in his element, examining the figures, the emergency response plans, the Covid-19 statistics, and then synthesizing it into government policy...
There's a reason that at least some Republican voters have preferred to nominate governors, who have executive experience, over legislators, whose basic job description is to spend three hours orating followed by one minute voting. Using the bully pulpit effectively is important for a President, but so is dragging better policy out of a vast federal bureaucracy that views a Republican in the Oval Office as a temporary hostile occupying power...
His competitors might have a better 15-second retort to the 30-second drive-by at the debate. But could they get the bridge open?

Outnumbered Panel on Fox News
TAMMY BRUCE: It was the right thing to do. It was empathetic. He started immediately on what he could do when it came to funds. And that local leader stepped up. And what I noticed, and this is what I think has to be discussed, is that when she said, there's no politics today, right, there's no parties. That's when you heard more applause. It was a few voices that were drowning out. And then when people were, you know, told to let's back up a little bit, they appreciated that. What's your take?
EMILY CAMPAGNO: Interestingly, both of those examples of leadership sort of represented the level that they represent. So we had the federal level coming in steady and strong like an oak saying, this is the funding that I'm going to give my deepest condolences, my heartbreaks with you. And then the local council woman who says, hold on guys, a bullet knows no party, let's let this Governor speak. Let's let him lead. I really appreciated that level of connection that we saw. And especially when he went on to talk about when he was addressing his constituents about the impending storm and saying, so clearly, so down to earth, you don't need to leave the state, the state, we've got you here, you just need to get to higher ground. And this is what you need. He suspended his campaign to engage and connect with local and state constituents because he at his heart is a servant, because he understands he's a steward of the people. And it's such a stark contrast with so many others, including our current commander in chief who at all times I feel is reading a script or doing what he's told to do. And the actual connection is nonexistent.
GUY BENSON: And, you know, the no comment moment, the lying on the beach, while Americans are suffering, I can understand why people are sort of looking at this split screen between what we're seeing in Florida from the Governor, and what we saw just very recently from the President of the United States. And this is the other thing on a political point. I'm sure that Governor DeSantis and his campaign would love to be on the ground in Iowa right now. Because he's running for president. And he's trailing President Trump by a good margin there. But there's reports on the ground that he's making a comeback, and he's got some momentum. This is the moment where you want to build on that momentum. You want to be on the ground, pressing the flesh, pressing that advantage. But he's back home, because that's the job. He sought that office. He won by 20 points. His responsibility in a moment of crisis - two crises to be there. Even when it's painful.
CHERYL CASONE: I think Ron DeSantis looks very presidential over the weekend, if you will, the opposite of what we saw, in particular, to the response to Maui, and those wildfires. And again, I go back to what the Democrats are doing, they're focusing on one issue and ignoring the reality of what's happening on the ground in Florida, including, by the way, a hurricane that is on the way. Good for Ron DeSantis.
TAMMY BRUCE: And so that's it right this is about it is that it's all of this is wrapped up in national security, personal security, the economy, what individual leadership can do.

David Asman on Fox News
But the fact is, is that you had you had nothing but rhetoric from the President and nothing but action from Governor DeSantis.
Townhall: 'Power Within Six Hours': Cedar Key Sees Florida's Strong Response to Hurricane Idalia
DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis did visit the island on Thursday to survey the damage and talk with locals. They spoke with Laura Duncan, who owns Duncan's on the Gulf. Located right on the water, it was hallowed out and suffered structural damage. Despite the setback, Duncan told DeSantis she would like to rebuild on the same spot.
""It means a lot to us. It gives us a lot of comfort to know that he is part of what's going on and has been always supportive to his people in Florida. God bless him,"" Duncan told Townhall on what DeSantis' visit meant to her, also praising the initial response from FEMA and local authorities...
Lamar Gore, a local contractor, was helping clean out his daughter's art store on 2nd Street. A lifelong resident of the area, Gore was grateful they were without power for only six hours after Hurricane Idalia made landfall.
""All the times that we've had even lesser storms than this. [Hurricane] Hermine wasn't quite as bad as this but...I live in Rosewood, so we were out of power for five days. They had power on the island before we had power there. After the [Idalia's] eye passed us, we had power within six hours. Unheard of,"" Gore said.
DeSantis announced on Thursday the linemen who had been staged ahead of Hurricane Idalia making landfall had restored power to almost half a million homes within 24 hours. Power has been restored to all but four counties: Taylor, Madison, Hamilton, and Lafayette. Most of the Florida National Guard has been demobilized, with their missions being completed. While the acute needs of the hardest hit areas are being met, the residents of the Big Bend region have a long road to make a full recovery.

Spencer Brown on Fox News
Yeah, that's right. And I think you know, no matter who your pick is for 2024, it's hard to deny that Governor DeSantis is putting on a masterclass in how to handle and lead through a crisis and whether that be the preparation that went into this. And even just the response, you know, it's been less than 24 hours since the hurricane made landfall in already 6500 miles where the roads have been cleared. You know, they've restored power to more than a quarter of a million customers. It's clear that as he pointed out on the debate stage, a lot of people might be talking about how they lead, but he's really showing exactly how he leads and so I think that is a benefit to him again, and as Beverly was pointing out, you know, this is kind of the first time in recent memory the airwaves have not been on dominated by what's going on in courts with the former president.

Governor Chris Sununu on NBC Meet the Press
I think the key is you can't make politics out of a disaster like that. **I think Governor DeSantis has actually handled both the previous and current very significant hurricanes very, very well**.
Mark Levin
It's come to the point in Florida with this Governor DeSantis that people expect it to be handled as well as any human being can handle it... And there's a reason for that. **This guy's a can do guy. That's what he is. That's what he does**.

Sean Hannity on Fox News
Florida Governor DeSantis has been hard at work that's what leaders do in times of crisis, they show up they get to work.
Glenn Beck & Stu Burguiere
BECK: By the way, I think the political comment of the week has got to go to Ron DeSantis. Who said if you loot, we shoot. I mean that is - thank you. Yeah, thank you … here in Florida, they might have a gun. Yeah, be careful. You loot we shoot.
BURGUIERE: By the way, you could tell by the fact that there's no coverage of this hurricane and what the response was, it must have gone really well.

Tomi Lauren on Outkick: Tomi Lauren is Fearless
So hurricanes are nothing new to Florida residents. And since Ron DeSantis became Governor true leadership has been a steady constant as well. His ability to plan execute and lead during times of disaster is unmatched. Whether it be a hurricane or COVID tyranny, or just day to day tasks, he shows up, he does the job he makes it about the people and not himself, how refreshing. And as much as the mainstream networks wish they could say otherwise. And as much as they likely hated to feature his leadership this week in the face of Hurricane Idalia. Even they couldn't find a way to make the Governor look bad. He gave them no room to do that not an inch … And that's what leading from the front looks like and in times of crisis whether Trump supporters and leftist want to admit it or not, Ron DeSantis is second to none ... when push comes to shove, he gets the job done. Make America Florida.

James Freeman on Fox News
SANDRA SMITH: … cancel campaign stops suspending his campaign. He shines in these moments.
FREEMAN: He has done well, I think that is the main case he makes to voters that he's done very well in his day job his current job as Governor. We remember roughly a year ago, Hurricane Ian ravaging southwest Florida. I think there were a lot of people in our industry who wanted to report that he botched the response. He didn't and that's part of the reason that he's essentially the main alternative to Donald Trump today.

Piers Morgan on Fox News
You made a great point about DeSantis which is I've been watching him with what's been going on in the last 24 hours: exemplary leadership in a disaster. Very good for him I think in terms of how the American people perceive him as a leader.

Dan Eberhart on Fox Business
What you are seeing in Florida right now Neil is the way Governor DeSantis runs the state and how he suspended his campaign to focus on the hurricane, the aftermath, and making sure people were prepared and the state is helping as many people as possible. The difference in him and former President Trump is the fact that Governor DeSantis is getting stuff done. He runs the state effectively. He's focused on people and their problems. He's not focused on grievance headlines or poking fun at other candidates. He's focused on getting stuff done, and he's focused on what he would like to do for the country, and I think it's a great split screen. Governor DeSantis is getting stuff done, he's focused on solving people's problems, and former President Trump is focused on grievance issues and poking fun at other candidates which isn't helpful especially in Florida where we are dealing with the hurricane aftermath.

Judge Jeanine Pirro on Fox News
It's the opposite of what we saw in Maui... All of this stuff can be handled if we recognize, as Ron DeSantis is recognizing, that you can prepare for it, you can plan ahead, and you can be ahead of the game.

Christian Whiton on Fox Business
If you want someone who is going to be flashy in debates, well, I think he did very well in debates. Polls indicate he gained after that first debate on Fox News, but someone who can actually administer a difficult executive, sprawling executive branch, which has now been demonstrated twice, the hurricane recovery and more significant hurricane last year with Ian. if you contrast it to other candidates, former president Donald Trump and the COVID crisis where we had two-hour press conferences and Anthony Fauci in charge and haphazard response compared to the coherent one, Donald Trump never had control over his own administration. Don't take my word for that. He says it himself. He said he fired a bunch of losers and fired all these people. This hasn't been a problem for Ron DeSantis who can manage his own executive branch. Voters see that and as we're still 400 plus days from the election, still four months from Iowa, plenty of time to make up the gap with Donald Trump and I think after Iowa which I think he'll win, we'll see a race that's very fluid.

Ben Shapiro on DeSantis dealing with crises like Hurricane Idalia
This is the best of Ron DeSantis right, when he's being Governor. This is again why he would make a good president. He's actually good at the actual job. He was asked by a reporter about Donald Trump and the fact that Trump has spent effectively little brain power on the hurricane in Florida. He was tweeting a lot putting a lot of Truth Socials or whatever. DeSantis answers however, he gives the proper answer, which is why are you asking me about this? I'm busy being Governor.

Joe Concha on Fox News
TRACE: Joe, very quickly to you just to kind of finish up what Kevin was saying there. Ron DeSantis off the campaign trail for a while back on hurricane duty for a couple of days, the shooting in Jacksonville. He kind of flourishes in these tough times for Floridians.
CONCHA: We've seen in hurricanes that have hit Florida before, Trace, that he has done an exceptional job in terms of preparing the state and then afterwards after the damage is done repairing the state so DeSantis here is at his strongest, obviously again, this is a Governor who won by nearly 20 points in November, won in blue counties such as Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and even won with Hispanics and suburban women. Ron DeSantis here can really shine without campaigning, but it is like a campaign to show I could run the country like I run my state. Vote for me if you want America to look like Florida.

Brian Kilmeade and Ainsley Earhardt on Fox News
KILMEADE: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just handles his stuff exceedingly well. Yesterday, another example, comes out adlibs knows his stuff by hand. Knows the procedures. Not a lot of wasted words or gratuitous warnings. He's like you don't have to leave the state but you just need to get out of the way. And then you need to come back. You know, you guys know how to handle it. I just thought he talks to you like adults, and Florida is experienced in doing it. But you can only do so much in blocking mother nature.
EARHARDT: And you know, he's exhausted he's been on the campaign trail every single day left the campaign trail to go back home to Florida to deal with the residents there -
KILMEADE: And the shooting.
EARHARDT: - is the pressing issue. Exactly, The shooting in Jacksonville.

Julia Manchester on MSNBC
Yeah, absolutely a task. And I think oftentimes in these moments, Governor DeSantis shows his best side when he's showing his leadership in this, you know, the executive capacity to respond to these crises. And I think it's also interesting because also in these moments, you see him working very well together with the man he's challenging: President Biden. You know, I remember the 2021 building collapse in Surfside Florida, and then hurricane Ian of course, last year, during those two instances, we saw Governor DeSantis and President Biden really come together to put the federal and state governments best foot forward. So you're seeing that I think, again, and it's interesting to see them, you know, very much complementing each other when talking to reporters about the coordination between the federal and state response. But going back to Governor DeSantis, in particular, I mean, you're absolutely right. This is always an opportunity, particularly because he's running for an executive position. And, you know, I guess you could look at it and say, Okay, well, he's off the campaign trail. He's out of these early primary and caucus states like Iowa and New Hampshire, but he like Trump has in many cases is in a way, you know, sucking up the oxygen this week in terms of media attention, getting to be on national news, showing off his executive leadership skills.

Brian Kilmeade on Fox News
Governor leaves the campaign trail, obviously he's Governor and he has to handle the Jacksonville shooting, the horrific racial inspired shooting over in Jacksonville, goes there and then immediately goes and deals with the hurricane. But I also think that's the best way to see if that candidate is the type of person to run the country. How do they act in a crisis with their state.

Katie Pavlich on Fox News
Ron DeSantis prepared the state for if it was going to be really bad and also good preparation makes it so the impact of things isn't as severe. So for example if the power goes out when the Governor has thousands of linemen ready to go to fix those things it makes the consequences and the aftermath much more bearable.

Greta Van Susteren on Newsmax
You know, it's terrible that Florida has so much experience with hurricanes but boy, it sure shows the response and even that we're listening to from the Governor from the people as well as the search and rescue people. It's you know, it's quite amazing how well Florida is responding.

Robert Salvador on Newsmax
ROBERT SALVADOR: And then the last part was we were going to be donating Starlink services for areas that lost internet. As I said, you know, as soon as that hurricane passed, things were back up. So we haven't had to do that yet, because of you know, it's been such a strong response from the state thus far.
ROBERT FINNERTY: Yeah. And it seems like Ron DeSantis, once again, has handled this beautifully. And he's been through several including Hurricane Ian 11 months ago. But talk to us about the area and the storm, you know, went into Georgia, South Carolina, and today it will make its way into the Atlantic Ocean. Talk to us about the area where the storm made landfall not far from Cedar Key, the Big Bend area. I lived in Florida for about five years. And if you live in Florida, you call that old Florida up there hasn't been touched by a Hurricane since record-keeping began at least a century. And a lot of the buildings up there are pre–Hurricane Andrew construction, meaning they are not designed to weather any kind of storm or storm surge. What are you hearing from folks living up in that area?
ROBERT SALVADOR: Sure. You know, I think one of the things that happened was people heeded the warnings this time. You know, if you remember last year, during Hurricane Ian, you know, some of the more unfortunate and tragic things that happened, were in areas where the storm surge came in. And you know, there was loss of life, obviously, loss of property. To your point, you know, up in Cedar Key, I do think there was I believe was a 12 to 15 foot storm surge. So as far as you know, property damage and things like that there is significant damage in Nashville, the state's going to have to help people get back on their feet. But to the last report that I heard, there was no loss of life, which is obviously priority number one. And you know, to what you just said earlier, I think the state and Governor DeSantis really did a great job notifying everyone making sure you know, they were very, very clear saying get out of these places, you can not survive and stay there. And I think, you know, Floridians heeded those warnings. So, people in those direct areas that were hit will definitely have some recovery. You know, the state needs to work with them to get them back on their feet. But I think overall, you know, it's as fortunate of an outcome that we could have hoped for here in Florida, and the recovery is, you know, ongoing and pretty strong the spark.

State Sen. Blaise Ingoglia on Newsmax
First, I really need to thank the leadership of Governor DeSantis. Because he's been out in front on this issue from the very beginning, let everybody know well ahead of time that we were in fear of being struck by this hurricane. But right now the focus is on making sure that we're clearing the low roadways and the infrastructure so emergency vehicles can get in. We're seeing a lot of water damage in the areas that I'm in further north, obviously in Taylor County where it's been hit a lot of wind damage, but right now, the Governor and his teams are making sure that there's power to a lot of these residents. I think we had almost 600,000 homes without power. And I think there's about 200 left, so they're doing a great job, making sure all the linemen were staged in advance and right now we're just in the process of rebuilding the communities which unfortunately we're used to in Florida, but it does help when you have somebody like Ron DeSantis leading the charge.

Brian Kilmeade, Steve Doocy, & Ainsley Earhardt on Fox News
KILMEADE: I love Governor DeSantis' tone through the whole thing just over the last few days, not sensationalistic right to the point, a matter of fact -
EARHARDT: Not dramatic.
DOOCY: He's had a lot of practice.
KILMEADE: Not his hair on fire. And that's the same way he approached the pandemic. Okay, here's the surge. This is where I got to do - this is where the vaccines belong. It's very, very similar style from when we were dealing with him with two years of the pandemic.

Scott Jennings on CNN State of the Union
The only thing that people care about is whether the response is working correctly. And everybody in Florida agrees the response from the federal and the state government is working exactly as it should. Ron DeSantis has a long history of getting these hurricane emergency situations correct. A photo op is not going to change that. Are they doing the job they're supposed to do? Absolutely.

Aishah Hasnie on Fox News
And I think words are very different than actions. Actions speak louder, right, and we are watching what's happening in Florida and how Governor DeSantis is responding. I'm interesting to hear from some political pundits out there on how they make the juxtaposition between how the Governor is responding to this situation, this hurricane, and how the president is.

Piers Morgan on Fox News
What it is, and I was really struck actually by the difference between his response, both in Maui and then again to the hurricane in Florida, and that of Ron DeSantis is running for president because he might end up potentially being in the White House.
On the one hand, you have a guy who's currently got the job, didn't want to comment originally about marriage, I found extraordinary tone deaf, I've no comment to make about one of the worst natural disasters in modern American history. He didn't want to leave his holiday go down there, when of course any normal person, with that scale of disaster, would have gone straight on a plane, just for the optics, never mind anything else. And now, now you want to make it all about himself and this weird fire that went on in his house, we seem to get progressively worse, the only fire known in history that's got steadily worse the year after year after year, since it actually was put out.
By contrast, DeSantis I've been really impressed. I think he's just basically said, forget politics, put all that to one side. He got up at four o'clock in the morning, and he kept pounding that beat. He was on television all day... It's why he's so popular as a Governor, and why he's been so successful. He gets stuff done. And he didn't play politics. He welcomed the President calling him he talked about that. But no way. Did I hear him blame anything. And what's happened down in Florida is really interesting. Three people dead so far, way, way fewer people have died than they were anticipating. Maybe because the preparation that went on by Governor DeSantis and his team was exemplary. And there's a lesson for Joe Biden, stop playing the politics. Do your job.

Manny Diaz on Fox Business Network
We know how important it is not only for the academics, the mental health, and for the parents to be able to do what they need to do. But really all of it speaks to leadership of Governor DeSantis and his staying on course with his philosophy that kids need to be in school in person.

Kat Cammack on Fox News
What we have seen through Governor DeSantis is a no-nonsense approach of helping people in their darkest hours. And that's really what I feel we need someone who is battle tested.

CBS News on the state of Florida's quick response to Hurricane Idalia
The Governor brings up a really good point. Here in Florida, what they do well is respond because they're so used to responding to the storms. So almost immediately in the Perry Florida area where the storm made landfall, we heard that they had crews checking on people first responders into the area. So the response is pretty quick.

Floridian commends the response to Hurricane Idalia on ABC News
Sure. The waters have largely receded, our bridges are passable again. There's a great number of our commercial structures that can maybe not even be rebuilt. I think most of the homes will be able to be rebuilt, but catastrophic is the only way to describe the damage. Governor DeSantis is going to be here today. And so far, the response from federal state and local government has been overwhelming, and I'm hoping with the Governor's visit today, I'm certain he'll do everything he can to get us the rest of the resources we need. But I think our recovery time is going to be measured in months, not weeks.

Mayor Brian J. Aungst Sr. on CBS
Well, the Governor … there was bridges that were closed streets that were closed, underwater on the beach, and he just wanted to know if we needed any immediate help. I said no, but thank you and we will be in touch. So he was checking in just to make sure everything was as good as it could be.

Lieutenant Governor Nunez on Newsmax
The Governor has been working very closely with our federal partners he requested a declaration of emergency which was granted very quickly. The Governor has been in constant communication with all of our partners at the local level. In particular, we know each county is going to have different needs. But we have staged and prepositioned assets all across the state. So like I mentioned, urban search and rescue, we've got lineman, we've got 5,500 National Guardsmen that will that will be helping with the distribution of water supplies, meals, etc. So everything here from Florida is a leader in emergency management and managing hurricanes, no doubt at the national level. So it's a well-oiled machine but we're going to stand by people because we know people are suffering, they're hurting. And as we continue to see the impact of the damage. Governor DeSantis and I will be there every step of the way as they continue to rebuild.

Rep. Jared Moskowitz CNN
The Governor is doing a good job on emergency management. And he has since he came into office, he really understood that emergency management in Florida needed to be the top agency in the country. And in fact, on the very first day that I took over, in 2019, the very first place we went to was Mexico beach. And quite frankly, the government in Florida including the Governor has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into building the greatest Emergency Management Agency of any state in the state of Florida. And they're battle tested, right, they just did in a year ago. And so, you know, the state of Florida is on top of emergency management. We have to be when you have storms like Michael, Ian, and now Idalia all in a four-year period. But look, you know, the state is doing a good job. You know, we've had a couple loss of life, but that's been kept down to a minimum. I think a lot of lessons learned from me and a lot of people listened and heeded those evacuation warnings. But look, we're not out of the woods yet. You know, the immediate response is still ongoing before they eventually transition to recovery.

Bryan Stern, Project Dynamo Founder & CEO on Fox News
I think we saw we saw a lot of damages as many people did, but I really think that this is a testament to Governor DeSantis' leadership, he mobilized a lot of resources he got a lot a lot a lot of things on the street, the electrical guys were out the National Guard was out and people listened to the warnings to evacuate. So I'm not aware of actually have any loss of life with this disaster. You know, if we compare this to Maui, my team and I just got back from Maui where it was so poorly handled from a disaster perspective. Yes, there's damage and pretty rough stuff but better.

Sherrif McNeil on Fox News
Oh, absolutely. Governor DeSantis has stepped up and made sure that this entire state got all the resources they need. And that includes us in Leon County. Have we needed those - the Governor has done a tremendously good job for responding to this hurricane.

Steve Deace
You contrast this now with at this point, just the ruthless efficiency of how he governs in Florida. I don't even know he'll get credit for it anymore. You just take it for granted. It's like Tony Gwynn. Just take for granted Tony Gwynn is going to show up in the ballpark go two for four every day. Just take it for granted. He's going to go two for four every day. He's going to hit 370 every year. And the team may suck around him and may be good around him. You're going to take for granted for 20 years that Tony Gwynn is just going to show up and hit 370 every year. You're just going to take it for granted … give me the guy who hits 40 home runs but he struck out 230 times and hit 220. Yeah, I mean that's the reality of where we are. This was a category four hurricane. Every major airport in Florida in its wake reopened already. By the time we went to bed last night, 400,000 people had had their power restored within 24 hours of a category four storm. And it would only be impressive except they just did this all last year. This happened last year in that state as he was down the stretch to last month of a reelection campaign. Same exact thing. And then we sit here on election night wondering what's going on in Antrim County, Michigan where all these no chain of custody absentee ballots coming from, Florida, the state that made hanging chad a term we all unfortunately learned 20 years ago, at 10:30 he's out there smoking Red Auerbach cigar. Shut it down. We're done. See in the morning. We're all done here.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley to Champion Parents' Rights as She Unveils Education Vision This Week in NH,2023-09-05T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-champion-parents-rights-she-unveils-education,"
New York Post by Ryan King
GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley will champion parents' rights while laying out her education vision this week in New Hampshire with a group against gender-identity changes in classrooms.
Haley, the only Republican woman — and mother — in the 2024 contest, will collaborate with Moms for Liberty for a Wednesday town hall event in Manchester, whose public school system has been engulfed in litigation over allegations it has failed to notify parents about their child's gender changes.
The school system has argued that it has the right to keep that information concealed from parents.
""It is vital for parents to know where all the presidential candidates stand on issues like the weaponization of the federal government against parents and public school overreach at the expense of parental control,"" Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms For Liberty, said in a statement obtained by The Post.
Moms For Liberty, a parental-rights activist group, has drawn fierce flack from the leftover its crusade to combat gender ideology in classrooms and criticism of teachers' unions.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a left-leaning civil-rights organization, designates Moms For Liberty a ""hate group"" for its position on LGBTQ issues and opposition to COVID-19 suppression policies, among other concerns.
""Hey, @SPLCenter, we're proud to stand with @Moms4Liberty,"" Haley wrote on social media last June. ""It's NOT 'extremist' to save women's sports. It's NOT 'extremist' to make sure parents have a say in their children's education. It IS extremist to call a group of patriotic moms a 'hate group.' ""
Haley previously delivered a speech at a summit hosted by Moms For Liberty in Pennsylvania in June.
Other GOP heavyweights such as former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, multimillionaire biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson also attended the Pennsylvania summit.
Haley has long been an advocate of transparency in education.
""There's only one mom running for president, and Nikki will do whatever it takes to fight for our children's future,"" said Ken Farnaso, spokesman for Haley, to The Post.
""That's why she's partnering with Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice in New Hampshire this week to call for putting parents back in charge and making sure teachers educate — not indoctrinate.""
In addition to parental rights concerns, Haley has advocated for more robust measures to boost children's reading abilities as well as more vocational education.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Guest Column: Haley Will Make D.C. Transparent and Accountable,2023-09-04T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-guest-column-haley-will-make-dc-transparent-and-accountable,"
Aiken Standard by S.C. Rep Nathan Ballentine
Nikki Haley Will Make D.C. Transparent and Accountable
Does anyone trust Washington, D.C.? I don't know. And I don't know a South Carolinian who does.
Can you blame us? The nation's capital is a den of self-serving, back-scratching, go-along-to-get-along insider politicians – on both sides of the aisle.
Republicans and Democrats alike spend their days in D.C. doing favors for special interests and throwing taxpayer money to their friends and allies. Look at the billions and counting worth of hidden earmarks they've approved this year.
Ending this abuse of government should be front and center in the 2024 race for the White House.
We need a president who can clean out this den of weasels.
Why not someone who cleaned up South Carolina?
I'm talking, of course, about Nikki Haley. There's no one else in the race who has a better record on bringing transparency, accountability, and honesty to government. At a time when every American is frustrated with D.C., we should all remember what Nikki Haley did here.
Nikki and I entered the South Carolina state legislature at the same time – 2005. As soon as we got there, we were shocked at what we saw. Backroom deals. Influence peddling. You name it. It seemed everyone in the legislature was putting themselves first, even though we were elected to put South Carolina first.
Nikki and I resolved to end this abuse, once and for all. We promised to fight every day for transparency and accountability – even if it meant we didn't make friends in the Statehouse.
Nikki led the charge. The catalyst of her fight was an obvious injustice that no one had ever dared confront. One day, early on, state lawmakers voted themselves a pay raise. But they used a voice vote, so no one would know how their representatives voted.
The dishonesty was obvious. After the vote, every lawmaker could travel back to their district and say, ""I didn't vote myself a pay raise."" But of course, they all did. They lined their pockets with taxpayer dollars. And no one in South Carolina could hold them accountable.
Except Nikki Haley, that is.
Nikki made recording every vote her biggest issue from the very start. She told our colleagues she was going to force them to tell the people how they voted. As she rightly said, it's the most basic measure of transparency there is.
Nikki paid the price for doing the right thing. Republican leadership stripped of her committee assignments. She was iced out by the good ole boys. And when she took to the House floor to give a speech, no one would listen. The message from both sides of the aisle was obvious: Don't you dare try to hold us accountable. Don't you dare try to serve the people.
Nikki let that fuel her fire. She knew her fight was right. So she ran for governor. And of course, she won – both the election and the fight for transparency.
On her first day as Governor, Nikki signed the ""On the Record Voting"" bill into law. And she did it while blasting Pat Benatar's ""Hit me with your Best Shot"" throughout the Statehouse.
I'll never forget standing by her side as she signed that law. It was a great day for South Carolina – one of our best in decades. Because of Nikki Haley, South Carolinians can now search exactly how their representative voted on every bill. That includes pay raises, the state budget, and even committee meetings. Nikki made transparency and integrity the standard in the South Carolina Statehouse.
This fight for transparency created the Nikki Haley we know today. It propelled her from a state legislator, to governor, to US ambassador, and now a presidential candidate.
And make no mistake: When America elects her, she's going to fight like hell to bring transparency and accountability to Washington, D.C. She'll do the same thing in the White House that she did at the Statehouse. She'll fight wasteful spending, pork-barrel projects, and the backroom deals that make D.C. such a cesspool.
You can bet Republicans and Democrats alike will fight her. But you can also bet Nikki will win.
Then South Carolinians – and every American – can start trusting D.C. again.

Haley Campaign Press Release - 'It's Time to Leave': Nikki Haley Knocks Republicans and Democrats After Mitch McConnell Freezes,2023-09-03T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-its-time-leave-nikki-haley-knocks-republicans-and-democrats,"

WASHINGTON – Presidential candidate and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's, R-Ky., health incident, where he froze last week while speaking to reporters, was a symptom of a greater ""congressional problem.""
The 81-year-old Kentucky Republican's latest episode raised questions once again on whether some older lawmakers are facing health problems that could make serving Americans difficult. Haley, in an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" pointed to 90-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein's, D-Calif., health problems as well, calling for ""a younger generation"" in Congress.
""At what point do they get it's time to leave?"" Haley said. ""They need to let a younger generation take over. We want to go and start working for our kids to make sure we have a strong national security, to make sure we have a stronger economic policy, to make sure that America is safe.""
""And we can't do that if these individuals refuse to give up power,"" Haley continued. ""This is not just a Republican or Democrat problem. This is a congressional problem. And they've got to know when to leave it. It's time to pass this down to a new generation of conservative leaders that want to take our country to a better place.""
Haley reiterated her support for term limits in Congress and mental competency tests for ""the entire Congress.""
""Tell us where you were born, name four words that start with the same letter. How many grandchildren do you have? These are basic questions that anyone should be able to answer,"" Haley said.
During a news conference earlier this year at the U.S. Capitol, McConnell abruptly stopped speaking and stood silently for roughly 28 seconds. He was then escorted away from a lectern by his Republican colleagues.
The Senate minority leader will be consulting a physician prior to his next event, a McConnell aide, who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly, told USA TODAY. McConnell was hospitalized in March for a fractured rib and concussion he suffered from a fall at a hotel in Washington.
Feinstein and McConnell have drawn similar criticism. The California lawmaker has suffered awkward moments on Capitol Hill since she returned to Washington, D.C. in May after a nearly three-month absence. Feinstein was hospitalized with shingles in March. She also suffered from encephalitis, or brain inflammation, as well as Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley's Campaign Launches Effort to Capture Youth Vote Across 45 States,2023-09-02T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haleys-campaign-launches-effort-capture-youth-vote,"
Fox News by Adam Sabes
Nikki Haley's presidential campaign is launching a 45-state effort to capture the youth vote. Haley's campaign told Fox News Digital it's launching Young Americans for Nikki and Students for Haley with registered members across 45 states. The campaign says it has launched Students for Haley campus chapters at 25 U.S. colleges.
Mason Foley, executive chair of Young Americans for Nikki, told Fox News Digital young Americans are looking for a strong leader and thinks Haley is the candidate for the job.
""With committed supporters in 45 states, it is clear that young Americans across the nation are hungry for a principled and unifying leader that will take our nation into the next generation. Nikki Haley is no stranger to fighting the tough battles, speaking the hard truths and defying the odds,"" Foley said.
""After last week's debate, it's obvious that Nikki Haley is Joe Biden's biggest threat. We can't wait to spread her message to voters across America, starting with our alma mater, Clemson University.""
The announcement comes after the Haley campaign hauled in $1 million in donations following the first GOP presidential nomination debate.
""I think in the first 72 hours we raised a million dollars. We've had thousands of people volunteer. We've had a lot of people join the campaign. The phones are still ringing,"" Haley said in an interview with Fox News Digital Monday.
During the debate, Haley heavily criticized Vivek Ramaswamy on foreign policy issues ""Under your watch, you will make America less safe. You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows. It shows,"" Haley told Ramaswamy.
Speaking on Israel, Ramaswamy pushed back, saying America's relationship with the country ""will never be stronger than by the end of my first term.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Hauls $1 Million in 72 Hours After the First GOP Presidential Primary Debate,2023-09-01T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-hauls-1-million-72-hours-after-the-first-gop,"
Fox News by Paul Steinhauser
Former ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley says her Republican White House campaign has had a ""fantastic response"" since last Wednesday's first GOP presidential nomination debate.
""I think in the first 72 hours we raised a million dollars. We've had thousands of people volunteer. We've had a lot of people join the campaign. The phones are still ringing,"" Haley said on Monday in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.
Haley spoke minutes before holding her first event since last week's debate: a jam-packed town hall in Indian Lake, South Carolina. Haley's campaign said that roughly 1,000 people filled the auditorium, balcony and overflow rooms at a community event space in this northern South Carolina town along the border with North Carolina.
Pointing to the support, Haley said, ""We're grateful. We're absolutely grateful. But it only keeps us more motivated because we have a country to save.""
Haley, the only woman among the major candidates running for the Republican nomination, was the first contender on the stage at last week's Fox News-hosted debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to come out swinging, targeting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and former Vice President Mike Pence early in the debate for supporting legislation that raised the national debt.
And Haley, who served as former President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, was the first to target Trump over his perceived electability liability, arguing the former president was the ""most disliked"" politician in the country.
She also heavily criticized another rival, multimillionaire biotech entrepreneur and first-time candidate Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy. She repeated those comments at Wednesday's town hall, charging Ramaswamy's proposals were ""completely naive""
Asked about the first showdown, Haley said in her interview, ""You never know what you're going to get when you get on a debate stage. You never know what questions you're going to be asked. You don't know who's going to attack or not attack. You don't know. So it's all instinct and gut. And it's about communicating as much as you can, and that's what we tried to do.""
""I think we only had eight and a half minutes in two hours. I would have loved to say more, but you take the most of the time that you're given to really get the substance, solutions and policy out there, and that's what I tried to do,"" she emphasized.
Haley appeared to enjoy a small bounce in some of the initial public opinion surveys conducted following the debate, but she remains in the single digits, and along with the rest of the large field of contenders remains far behind Trump, who remains the commanding front-runner for the nomination.
But Katon Dawson, a former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party and Haley campaign adviser and surrogate, told Fox News that ""what the Fox debate did for us as a campaign was made it all real and start coming together, and I think they [voters] understand the fact that Nikki's different. … You saw that difference on the debate.""
Dawson emphasized that the first debate ""put gasoline on the fire, and now we've got to continue to keep working.""
Palmetto State based Republican consultant Dave Wilson told Fox News that ""I think everybody in South Carolina who knows Nikki Haley saw the Nikki Haley that they know.""
""The question is one of whether or not the nation has seen a Nikki Haley that they think that they can get behind,"" Wilson, who's neutral in the 2024 GOP presidential nomination race, emphasized.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott's Day in South Carolina!,2023-09-01T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scotts-day-south-carolina,"
Hey, this is Phillip, Tim Scott's South Carolina State Director.
Tim Scott was back in his home state of South Carolina for a jam-packed day meeting with over 3,200 conservative supporters and sharing his plan to empower parents in America.
He drew in MASSIVE CROWDS across the state, from Charleston to Lexington to Greenville! He finished his day in Anderson for Jeff Duncan's 12th Annual Faith and Freedom BBQ.
At every event, it was clear: Americans are sick and tired of watching nasty political fights. They're looking for a leader focused on fixing the issues that affect them daily rather than someone more interested in having a food fight with their opponents.
Tim Scott is THAT guy. Check out what The Post and Courier said about him:
""But what if Scott is onto something here? A lot of folks are sick of the nastiness in politics — and in the world — today. If that sentiment catches on, by this time next year, Scott could be sitting pretty.""
His politeness is surprising to many and not something we're accustomed to anymore, but we need less political performances and more action. More than that, we need a leader who will revive personal responsibility and pride in ourselves.
Tim learned that from his mother, and it's something that strikes a chord with Americans everywhere.
""Scott is leaning heavily into his inspirational, up-from-poverty biography, as he should. And when he brought out his mom — ""My mother taught me if you're able-bodied, then you work. You take out a loan, you repay it. You commit a violent crime, you go to jail …"" — she got a standing ovation.""
You can feel the momentum growing for Tim Scott, but don't just take my word for it…take a look

WACH Fox 57: ""South Carolina's own Tim Scott making his pitch to voters saying he wants to give power back to the people, more specifically, parents.""
""Tim Scott's a man of strength, and his strength doesn't come from having a loud mouth. It comes from his integrity and his character in ways demonstrated already that he can do in office"" said one Lexington voter.
WCIV: ""Senator Scott took every opportunity he could to stop, meet, and speak with almost everyone he encountered when he entered the room... taking in the 'family culture' that was very much on display.""
The Lexington Chronicle: ""Compared to other town halls that Republican candidates have hosted in the county, Scott's took on more of a family feel.""
Fox Carolina: ""Senator Scott talked about the importance of education, not just in South Carolina, but across the entire country.""
It was a wildly successful day in the Palmetto State, and we can't wait to do it again soon! Until then, keep up with Tim Scott's campaign by following his South Carolina for Tim Scott page on Facebook!
Until next time,

"Haley Campaign Press Release - A Vote for Biden is a Vote for President Kamala Harris. Nikki Haley is Right, America",2023-09-01T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-vote-for-biden-vote-for-president-kamala-harris-nikki-haley,"
Fox News by Liz Peek
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley warns, ""A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris,"" suggesting that re-electing the aged and addled president would almost certainly vault the vice president into the Oval Office within the next four years.
The alarm from the GOP candidate is resonating; just about nobody wants Harris to be our next commander in chief. As Haley says, the very thought should ""send a chill up every American's spine.""
Biden's campaign is taking heed, prompting the White House to roll out yet another effort to reboot Harris' ""image"" — by some counts the third such initiative in the past two years.
Vice President Harris, for the Biden White House, is both a blessing and a curse. Without Harris in the wings, the president would have faced even louder encouragement to step aside, inspired by his dismal approval ratings, alleged corruption and declining acuity. Some 44% of Democrats do not want Biden to run again, according to a recent Monmouth University poll. But Democrats are wary; if Biden steps out of the race, Harris, who has even worse favorability than the president, steps in. In that same poll, only 13% of her party wishes her to be the candidate.
On the other hand, if more GOP contenders begin to echo Haley, Americans might think twice about voting for doddering Joe.
The White House needs to pump up Kamala Harris… fast. It's not as though they haven't tried. Earlier in the administration, they even started calling the second gentleman Douglas instead of Doug, to make him appear a more serious and appropriate spouse for a woman best known for breaking into hysterical laughter at the oddest moments. True story.
Mostly, the makeovers have teetered on assigning Harris to new roles, hoping she might finally get traction. On her initial briefs — acting as U.S. border czar and the point person on overhauling voting rights — she fell flat. Her response to being asked if she would visit the border early on was to break into giggles, a telling moment that, given the gravity of the border crisis, should disqualify Harris from higher office.
Naturally, any redo starts with the help of the liberal media. Predictably, here comes a slew of puffy articles about the vice president. Politico recently ran this intriguing headline: ""Why Kamala Harris is a Better VP than You Think.""
It is worth a read. Houdini's famous contortions pale next to author Julia Azari's attempts to explain Harris' face plant in office. In desperation, the political science professor points out that one possible VP role is to speak up for underrepresented groups, but then has to acknowledge that even Black people don't much like Harris.
Azari dismisses criticisms of Harris' infamous ""word salads"" (because, you know, George W. Bush also spoke poorly) and her inability to retain staff (women of color have it tougher) but fails to make the case that Harris is a success. In desperation, she closes with, ""In the final analysis, her political difficulties, and their causes, are nebulous and hard to pin down. Kind of like the vice presidency itself.""
The New York Times chimes in, writing recently, ""Kamala Harris Takes on a Forceful New Role in the 2024 Campaign."" The reporter begins: ""The vice president is trying to reclaim the momentum that propelled her to Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s side as a candidate and into the White House in 2020.""
What is he talking about? Harris flopped as a presidential hopeful early in the 2020 election cycle; a few months before she dropped out, a Quinnipiac poll showed her winning the votes of only 7% of Democrats and only 1% of the Black vote. Her career was hanging by threads when Biden narrowed his VP choices by promising to tap a woman of color. The list of possible recruits was short; only Harris had any national name recognition.
In a November 2019 piece about the implosion of Harris' run, the Times reported that Harris ""proved to be an uneven campaigner who changes her message and tactics to little effect and has a staff torn into factions."" Also: ""there is only one candidate who rocketed to the top tier and then plummeted in early state polls to the low single digits: Ms. Harris.""
Now the Times is extolling her expanding presence on the campaign trail, lauding her attacks on GOP hopeful Ron DeSantis and confronting ""rising extremism in the Republican Party…"" In particular, Harris slammed the Florida governor's African American history curriculum, which she claims (along with other civil rights activists) portrays slavery as in some instances beneficial. As William Allen, one of several Black authors of the disputed material, has argued, the reference is historically accurate and is one line in 216 pages.
In other words, Harris is, characteristically, spewing dishonest talking points instead of engaging in thoughtful or serious debate.
What the Times fails to mention is that Harris is more visible on the campaign trail mainly because she's filling a void. Biden has done little campaigning, for good reason. Almost any time he steps to a microphone, his aides steel themselves for the inevitable goof — not knowing where he is, getting facts and dates wrong, or wandering lost from the podium. These are not Republican talking points; these are signs that Biden should not run again.
Harris is not a failed VP because the tasks are too tough or because she hasn't been allowed a long leash — excuses the liberal press toss out to explain her abysmal ratings. She has failed because she is not a serious person and did not deserve such an important role.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Support for Haley on the Rise in SC Following Strong Showing in First Republican Debate,2023-08-29T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-support-for-haley-the-rise-sc-following-strong-showing-first,"
The State by Javon L. Harris
South Carolina's Nikki Haley racked up support for her 2024 presidential bid as she rode the high of her first presidential primary debate performance before a large crowd in her home state.
Following an uptick in her campaign after her widely lauded debate performance last Wednesday, Haley attracted more than a thousand potential voters during a town hall at the CrossRidge Center in Indian Land on Monday. In the largest crowd the venue has seen, the former S.C. governor touted her record on immigration and national security while gliding on the tenacity some voters say has landed them firmly her corner.
""I've been on the fence about Nikki for a long time, but the debate the other night brought me over to her side,"" said Jude Sowell, 68, an Independent who traveled from Charlotte for the event. ""She showed some real backbone, and that's something I had not seen from her in the last couple of years, but I thought she really had the best performance among any of those guys.""
Haley, who went into the first Republican primary debate polling in the single digits nationally, came out taking shots at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina U.S. Sen. Tim Scott — and at frontrunner Donald Trump himself.
Her presidential campaign says it received more online donations in the first 24 hours after the debate than in any other single day of her campaign, which kicked off in February. And traffic to the campaign website increased tenfold, as viewership on the campaign's YouTube and other social media surged.
""Did any of you happen to watch the debate?"" Haley asked the Indian Land crowd. ""Bless his heart,"" Haley said, referring to Vivek Ramaswamy, who, during last Wednesday's debate, said he's opposed to continuing to fund the war in Ukraine. ""If you say something that's totally off the wall, I'm going to call you on it every single time.""
It was that sort of grit that wooed a throng of Haley supporters Monday.
""I want her to just have an opportunity to tell others about her no nonsense approach to government and to the country,"" said Diane Crawford, 68, of Rock Hill. ""I feel very confident that I would sleep well at night knowing she was in the White House.""
A Washington Post poll after the debate found 29% of debate watchers believe DeSantis performed the best; 26% said Ramaswamy performed the best; and 15% said Haley.
Haley also saw the percentage of people who would consider voting for her increase to 46% after the debate, up from 29% pre-debate, the greatest improvement out of anyone in the field, according to the Washington Post poll.
Haley's foreign policy experience — especially in relation to China — as former ambassador to the United Nations has lured a number of conservative voters, who not only say they fear for the country's national security, but also for the increasing divisiveness spreading throughout the Republican party and the nation.
""Her experience with foreign affairs, dealing with a lot of different views, gives her some expertise in swaying Congress and unifying the Republican Party,"" said Fred Davidson, 68. ""But it'll also help with the issues we're facing with China and Russia.""
As South Carolina remains one of only two states without a hate crimes law, Haley told supporters that there's no place for hate in America, citing a racially-motivated shooting that occurred in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend. She did not, however, signal whether a hate crimes law was due in the Palmetto State.
""All of this division and hate has got to stop,"" Haley said. ""But don't fall into the narrative that this is a racist country.""
While on Monday Haley belabored what she considers to be the ills of America, including soaring inflation and a lack of boarder security, she told supporters that ""the time for whining is over.""
""Now we get to work,"" she said, showcasing her plan to alleviate the plagues she claims President Joe Biden has caused toward crime, the economy and foreign policy.
""We can do this,"" Haley said. ""But it's going to take a lot of courage.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - FLOWERS: When Nikki Haley Roared,2023-08-29T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-flowers-when-nikki-haley-roared,"
NH Journal by Christine Flowers
I'm not the kind of person that cottons to the idea of ""girl power."" I am woman, you will not hear me roar. I will not be seeing the Barbie movie. I do not believe all women. MeToo is not only a lie; it's bad grammar. And the worst ""F"" word for me is Feminist.
Just to get that out of the way.
But every now and then, I do look at myself in the mirror and appreciate the fact that I have two X chromosomes instead of that pesky ""Y.""
Debate night was one of those times.
I had just come from a fantastic dinner with four women I'd gone to school with at Merion Mercy Academy in the last century. (Literally, it was the last century, although they looked fabulous.) We'd reminisced about old friends, and older nuns, and the wine and affection flowed freely. It occurred to me that having gone to a girls' Catholic school was one of the best things that ever happened to me.
And then I went home and turned on the TV so I could watch the gladiatorial debates between all of the GOP candidates not named Donald Trump. I say ""gladiatorial"" with tongue in cheek because I wasn't expecting fireworks from a panel that included Asa Hutchinson, Mike Pence, the guy from North Dakota, and Tim Scott, all very nice and accomplished men who don't scream. I was expecting Chris Christie to do his ""I'm The CNN Avenger Come To Take Out Trump"" schtick, and I also thought that Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis would get into it a bit (which didn't happen.)
What I wasn't expecting was to be wowed by the woman who did, in fact, do Helen Reddy justice and roared.
Former South Carolina governor and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley was loud, proud, and quite brilliant when it came to putting her male opponents in their places regarding foreign affairs. And that makes sense, given her pedigree and her experience screaming at tyrants from across the table at the UN. None of the other candidates had a chance, at least concerning international relations.
I know that a lot of people hold a lot of different opinions on our relationship with Russia and the war in Ukraine. I am personally in the anti-Putin-Russia dictator who invaded another country camp, and I am not opposed to additional aid to a Western ally.
But even if I was, I could have taken a step back and simply admired the forthright courage of a woman who didn't mince words about a man who very likely, earlier that day, had orchestrated the murder of another of his opponents, Wagner CEO Yevgeny Preghozin. Haley actually referenced that when it seemed that the boys weren't in the mood to speak truths to power. That alone made me feel proud to have angry ovaries.
The GOP has always been the party of international strength, of standing up to tyrants, of ripping a giant hole in the Iron Curtain. Reagan didn't do it by himself, and he stood on the shoulders of other conservative giants who believed that you deal with despots from a position of strength, not conciliatory gestures. Haley reminded me of them and the tradition of politicians, often derisively called ""neo-con."" And while I do not believe we should be going around the world as Human Rights Policeman without any assistance from our allies, I am also convinced that ridiculing the efforts to end the war in Ukraine is not in any way, shape, or form conservative.
That sets me apart from many in my tribe, and I don't actually care. Neither does Haley. She showed that Wednesday night with aplomb and eloquence.
I don't know if Nikki will make it to the finish line. It's too far away to make any predictions, and the Trump card, so to speak, has not played out. But I can tell you that watching her on stage was a revelation, and it made me, for a brief moment, want to dig out my old Ambassador Barbie (yes, there was one) and hug her.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: First Lady Casey DeSantis Delivers Remarks at the 12th Annual Faith & Freedom BBQ Hosted By Rep. Jeff Duncan,2023-08-29T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-first-lady-casey-desantis-delivers-remarks-the-12th,"
Anderson, SC - First Lady Casey DeSantis yesterday delivered remarks at the 12th Annual Faith & Freedom BBQ hosted by Representative Jeff Duncan. The First Lady attended the event in place of Governor DeSantis as he stayed in Florida to prepare for Hurricane Idalia. The highlights are below.

Watch her full remarks HERE.
On why America needs a restoration of family values:
As a mom of a six, five and three year old, I want a president of the United States who prioritizes education over indoctrination. We need a president who defends the rights of parents and protects the innocence of our children, and someone who rejects critical race theory, DEI, gender ideology for kindergarteners and pornographic books in schools. So how about electing a president of the United States who has children, who come home to the White House with homework instead of cocaine? How about that? So we need a restoration of sanity in our country, a restoration of family values, and the fundamental truths that make America great.
On why Ron DeSantis is the man for the job:
When the world went mad, Florida stood as a bastion of freedom. Ron said, 'Not on my watch'. He held the line in defense of people's rights, liberties, livelihoods and happiness. He fought and he did keep the state of Florida free. And listen, he took the hits. I mean, he would roll out of bed in the morning and the media, the left and even Republicans would be going after him. I would joke and say the guy could say he could walk on water, but the media would come out and say that he couldn't swim, it was like no matter what he was always getting hit. And I remember him saying that, if it means that I lose my job so the people of Florida can keep their job, so be it. That is what a leader has to do to put the interests and the well being of the people ahead of themselves. And that's the kind of leader that, you're gonna get as President of the United States.
On ending the weaponization of the federal government:
We need a president of the United States who fires the director of the FBI on day one. How about we elect a president of the United States who hires a new attorney general and who doesn't have the FBI going after moms who go to school board meetings for the innocent children? How about that? How about we have a president who relocates parts of the DOJ to places like Arkansas, get them out of Washington, DC, Washington DC is 99.99% Uber liberal, we've got to get the swamp out of Washington. And speaking of DC, how about we elect a president who will use the power of the presidency to reduce the federal bureaucracy by 50%.
On Florida's record of accomplishments:
As a result of strong leadership in Florida right now, Florida is ranked number one for the economy in the nation, number one in K through 12 education, number one in higher education. The state has a 50-year crime low. And we have the largest net in migration of any state in the nation because people are voting with their feet.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Ron DeSantis Over Halfway on Iowa 99-County Tour,2023-08-29T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-ron-desantis-over-halfway-iowa-99-county-tour,"
Following a three-day,15-county swing, DeSantis has visited 53 counties on the ""Full Grassley""
Right after his win on the debate stage in Milwaukee, Ron DeSantis went back to Iowa to continue on his quest to visit all 99 counties - the ‘Full Grassley.' DeSantis visited 15 counties in just three days as a special guest on Never Back Down's bus tour, taking his total counties visited up to 53. The swing came as 26 local officials, longtime activists, farmers, sheriffs, and veterans from 19 counties across Iowa endorsed DeSantis.
DeSantis started his Iowa swing with a trip on Thursday to the Field of Dreams baseball field in Dyersville, with the whole family in tow. He played ball with the kids and met local supporters and baseball fans. See more photos in the Des Moines Register.

On Friday morning, DeSantis and his family began their bus tour with Never Back Down, starting off the day with a meet and greet in Lyon County. DeSantis is the first 2024 presidential candidate to visit Lyon. He was introduced by Dr. Cody Hoefert, former co-chair of the Iowa GOP, who was one of the 26 endorsements that DeSantis gained post-debate.
""I talk to Iowans every day in my chiropractic practice, and they all tell me the same thing. They want leadership. They don't want showmanship,"" Hoefert said. ""They want someone who says what they're going to do and deliver upon it. They want someone who cares more about everyday Iowans than they care about themselves.""
After the meet and greet, DeSantis made a series of retail stops: Grace Boutique in Osceola County, Valero Renewable Fuels in O'Brien County, Northwest Iowa Small Business Development Center in Clay County, a Dairy Queen in Palo Alto county, and J&J AG Solutions in Emet County.

DeSantis ended Friday at a meet and greet event with Iowa House Speaker Pro Tempore John Wills in Dickinson County. Representative Wills said, ""It was great to be with Governor DeSantis yesterday on his tour of Iowa. He visited seven counties yesterday. The end visit was in Dickinson County, where DeSantis drew a standing-room-only crowd.""

On Saturday, DeSantis drew a packed house of Iowan veterans at a meet-and-greet at the Algona VFW in Kossuth County with Iowa State Representative Henry Stone.

Then, he met with local faith leaders in Humboldt County after visiting St. Olaf Lutheran Church, where Pastor Joyce Schmidt prayed over the DeSantis family.

Afterwards, DeSantis made a stop at Clarion Meat Locker in Wright County.

He hit county #50 at a Pizza Ranch in Hancock County.

Then, he visited Family Alliance for Veterans in Winnebago County and the Manly Terminal in Worth County. DeSantis ended the whirlwind trip with a meet and greet event in Cerro Gordo County with Iowa Senator Waylon Brown.

Tim ScottNew York PostAugust 28, 2023
When Martin Luther King, Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial 60 years ago Monday, facing the building where I currently serve, he described his hope that his nation would continue its promise toward becoming a more perfect union.
America is achieving King's dream — despite the claims of the radical left.
Our progress is palpable, even if it conflicts with some people's politically motivated narratives.
When King delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech in 1963, America faced a dark moment of hatred and division in our history.
The fight for equality was being met with violent opposition.
That same year, in my home state of South Carolina, college students protested the integration of our universities on the steps of the state capitol.
Instead of resigning himself to the idea we were hopeless, he had hope that America would meet the challenge.
King believed then what some doubt now — that if you have faith in God, faith in each other and faith in our nation's future, all things are possible.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Rolls Out Empower Parents Plan,2023-08-28T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-rolls-out-empower-parents-plan,"
Tim will travel across South Carolina today to unveil the plan before heading to Iowa on Wednesday and Thursday. 
CHARLESTON, SC -  Today, Tim Scott rolled out his plan to empower parents. The plan outlines key policy points to defend America's children, empower parents, and protect kids online.
Tim is in his home state of South Carolina today meeting with parents, homeschool advocates, and voters. He will host events across South Carolina in Charleston, Lexington, Greenville, and end his evening speaking at Jeff Duncan's Annual BBQ. Later in the week, Tim will continue to share his Empower Parents Plan in Iowa where he will host multiple events across the Hawkeye State on Wednesday and Thursday.
""Teachers' unions, Big Tech, and Joe Biden are on a mission to make parents less important,"" said Tim Scott. ""I have a bold agenda to support and empower parents — from the classroom to the locker room to the smartphone. We must empower parents and give them a choice, so that every child has a chance.""
Tim Scott's Plan To Empower Parents: 
Family First Culture: Defend Our Children

Restore American childhood and let girls and boys be girls and boys, not guinea pigs.
Save Title IX and women's sports — if God made you a man, you play sports against other men.
Stand with crisis pregnancy centers and stop the DOJ from turning a blind eye to far-left threats and vandalism.

Education: Empowered Parents

Defend every parent's right to know what their child is hearing and reading in school.
Empower every family the right to opt out of propaganda that attacks their values and religious liberty.
Break the back of the teachers' unions and enact nationwide school choice.
Create choice in education, so parents can decide whether it's public school, private school, charter school, STEM school, or homeschool that is best for their child.
End the attacks on excellence by rejecting the false notions of ""equity"" and the Left's attacks on honors classes.
Replace indoctrination with education. ABC, not C.R.T.

Stop Big Tech: Protect Children Online

Stop Big Tech from stealing kids' attention spans, China from stealing their privacy, and predators from stealing their future.
Require country-of-origin labeling on every app, so parents are fully informed.
Make Big Tech do more to keep kids safe online.

Charleston, S.C. - Tonight, Tim Scott joined Sunday Night in America with Trey Gowdy on Fox News to discuss his debate performance and the importance of standing up for life.

WATCH HERE
Tim Scott: The loudest voices in the debate were the quietest voices on the issue of life. Protecting life on the federal level with a 15-week limit is in America's best interest, and it reflects our Declaration of Independence that says our Creator gave us inalienable rights, including the right to life. So if we are going to allow California, New York, and Illinois to have abortion on demand up until the day of birth, shout it from the mountaintops about issues that do not matter, and then being quiet like a church mouse on the debate stage on the issues that are relevant to our primary voters, and frankly to a party based on freedom to deny that freedom and not stand for life, as three of the candidates did on the debate stage. That's a shame, and shouting and screaming about nothing, and then being quiet about something, does not reflect the kind of leadership that will get the job done.

CHARLESTON, SC - Tim Scott launched new ads today ahead of his post-debate early state swing to New Hampshire, Iowa, and his home state of South Carolina. The ads highlight the consequences of Biden's policies on everyday Americans as Tim shares his message to renew American strength.

TRAGIC TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: I'm at our southern border to send a message to the radical Left.
Biden's liberal policies aren't compassionate. They're tragic.
Teenagers overdosing on fentanyl. Young women being sold by human traffickers. Violent crime on the rise.
As Commander in Chief, I will eliminate Biden's 87,000 IRS agents and use that money to finish the wall and double the border patrol.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because we must secure this border now.

WATCH: Lead The Charge
LEAD THE CHARGE TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: Joe Biden is out of step and out of ideas.
He has law enforcement retreating from our border and our neighborhood streets.
And America retreating from our deepest held values.
I'll be the President who ends the Biden retreat and leads the charge for American strength.
I'll build the wall, fund our police, and defend our God-given freedoms.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because I have faith in America and our president should too.

Hutchinson Campaign Press Release - ICYMI and WTAS About Governor Hutchinson's Debate Performance,2023-08-25T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/hutchinson-campaign-press-release-icymi-and-wtas-about-governor-hutchinsons-debate,"
See what others are saying about Governor Hutchinson's debate performance
BENTONVILLE, Ark. — Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican presidential candidate, demonstrated steadfast, consistent leadership on the debate stage in Milwaukee this past Wednesday evening. Finding himself on a stage amid an out-of-control and, at times, unintelligible scrum, Governor Asa Hutchinson stood apart through his demeanor, preparation, adherence to standards and experience that showed the American people he was ready to serve as commander-in-chief. Governor Hutchinson wasted no time in demonstrating leadership during Wednesday night's debate. After recent comments regarding Israel by another candidate in the race, Governor Hutchinson believed it to be vitally important to signal to Israel, the Jewish people, and the rest of the world that, in a Hutchinson administration, the United States of America would remain Israel's longest and most loyal ally. Additionally, Governor Hutchinson differentiated himself from the rest of the field by being the only one to acknowledge the dangers of climate change, indicate that he would not support Donald Trump if he was convicted of serious felonies, and highlight a record of conservative accomplishments demonstrating his ability to produce results for the American people.
Here are what others had to say about Governor Hutchinson's debate performance on Wednesday night:
""Hutchinson barely met the criteria to make the stage in Milwaukee — but once there, he used the evening to establish himself as a figure one could actually imagine as president of the United States. Mature, measured, and thoughtful, Hutchinson highlighted an Arkansas record that should appeal to results-oriented conservatives. He spoke positively and optimistically about bringing out the best in the country...Hutchinson was, in short, who most fit with the mold of a modern Ronald Reagan."" —Scot Lehigh, The Boston Globe
""My God. He is going to run as Asa Hutchinson. Asa Hutchinson took the stage Wednesday night at the Fox News debate and showed the nation who he is: the adult in the room...Asa Hutchinson answered the questions put to him, showed off his extensive resume, and gave people an eight-year history lesson of Arkansas during his administration. He might have said, 'Now wait a minute,' when one of the other candidates said all of the others on stage were bought and paid for, but he didn't exactly jump out of his shoes. Asa Hutchinson doesn't jump out of his shoes. Now we wait to see if that kind of adulting will do the trick...if folks want Mike Pence's resume, Ron DeSantis' administrative record, Chris Christie's move-on crusade, and Nikki Haley's (mostly) soothing demeanor, Asa Hutchinson would be the man. He's not going to insult anybody, change his principles to meet the moment, or develop another personality on the fly."" — The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Editorial Board
""Even though he didn't get much air time at the Republican presidential debate Wednesday, he accomplished what he needed to do: He made it to the stage, and he differentiated himself from other candidates...Hutchinson distinguished himself in two ways. His big moment came when the Fox News moderators asked who would still support former President Trump, who was not at the debate, if he were convicted in court. Debate participants were required to sign a pledge that they will support the nominee whoever that is. Trump did not sign it...When the candidates had to make a spur-of-the-moment decision, Hutchinson was the one who stood the strongest on his convictions. Maybe some of the party's anti-Trump activists and donors took note. The other way Hutchinson distinguished himself was by not getting involved in a lot of the squabbling back and forth among the other candidates. It meant he didn't get as much air time, but it reinforced his selling point as the drama-free adult in the room."" — Steve Brawner, Independent Arkansas
""Governor Hutchinson cut through with competence and clarity at the debate. He isn't looking over his shoulder, he isn't following the pack—he's a leader, and he knows why he's in this race. It is critical that Republican voters hear his message—and he has the conservative record and experience to actually put runs on the board if he wins."" — Heath Mayo, Founder of Principles First 
""Governor Hutchinson demonstrated his dedication to the Constitution that has been the foundation of his public service for years. With zero hesitation, he stood unwaveringly alone and ramrod straight when the topic of potentially supporting a convicted felon and constitutionally ineligible candidate came up. It was not lost on me his subtle acknowledgment of Israel by donning a U.S./Israel flag lapel pin, which starkly contradicts the ill-conceived policies of Donald Trump's favorite surrogate, Vivek Ramaswamy. If the GOP is serious about winning elections rather than catering to the extremes, then Asa Hutchinson is one of the better candidates and a serious contender for the Republican nomination."" — Olivia Troye, former Bush and Trump administrations national security official and current national security consultant
""Governor Hutchison used the debate as an opportunity to introduce himself to a national audience and draw attention to his substantial background at the highest level of government. His extensive background in law enforcement and border security is particularly timely. He is offering experience and integrity and running as a Reagan conservative. Voters learned more about him on debate night than ever before."" — Matt Mackowiak, Texas-based GOP consultant
""In Iowa, Governor Hutchinson is receiving very high praise for his conduct at the first debate. His demeanor was a welcome relief from the screaming match the debate devolved into. If you are looking for soundbites and shrill voices, look downstage. If you want to restore dignity to the office of the Presidency and for clear-eyed, pragmatic solutions to the complex issues facing America, look no further than Governor Hutchinson. I would expect the same at the next debate. If the winner of these debates is determined by who shouts the loudest and talks the longest rather than the individual who is truly prepared to lead our country, then thankfully that is not the contest Governor Hutchinson is interested in winning."" — Tim Coonan, Asa for America Iowa State Chair
""Governor Hutchinson offered up specific policy solutions and demonstrated an unwavering respect for the rule of law. Hutchinson provides our best opportunity to build a broad coalition of voters in the general election and bring conservative leadership back to the White House."" — Timothy Gilliam, Asa for America Kentucky State Chair
""Americans tuned into the first RNC Presidential Primary debate looking for a leader ready to do the job on day one. By remaining above the fray, Governor Hutchinson demonstrated to the American people that he has the temperament, resolve, and resume to serve as President of the United States of America. The Republican presidential primary is serious and should be treated as such. The American people are interviewing individuals to be the next leader of the free world, not a contestant on a reality show. Governor Hutchinson showed the American people that he takes this job seriously and is prepared to offer serious answers to questions. He will not disrespect voters or the highest office in our nation by participating in a shouting contest. When choosing who to support for president, the American people will appreciate that."" — Rob Burgess, Asa for America Campaign Manager

"Scott Campaign Press Release - Scott: ""My Candidacy Scares The Dickens Out Of The Radical Left""",2023-08-25T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-scott-my-candidacy-scares-the-dickens-out-the-radical-left,"
CONCORD, NH - Today, Tim Scott appeared on Fox News with Neil Cavuto to discuss why he is the candidate Democrats fear the most.
Today, Tim is meeting voters around New Hampshire. In the days to come, he will take his optimistic message across Iowa and his home state of South Carolina.
WATCH HERE
Neil Cavuto: Alright, that's popping up in an ad for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. And you might be resonating with your opponents, if your opponents are featuring you in their ads. The aforementioned Senator Tim Scott is kind enough to join us now. Senator, what do you think of that? You're the star in their latest ad.
Tim Scott: Well, Neil, obviously, my candidacy scares the dickens out of the radical left without any question. It's one of the reasons why they have me featured in their ad. When you bring out the former President Obama, and now you have the Biden-Harris ticket featuring me in their ads, it tells you what the polls have shown for several weeks now. That I'm the most likely Republican candidate to beat Joe Biden, I'm looking forward to being that candidate. I'm looking forward to being the next president of the United States. I'm also looking forward to making sure that we have a 15-week federal limit stopping abortions after 15 weeks. That is in all of our best interests. 72% of Americans agree with that position.
Neil Cavuto: ...They sense that this is an issue that will pull well for Democrats as it did in the last election. What do you think?
Tim Scott: Well, Neil, there's no doubt that they're looking for some, some, some genie in a bottle, some rabbit in the hat to try to find a way to bring Joe Biden across the finish line. First, it will not happen in 2024. Here's what the American people are so frustrated with. They're frustrated with this culture of grievance that brings with it the drug of victimhood, the narcotic of despair. They want to get away from this victimhood mentality and get back to talking about basic issues affecting the average kitchen table in America today, Bidenomics leading the way. Thousands of dollars of lost spending power because Joe Biden drove inflation over the last two years, nearly 16% leading as you know, Neil to 12 consecutive Federal Reserve increases, meaning they've destroyed the ability for so many Americans to buy their first home. It means that the average family is paying 40% more for gas, 20% more for food, 20% more for electricity. That is devastating for households like I was raised in. But the border, our southern border, is still wide open, unsafe, insecure, because Joe Biden refuses to use the resources available to finish the wall. No, he's actually selling parts of the wall. It's ridiculous.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Turned Republican Rumble Into Campaign Momentum: Polls,2023-08-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-turned-republican-rumble-into-campaign-momentum,"
Washington Examiner by Misty Severi
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has turned her time on the Republican debate stage this week into momentum for her 2024 presidential campaign, new post-debate polls have indicated.
Although Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy have largely been perceived as the debate winners based on polling, Haley has seen the sharpest rise in support overall, according to a new post-debate poll from the Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight, and Ipsos.
The survey found 29% of respondents overall, who are primary voters, said they would consider voting for Haley before the debate, and 46% said they would consider voting for her after it was over. Haley's favorability rating among GOP primary voters also increased from 51% before the debate to 65% post-debate, according to the poll.
Haley's standout moments during Wednesday's debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, centered on her clashes with former Vice President Mike Pence and Ramaswamy. Haley's clash with Pence was on the controversial topic of abortion, claiming the Republican Party should treat the issue with respect.
""Let's treat this like the respectful issue that it is and humanize the situation and stop demonizing the situation,"" Haley told Pence. She also called for a ""consensus"" on a federal abortion ban and questioned if the GOP could agree ""that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?""
Haley, who is also the former ambassador to the United Nations, clashed with Ramaswamy over foreign policy after he claimed he is not in favor of supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia.
""This guy is a murderer, and you are choosing a murderer,"" Haley said about Ramaswamy's previous comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Under your watch, you will make America less safe. You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows.""
Haley's ability to hold her own ground while also attacking her opponents earned her a high favorability rating from Wisconsin independents. After the debate, her favorability rating rose to 85%, up from 61% before the debate, according to a poll from Democratic firm Navigator. The same poll also found that 45% of the survey takers named Haley the winner of the debate, followed by 24% for DeSantis.
Despite her positive debate performance, Haley still has an uphill battle to secure the Republican nomination. Before the debate, Haley ranked No. 5 in the conservative race, behind former President Donald Trump, DeSantis, Ramaswamy, and Pence. Trump, who chose not to partake in the debate despite qualifying, is heavily favored to win the nomination.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Who Are We Kidding? Nikki Haley Won on Brains and Experience,2023-08-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-who-are-we-kidding-nikki-haley-won-brains-and-experience,"
The Washington Post by Kathleen Parker
Hands down, Nikki Haley won the first GOP debate. And I don't say this just because she's a South Carolinian or because she was the only woman among the fiery pack of primary candidates. She was simply smarter (even smarter than you, Vivek), more sensible and more experienced — and it showed.
While the men onstage argued and hurled invectives — some of them, anyway — Haley was poised, precise and prepared. And I would add brave. It took courage to do what others, with the exception of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, refused to do: speak truth to Donald Trump's power.
She also called out her Republican colleagues for making Americans think a federal abortion ban is going to happen. The votes, 60 in the Senate to prevent a filibuster, aren't there, she said. On the debt crisis, she reminded everyone that the debt grew by about $8 trillion under Trump. And in a roundabout reference to Trump's lack of qualifications for another term, she said a president needs ""moral clarity."" Who else could she have meant?
Haley's tenure in Trump's Cabinet as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has been problematic at times, creating potential obstacles to her own presidential aspirations. But any questions about where her loyalties lie were answered in Milwaukee before a live audience of about 4,000 people, as she brought both her executive and foreign policy experiences to bear. A twice-elected governor, Haley oversaw removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds in 2015 following the murders of nine Black congregants at a famous civil rights-era church in Charleston. As U.N. ambassador, she didn't need a learning curve and executed her job with polish, if not everyone's approval.
Wearing a pale blue knit suit on Wednesday night, she shed her gloves but kept the pearls, so to speak. I cheered just a little when she schooled Vivek Ramaswamy about the importance of Ukraine to the United States. The youngest candidate, at 38, Ramaswamy argued that we should redirect resources from Ukraine to our southern border. Haley vehemently disagreed, saying that a win for Russia is a win for China (true) and, therefore, Ukraine is important to our national interests. ""You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,"" she said.
Ramaswamy, whom I once considered the most interesting candidate, mainly echoed the policies of The-One-Who-Was-Missing, whom he described as the best president of the 21st century. Young, telegenic, wicked smart and a self-made billionaire, he is the new conservative superstar. But something about him is off. Maybe it's the arrogance, the stylish braggadocio, the smarter-than-thou attitude. Or the way he uses his dazzling, ultra-bright smile to convey disdain or to deflect.
It's all too much. Most of the others attacked him on various grounds but did so primarily because he's polling higher than they are. I doubt he has gone unnoticed by Trump, who could find him reminiscent of his younger self. A possible running mate?
And then there were Those-Who-Also-Spoke. For ease of note taking, I made a list of the candidates and assigned to each a descriptive word or two. They were Smarty, Deacon, Jerk, Gramps, Brows, Sweetie, Humdrum and Grumpy. You can probably figure out who's who, and there's a reason for that. Though often silly, nicknames reflect a memorable characteristic or impression. Public speakers know that audiences might not recall what you say but they'll remember how you made them feel.
While Smarty — Haley — made me feel like I was in competent company, Pence reminded me of every Presbyterian deacon I ever knew growing up. I kept expecting him to pass the plate. Ramaswamy, No. 3 above, made me want to punch him in the nose, which is a figure of speech and not a threat. Former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson seemed gramp-y and made me sleep-y. Even when he called for lethal force against bad guys bringing fentanyl into our country, I kept picturing him and President Biden slurping ice cream cones at South of the Border.
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will forever be a set of eyebrows, but he gets a pass for now since he was probably in considerable pain from a torn Achilles' tendon the day before the debate. It's a wonder he showed up at all and reinforces the association between thick brows and high levels of testosterone.
Sen. Tim Scott, also of South Carolina, is the sweetest man on the planet and is not too good to be true. He is both true and good to the bone. But in the current political climate, I'm not sure the audience can hear him. Humdrum Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was a drip. Bouncing between unanswered questions and rehearsed repeats, he defied rumors of his high intelligence. More damning, either he doesn't like people, or he doesn't know how to act around them, as a species. As Woody Allen said, the brain is the most overrated organ. Not that this is a problem for today's GOP, with a few notable exceptions.
That brings us back to Christie, who took the boos in stride when he said we have to stop normalizing Trump's noxious behavior. It's hard to look happy even so, and Grumpy, after all, was the role he chose.

MILWAUKEE, WI - Tonight, Tim Scott joined Fox News' Hannity following the first GOP debate.
Watch here
Sean Hannity: You're on the stage tonight. How did you feel?
Tim Scott: I felt really good. I felt like I wanted to have a conversation, an adult conversation, about why America can do for anyone what she's done for me. We need to focus on restoring hope, creating opportunities, and protecting America. We didn't spend enough time talking about the challenges we have at our southern border. We didn't talk long enough about the challenges that we have with China. It's not the strength of China, it's the weakness of Biden, that's the problem that we face as a nation. We need to dig into some of the most important, consequential issues facing the American people, and not have a food fight on the stage.

Milwaukee, WI - Right after dominating the stage at the first Republican Primary Presidential debate, Ron DeSantis joined Sean Hannity live on Fox News. Read the highlights below.

Watch the full interview HERE.
On his optimism for bringing our country back from decline:
I think the nation is in decline. But this decline is a choice. And we're going to make this choice over the next 18 months. We can reverse the decline, or we can restore America...In some respects, we can point out all the bad things and there's a lot of bad things, but I am optimistic that it can be done. You know why? Because we did it in Florida. Everything I laid out in Florida we accomplished, and the state has boomed. We can do the same thing for the US.
On his ability to get things done and follow through on his promises:
I think that there's a lot of people that get elected, [and] they over promise, under deliver when times get really tough. There's a lot of people that aren't going to stay in the fire. What I did in Florida, particularly during COVID, making sure the kids can be in school, protecting everyone's business, as I stand my ground for you, you can take that to the bank. I am not going to back down. I've taken on the left, the Democrats and the media and we've beaten all those people. And I think that in Florida, part of the reason I did so well is because people knew where I stood and they knew, ‘look, if the governor says he's going to do something, he's going to do it. He doesn't just make idle promises when he says it will do it.' So I think that's the same thing as President. I'm campaigning on a bold agenda, but I'm not saying anything that I don't intend to follow through with.
On how he'll earn the nomination:
I'm loyal to my family, the Constitution and the Lord our God. I work with other politicians to advance a common agenda, but nobody's entitled to be endorsed or supported. You've got to earn that. And I would mind you, you know, he started attacking me before I even got into the before I even got reelected. He started to do it. So that's fine. But at the end of the day, we're going to do what we need to do.
On his plan to secure our border and stop the invasion:
When I talk about using the military to take on the drug cartels, because they're killing tens of thousands of our citizens, we have every right to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm not just going to get in the office and say forget about it, so people should know that. Now's the time to get it done. I think our country, if we get another four years of this, I don't know if we can recover.

""The people who benefit the most from the food fight are the media and Joe Biden."" - Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC - Today, Tim Scott joined Fox News' Faulkner Focus following the first GOP debate to discuss his debate performance and his time on the campaign trail.
In the days to come, Tim is taking his message of restoring hope and creating opportunity directly to voters in New Hampshire, Iowa, and his home state of South Carolina.
Watch here
Tim Scott:  It was an exciting time last night. I'm so excited to be still here in Milwaukee, heading to New Hampshire next, but I'll say no doubt, the people who benefit the most from the food fight are the media and Joe Biden. We need to have a serious conversation about the priorities of the American people. We need to reassure this nation that we are not in decline, but under President Biden, we're in retreat. We need to break the backs of the teacher's unions so that every child and every zip code has a quality education. That means a parent has a choice and a kid has the best chance for the rest of their lives. ...
Tim Scott: I'm going to continue to make sure that I provide the American people with an adult in the room having a conversation about their priorities. Certainly the more you interrupt, the more time you get. But frankly, the more that helps Joe Biden. What I'm gonna do is focus on those issues that set captives free. I'm talking about a kid who's born in poverty, who realized the American dream. Because America is the solution, not the problem. You heard people on the stage last night refer to America as a part of the problem because we're a nation in decline. We are a nation in retreat because Joe Biden has us as a nation in retreat. As the next President of the United States, I'll be standing proud and strong on the fact that the windshield of America's future is a whole lot better than the rear view mirror of our past.

BROOKFIELD, WI - Ron DeSantis this morning joined Brian Kilmeade on Fox and Friends live from The Original Pancake House in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The hit was just hours after DeSantis dominated the stage at the first Republican Primary Presidential debate. The highlights are below.
DeSantis also joined the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox Radio to discuss how he will appear at the Field of Dreams in Dyersville, IA tonight.

Watch the full Fox and Friends interview HERE.
On last night's debate:
100% of my time was talking about our vision for the future and my accomplishments. And so there's a lot of people up there that said a lot of things. I'm the only one that's actually delivered on all these issues, whether it's economy, whether it's the crime, the border, you name it. And so looking forward, those are the issues that we were really strong on, the issues that people really care about. Look, we're auditioning to be the President of the United States. I'm not here to get into a food fight. If someone came after me, I was ready to go loaded for bear. We were going to respond and put that to bed. But I was more interested in talking directly to the people at home rather than some of the bickering that was back and forth.
On his plan to secure our border and stop the invasion:
You as Commander-in-Chief have a responsibility to fight back and to defend the people of this country. And you look at the body count now from the fentanyl that's coming in, it's over 100,000. People are overdosing on drugs, tens of thousands from fentanyl. We now have a collection around the country of what's called angel moms, so these are mothers that have lost kids to fentanyl overdose. I've had a chance to meet with a lot of them. You know, these are kids that may take like a Xanax or something... but here's the thing. That's giving them the death penalty if it's done with fentanyl. It's going to stop when I'm president. We're going to treat the cartels like the foreign terrorist organizations they are.
On combatting China and protecting US interests:
The problem is, Biden, he views China as a client, not as an adversary, and so we need to surge more resources there. Under my administration, our defense posture will be the Indo-Pacific will be the primary, Europe is going to have to do more. In Europe, we'll work with them, they're allies, but we don't have adequate resources to be able to provide worldwide security. We have to face that fact, and we have to do what we take to deter the China threat.
On focusing on the future:
It's not about some of these past things. It's about the country's future, and that's got to be the sole focus. And if we as Republicans are focused on that, holding Biden accountable, we are going to win. If we litigate the whole issue about what happened on January 6, which is what the media and the Dems want, then Biden's going to be in his basement again, and he's going to get away with it.
On how his military background prepares him to lead as Commander-in-Chief:
I'm doing things on behalf of the people. It's not about me. I don't like talking about myself, but I do think people want to know more about you. I mentioned last night at the debate, I served, I volunteered to serve in Iraq. I was attached to US Navy SEALs...I worked hard as a blue-collar kid to get degrees from Yale and Harvard. I could have made a lot of money, but I was inspired by 9/11. And so I volunteered to serve. [I] didn't have to do it. But I believed in this country, so people appreciate that. They also appreciate to know that I'm family-oriented with our three kids. And then they do like the fact that, you know what? This kid's gritty. He's a guy that had to work as a kid to get through places. He didn't have anything handed to him. That's really [what] America is about. If you work hard, you can get ahead. We're losing that as a country. And that's one of the reasons why I'm running.

These officials from Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, and Tennessee join hundreds of others nationwide supporting DeSantis.
DeSantis now boasts over 300 state-level endorsements, the most of any candidate in the race, in an impressive show of strength and grassroots enthusiasm DeSantis is building across the country.
""Hardworking Americans are getting hammered by Joe Biden's radical policies and rising prices. We need a president who understands how to rebuild the American Dream and fight for the middle class. Ron DeSantis has the vision, experience, and energy to reverse our economy's decline and make life affordable for working families,"" said Tennessee State Representative Gino Bulso.
""Governor Ron DeSantis is the conservative warrior who can reverse our nation's decline and revive America. As a resident of Gavin Newsom's California, I know too well the ruinous costs of progressive lunacy. Only Ron DeSantis can restore sanity,"" said California Assemblyman Joe Patterson.
""As a mom and Illinois State Senator, I am concerned about what our children are being taught in the classroom and what kind of country they will inherit.

More than 20 state officials endorse DeSantis following first GOP debateWashington ExaminerJulia JohnsonAugust 24, 2023
Over 20 state- and county-level officials endorsed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) for president on Thursday following his performance at the Republican National Committee's primary debate on Wednesday night.
DeSantis boasts more than 300 state-level endorsements, with the campaign prioritizing key early caucus and primary states, as well as those emerging as pivotal battlegrounds in 2024. According to the campaign, over 11,000 Iowans have committed to caucus for the Florida governor at the state's first-in-the-nation Republican caucuses on Jan. 15.
The 21 new endorsements hail from 10 states, including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Georgia — where his biggest primary opponent, former President Donald Trump, is set to be booked in jail on Thursday.
Those who issued new endorsements for DeSantis are Arkansas state Reps. Zack Gramlich, Aaron Pilkington, and Ryan Rose; California Assemblymen Joe Patterson and Tom Lackey; Colorado state Sen. Larry Liston; Georgia state Rep. Jodi Lott; Illinois Senate Deputy Republican Leader Sue Rezin; Kansas state Reps. Susan Humphries, Sandy Pickert, and Kristey Williams; Mississippi state Sen. Chris Caughman and state Rep. Fred Shanks; Tennessee state Reps. Gino Bulso, Dale Carr, and Jason Zachary; Bexar County Commissioner Grant Moody in Texas; and Washington state Mayors Dick Muri and Jon Nehring, state Rep. Chris Corry, and state Sen. Phil Fortunato.
According to a statement from Bulso of Tennessee, ""Hardworking Americans are getting hammered by Joe Biden's radical policies and rising prices. We need a president who understands how to rebuild the American dream and fight for the middle class. Ron DeSantis has the vision, experience, and energy to reverse our economy's decline and make life affordable for working families.""
""Governor Ron DeSantis is the conservative warrior who can reverse our nation's decline and revive America. As a resident of Gavin Newsom's California, I know too well the ruinous costs of progressive lunacy. Only Ron DeSantis can restore sanity,"" California's Patterson added in his own statement.
""As a mom and Illinois State Senator, I am concerned about what our children are being taught in the classroom and what kind of country they will inherit. Ron DeSantis is the only candidate who can be trusted to fight for my family the same way he fights for his and I am proud to endorse him for president,"" Rezin said in announcing her support.
The new endorsements come as the DeSantis campaign homes in on building up foundations of state-level support across the country. His campaign said the Florida governor boasts the most announced state-level endorsements of any Republican primary candidate, but Trump's campaign disputed this. Trump leads the way with prominent federal endorsements, such as those from governors, congressmen, and senators.
The Florida Republican is headed back to the campaign trail in Iowa, not wasting any time after the RNC debate. He will be hitting South Carolina next week, headlining Rep. Jeff Duncan's (R-SC) ""Faith and Freedom BBQ.""
During the Wednesday night debate, DeSantis took several opportunities to remind viewers of his track record in Florida. He emphasized his administration's work to remove critical race theory and gender ideology in schools in the Sunshine State, claiming, ""I stood for our kids.""
DeSantis also slammed Trump and fellow debater former Vice President Mike Pence for their actions during the COVID-19 national emergency, saying a national lockdown was a mistake. He further hit them for listening to former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci during the pandemic.
DeSantis had a different approach to the pandemic, lifting restrictions relatively early in Florida, and he promised the audience he would ""never let the deep state ... lock you down.""

I came to the conclusion that, America can do for anyone what she's done for me. If we focus on restoring hope, creating opportunities and protecting America, if we want the environment to be better, and we all do, the best thing to do is to bring our jobs home from China. If we create 10 million new jobs in my Made in America plan, we will have a better economy and a better environment. Let me tell you why I say that......America has cut- I'm a southern boy, I talk slow. America has cut our carbon footprint in half in the last 25 years. So, places where they are continuing to increase, Africa at 950 million people, India over a billion, China over a billion. Why would we put ourselves at a disadvantage? Devastating our own economy? Let's bring our jobs home.

Plus, 6 million illegal crossings since President Biden has taken office, and 200 people on our national security watchlists have been caught at our border. How many have not been caught at our southern border? If we just spent $10 billion we could finish the wall. For $5 billion more, we could have military-grade technology to surveil our southern border to stop the flow of fentanyl, and save 70,000 Americans a year. That should be the priority of this government, and as the next President of the United States, I will make that border wall complete.

Shows the nation that he is ready to beat Joe Biden and lead as Commander-in-Chief
Milwaukee, WI - Ron DeSantis dominated tonight's debate by laying out what he will do as President to reverse our nation's decline and revive the American Dream.
""Tonight, Ron DeSantis showed the nation that he is ready to beat Joe Biden, reverse our nation's decline, and revive the American Dream,"" DeSantis for President Campaign Manager James Uthmeier said. ""While other candidates attacked each other, Governor DeSantis stayed focused on the American people and fighting for their future with a clear vision to fix our economy, secure the border, empower parents, back law enforcement, and stand up to the leftist elites and the DC establishment. It is clear from tonight's debate that Ron DeSantis is the only candidate who has what it takes to fight – and win – against Joe Biden and the Democrats. Ron DeSantis won the night in Milwaukee, and we look forward to continuing to build on this momentum on the ground in Iowa and the rest of the early states.""
The top two moments of the night came when DeSantis talked about his plan to reverse Bidenomics so that middle class families have a chance to succeed again, and when he shared how his background as a Navy veteran will inform his leadership philosophy as president.
Watch DeSantis' answer on the economy HERE.

Our country is in decline. This decline is not inevitable. It's a choice. We need to send Joe Biden back to his basement and reverse American decline. And it starts with understanding we must reverse Bidenomics so that middle class families have a chance to succeed again, we cannot succeed as a country. If you are working hard and you can't afford groceries, a car or a new home while Hunter Biden can make hundreds of thousands of dollars on lousy paintings, that is wrong. We also cannot succeed when the Congress spends trillions and trillions of dollars. Those rich men north of Richmond have put us in this situation. And finally, we need to lower your gas prices. We're going to open up all energy production, we will be energy dominant again in this country. I showed it could be done in the state of Florida. I pledge to you as your President, we will get the job done and I will not let you down.""
Watch DeSantis' answer on his military background HERE.
""I'm somebody that volunteered to serve inspired by September 11. And I deployed to Iraq, alongside US Navy SEALs in places like Fallujah, Ramadi. It's something that I think has taught me... you know, when you go in that type of environment, anything you have - your personal agenda - you check it at the door. You go there, and it's about focusing on the mission, above all else. Guys come together and they get it done. That's how I would view being the President of the United States. It's not about me. It's not about all these other side issues. My sole focus will be on your future and reversing this country's decline.""

I'm a big believer in Ephesians 3:20, that God is able to do exceedingly, abundantly, above all that we ask or imagine. Our responsibility should be to model the behavior we want others to follow.

He told supporters: ""We are not going to let a bunch of rich men north of Richmond spend us into oblivion any longer. We're going to hold them accountable and we're going to stand up for the people of this country.""
DeSantis will travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Wednesday for the first Republican presidential primary debate hosted by the Republican National Committee.

Watch his full remarks HERE. On taking on the DC establishment:
""[Washington, DC's] policies hurt this country, their policies devalued our currency, it's made things more expensive. And we are not going to let a bunch of rich men north of Richmond spend us into oblivion any longer. We're going to hold them accountable and we're going to stand up for the people of this country. I'm sick of seeing five of the eight wealthiest counties in the United States are suburbs of Washington, DC. They spend, they borrow, you pay, and they benefit and that is wrong. That ends on January 20, 2025. And it's not just Democrats. to Republicans have spent and done it too. We're going to go after the lot of them we're going to go after both of them.""
On the failed federal response to the natural disaster in Maui and his plan to take on Joe Biden:
""I'm sure you all have been sending prayers and thoughts to what's happened in Maui. It's really sad to see. We've sent support, we'll send more if we need to... If we had a Republican president, who, in the midst of these fires and their aftermath, decided not to go engage to help the victims, but to go sit on the beach, what would the media say if they tried to do that? They would be they would be screaming bloody murder. And yet, what do they say about old Joe just sitting out there? They don't say anything. They protect him. That's what they're trying to do. And so here's what we've got to make sure about in 2024: I am not going to let him sit in his basement and get away with it again, we are going to run him ragged around this country, we're going hold them accountable for his failures, we're going to show the American people that there's a better way. And we know that there's a better way.""
On firing bureaucrats like Dr. Fauci:
""When I'm President, you will never see me turning over my office to Dr. Fauci. You don't protect Fauci, you don't coddle Fauci, you bring somebody like Fauci in, you sit him down, and you say, ‘Anthony, you are fired.'""
On how he will reverse the decline of the country:
""Leadership is important. Leadership is something that you need, you either have it or you don't. And you got to be willing to, to withstand a lot of incoming, a lot of unfair attacks. But if it was easy to be a leader, and to do the right thing, everybody would do it. We're proud that we planted our flag here, that we kept this state free. We would do it all over again and take twice as much abuse if we needed to do it. You can count on me when we go up to Washington, because here's the deal: nobody in Washington is going to want to see us succeed.""

Statement by Will Hurd on the First RNC Debate,2023-08-22T00:00:00+00:00,Will Hurd,/documents/statement-will-hurd-the-first-rnc-debate,"
Tied With Pence and Haley, but Left Off the Debate Stage
Republican presidential candidate and former Texas Rep. Will Hurd released the following statement regarding the status of his campaign and the Republican National Convention's (RNC) upcoming debate:
""I was the last candidate to enter this race. My team and I met the 40,000 donor threshold in less than 60 days without any gimmicks. We registered in eight reputable national polls and eight reputable state polls. We are close to crossing the 50,000 donor threshold, and in New Hampshire, I'm tied with the former vice president and United Nations ambassador, who have much higher name ID.
""The lack of transparency and confusion around the RNC's debate requirements is antithetical to the democratic process. The polling standards are arbitrary, unclear, and lack consistency. This is an unacceptable process for a presidential election. The American people deserve better.
""The RNC discounted polls that included independents and Democrats willing to vote for a Republican. If the GOP is looking to grow our electorate and beat Joe Biden, then we better have a clear understanding of what qualifies as a likely Republican voter. Anyone, regardless of party, who is willing to check the box for a Republican should be considered a 'likely Republican voter.' Expanding our party should be applauded, not penalized.
""I have said from day one of my candidacy that I will not sign a blood oath to Donald Trump. The biggest difference between me and every single candidate who will be on the debate stage in Milwaukee is that I have never bent the knee to Trump. It's disappointing being kept off the debate stage, but I will not be deterred. The stakes are too high.""

""Just like he fought for me, he fought for the people of this state""
Tallahassee, FL - Ron and Casey DeSantis sat down with Harris Faulkner for a ""Families in Focus"" interview that aired on Fox News' Faulkner Focus today. Read the highlights below.

Watch the full interview HERE.
First Lady Casey DeSantis on what defines her as First Lady of Florida:
_ I think one who looks at the role with a lot of humility, right? It isn't about me. It is about being in a position to be able to do good on behalf of the people of this state and hopefully of this country._
First Lady Casey DeSantis on her Hope Florida initiative:
We've been able to transition off either partly or entirely more than 8,100 people from government assistance because they're on a pathway to economic self-sufficiency. They're now in homes on their own. They're cooking for their children, literally in tears because this is the first time that they have a roof over their home, over their house that they've been able to get on their own.
Governor DeSantis on First Lady Casey DeSantis' battle with cancer:
I did my role as what a good husband should do, but she really fought hard. And I'll tell you, once we went public with it, the amount of prayers that we got from Florida and around the country really boosted her spirit and my spirit.
First Lady Casey DeSantis on her battle with cancer:
The day that I ultimately found out, it was Ron who was the one that told me because I couldn't listen to the doctors. I didn't want to hear any of the opining. I didn't know if I was going to see my kids graduate from kindergarten, let alone going off into high school or watching them walk down the aisle. So I had him every step of the way there as a shoulder to cry on.
Governor DeSantis on knocking doors with First Lady Casey DeSantis during his campaign:
When I first ran for Congress in 2012, she'd be knocking on doors, these Republican voter's doors, and just think about it. Like you're on TV. When people see you in person, it's kind of a big deal if they know you from TV. So literally someone that they see on the morning show shows up at their doorstep and they're like, wait a minute, I know you.
First Lady DeSantis on being a mother:
They're the first young family to live in the governor's mansion in about 60 years. Mamie is the first baby born in the governor's mansion in about 50 years, and so they have a unique perspective on life. They've always had the security detail around them. They think that that's just normal part of life, but they're having fun and they get a lot of neat opportunities. And also this is an opportunity for us to be able to teach our kids about what exactly we are fighting for.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - The Dishonest Media Refuses to Report the Facts,2023-08-21T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-the-dishonest-media-refuses-report-the-facts,"
Tallahassee, FL - The dishonest media refuses to report the facts surrounding Ron DeSantis' comments. Governor DeSantis challenged all of us in the conservative movement to be focused on substance and based in principle. Each candidate competing for our party's nomination for president should be held to these standards as they seek to earn every one of our votes. Here is the full transcript of DeSantis' remarks:
“So there will be people who are huge Trump supporters, like in Congress, who have incredibly liberal left-wing records that is really just atrocious, and yet they're viewed by some of these folks as like, really, really good. Then you have other people, you know, like a Congressman Chip Roy, who has endorsed me, Congressman Thomas Massie. These guys have records of principle fighting the swamp that are second to none. And yet, they will be attacked by some of these people and called RINOs. So it's just been totally detached from any type of substance. And ultimately, a movement can't be about the personality of one individual. The movement has got to be about what are you trying to achieve on behalf of the American people? And that's got to be based in principle. Because if you're not rooted in principle, if all we are is listless vessels that are just supposed to follow whatever happens to come down the pike on Truth Social every morning, that's not going to be a durable movement.”
“The dishonest media refuses to report the facts—Donald Trump and some congressional endorsers are ‘listless vessels.' Why? Because Trump and DC insiders feel he is entitled to your vote. Ron DeSantis believes your trust should be earned and has the vision, plan, and record to beat Joe Biden and reverse the decline of our country. That's why Ron DeSantis will be showing up on Wednesday night to debate, and Donald Trump will not.” - Press Secretary Bryan Griffin

Ron DeSantis today joined The Story with Martha MacCallum on Fox News Channel. The highlights are below.

Watch the full interview HERE.
On the importance of standing on principle:
Every Republican voter I've ever come into contact with, whether they're strong for Trump, lukewarm, or anything in between, wants us to stand on principle when you get elected...I think one of the big problems with our party for many years is people say they're going to do certain things and then don't end up following through. At the end of the day, it's what are we delivering for the people that have put us into office. And in the state of Florida, I can say that I have delivered more for American first principles than anybody else in the country. We've prohibited the CCP from purchasing land. We've cracked down on illegal immigration, expanded second amendment rights. We got indoctrination out of our schools. We have universal school choice and our crime rate is at a 50-year low because we've done things like remove Soros-backed district attorneys. So, that is about results. You've had the people in Congress that I was referring to that have attacked me and tried to say somehow that I was a RINO. They're putting entertainment and personality over principle. Our voters want us to stand on principle and fight for them.
On why Donald Trump should debate:
Everybody should debate. Everybody has a responsibility to earn people's votes. Nobody is entitled to anything in this world, less of all the Republican nomination for president. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be making the case, and this is really a great opportunity because I don't think very many people over the summer have been following that closely. This is going to be the first time that candidates are going to be able to speak unfiltered to a large number of Americans, so I'm going to make the case that under Joe Biden, this country is in decline. We need to send Biden back to his basement in Delaware and reverse the country's decline, and I'm the guy that can do it. We have proven it in the state of Florida, and I won't let people down as the next president.
On his support from Iowa voters:
We already have 99 counties organized with the political organization [and] close to 11,000 that have already committed to caucus with us, and we're just in the summer before. Most people aren't even paying attention yet, so we're going to earn it in the state of Iowa. And that poll that came out...it shows that I had the highest favorability of any of the Republican candidates, and that both Donald Trump and I were basically neck-and-neck in terms of who would they consider, so we're just going to go earn it, and we look forward to doing that over these next five months.
On what makes him the best candidate for President:
I started off in my life working minimum wage jobs. I mean, I was a blue collar kid. I didn't have anything handed to me. But I believed in America, you work hard, you can get ahead. That's what we should be showing people. We shouldn't be displaying a sense of entitlement.
On Why He is Running:
I can tell you this though, of anyone on that stage, I'm the only one whose sole purpose is running to be the 47th President of the United States and to reverse this country's decline. I'm not running to be vice president. I'm not running to be in the cabinet. And I'm not running to be a contributor on cable news. We're running to win and we're going to show people that we'll get the job done.

Hutchinson Campaign Press Release - Governor Hutchinson Qualifies For RNC Debate,2023-08-20T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/hutchinson-campaign-press-release-governor-hutchinson-qualifies-for-rnc-debate,"
Over 37,000 unique donors added since July 1
DES MOINES, Iowa — Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President as well as a former governor of Arkansas and official in President George W. Bush's administration, announced this morning his campaign has surpassed the 40,000 unique donor requirement to qualify for the Republican National Committee (RNC) Presidential Primary Debate in Milwaukee. Governor Hutchinson's campaign has submitted nearly 42,000 unique donors for verification with the RNC. Fulfillment of the donor requirement was the last element of qualification that Governor Hutchinson needed to reach as he had previously qualified when it came to polling.
""I am thankful to the tens of thousands of Americans who have contributed to my campaign and helped ensure my message of consistent, commonsense, conservative leadership is represented on the debate stage this Wednesday evening,"" said Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the 46th Governor of Arkansas and a current Republican candidate for President. ""I intend to continue speaking the truth when it comes to the responsibility that Donald Trump bears for the attacks on our democracy and justice system. I look forward to a substantive debate in Milwaukee.""
The RNC required presidential candidates to achieve at least 1% of registered support in two national polls and two early state polls, receive the financial support of 40,000 unique donors—which included at least 200 unique donors in each of 20 states—and sign a pledge.
Governor Hutchinson had 5,040 total donations from 4,148 unique donors at the end of the last quarter. Since July 1, he has added a total of 43,197 donations from an additional 37,116 unique donors. Additionally, Governor Hutchinson has received donations from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. Territories.
""Our campaign has always been about the American people and the belief that we can collectively bring out the best of America. I am thankful so many agree with me: it is time for us to elect a president with a forward-looking vision for our nation, whose gaze is set on the horizon . . . not the rearview mirror,"" concluded Gov. Hutchinson.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Scorches Biden on 2-year Anniversary of Afghanistan Withdrawal: 'World is Less Safe',2023-08-19T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-scorches-biden-2-year-anniversary-afghanistan,"
Fox News by Lawrence Richard
Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who is running for the 2024 presidency, said on Tuesday the world is ""less safe"" than it was two years ago before the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan, effectively handing over control of the country to the Taliban.
She also suggested President Biden should be personally held accountable for the withdrawal as 13 Americans – 11 Marines, one Army soldier and one Navy personnel – were killed during an attack on the Kabul airport in August 2021.
""Two years after the fall of Kabul and Joe Biden's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the world is less safe, our enemies are emboldened, and our allies are questioning America's commitments,"" a statement from her presidential campaign said.
""Two years ago, the world watched in horror as Joe Biden withdrew from Afghanistan in a way that betrayed our allies and emboldened our enemies,"" added Haley, also a former United Nations ambassador. ""Disaster followed. Thirteen American service members were killed, China grew increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan, Russia invaded Ukraine, and terrorists took over Afghanistan with the help of American equipment and supplies.""
She added: ""To date, no one has taken responsibility for the botched withdrawal. No one has been fired, and no one replaced. The families of the 13 murdered service members can't even get basic answers about what happened. In a Haley administration, there will be no mistaking where we stand. Our allies will know we have their backs, and our enemies will fear American strength.""
In August 2021, Biden oversaw the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, ending nearly a 20-year military presence in the country. The U.S. exit from Afghanistan prompted the Taliban to declare a total victory in the decades-long conflict.
Haley, who has become more vocal in her criticism of Biden as she seeks to be the Republican nominee to face him next November, previously slammed his administration for giving more than $2.35 billion in taxpayer dollars to Afghanistan as the funds likely ended up in the hands of the Taliban.
""Nearly two years after Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, he continues to add insult to injury by throwing taxpayer dollars at the Taliban-controlled country,"" Haley said in a statement last week. ""This is a terrorist regime that killed our troops and tortures its own people. When I'm president, we won't send one penny to terrorists and countries that hate America.""
Last year, on the first anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Haley warned ""America's Newsroom"" that President Biden was projecting a ""weak"" America on the world stage.
""The second that blunder happened in Afghanistan, it was the green light for every enemy we had. Then you saw Russia move into Ukraine. Then you saw China starting to threaten Taiwan,"" she said in 2022.
She added: ""That was the day America became weak. That was the day the world became less safe. And it was all because of the decisions the Biden administration made.""
While former President Donald Trump remains a clear front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, many of his supporters have expressed that they would be willing to back a different candidate.
A New York Times/Siena College poll published earlier this month found that 54% of Republican respondents are supporting Trump in his third presidential bid. However, 46% are still considering voting for a different candidate in 2024.
In addition to Trump and Haley, the crowded GOP primary field includes former Vice President Mike Pence, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
As of Monday, the only candidates who have qualified for the first primary debate are Haley, DeSantis, Scott, Ramaswamy and Burgum.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley: Inflation Reduction Act a 'Communist Manifesto',2023-08-19T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-inflation-reduction-act-communist-manifesto,"
NewsMax by Theodore Bunker
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, rebuked the Inflation Reduction Act on its anniversary as President Joe Biden's ""communist manifesto.""
Haley said in an email to supporters that the law has failed to reduce inflation and had increased U.S. dependence on China.
""The IRA is a communist manifesto filled with tax hikes and green subsidies that benefit China and make America more dependent on Beijing,"" Haley wrote in a statement Wednesday. ""While Joe Biden cozies up to Xi Jinping, American families are footing the bill for all this spending. As president, I will repeal Biden's green energy handouts and make sure Americans are not dependent on China for vital goods.""
Haley also said the focus on electric vehicles will make the U.S. more dependent on Chinese manufacturing for batteries.
Haley joins several prominent Republicans in speaking out against the IRA on its first anniversary, such as Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who said in a statement that the GOP members of the panel gave the law a failing grade.

On how being a dad impacts his policies:
Now in terms of how I see the world, it definitely impacts...the stuff we've done in education. I would have done this anyways as a governor, but the fact that I've got a six, a five and a three year old, we just started school Wednesday... So when you see things about indoctrination in the curriculum, when we had the fight against Disney about should there be sexualization of the curriculum in elementary school, of course, I think I always would have said no to that. But having the kids I'm like, H-E- double hockey sticks no. We're not doing that. I want to have school be school, I don't want an agenda shoved down their throat... so we definitely are sensitive to the rights of parents, the ability of parents to choose the best school and we have universal school choice in Florida now that we just enacted my most recent legislative session.
On the upcoming debate:
Who knows what'll end up happening? We'll be prepared either way. But I'm excited about doing it because most of what you do in this process is filtered through media. And seldom do you get the opportunity to speak directly to this many people. It'll probably be 10 million, maybe 50, who knows? Maybe even more. So gives you an opportunity to deliver your message, and then to answer questions that that are appropriate. I hope that we will be focused on the future of the country, rather than some of the other static that's out there right now. Because a lot of the static, a lot of the thing about looking backwards, that is not going to help us secure this border, that is not going to help these middle class families who are struggling [to] even afford groceries... not going to help them get better. It's not going to help us be able to rein in these federal agencies that have abused their power. It's not going to help with any of that. What'll help with all of that is if we're able to carry a message into the fall of 2024, holding Biden accountable for his failures and showing the American people how we're going to reverse this country's decline. And as the candidate, I will be able to do that free of a lot of the other static that's out there and a lot of the inclination to look backwards.
On his plan to secure the border:
We now have 10s of 1000s of people that are dying from fentanyl overdose that's all being brought in because the border is not secure, and the cartels have more control over our border so than we do. And that's just a lack of will. It's a lack of interest by our ruling class. When the illegals show up to Manhattan or Martha's Vineyard, they're showing up in neighborhoods where [these] liberal elites who have talked about open borders, they've talked about they should be sanctuary [cities]. But this has all just been virtue signaling because they never had to deal with the consequences of the policies. Then when they have to, they don't like it. One of the things that I said I'll do as president, which yes, we'll declare it a national emergency, I'm going to send military down there, we'll build a wall, we'll do remain in Mexico, stop the invasion, we'll do all that. But when you have cartels operating the way they are, they're operating as akin to foreign terrorist organizations, because they're killing our people. They're poisoning our people. So we're going to authorize the use of deadly force against the cartels. If you have somebody coming in with the fentanyl there, and the backpack, they even break through the border wall where there is wall. If they're doing that, that's the last thing they they're going to be able to do because we're going to leave them stone cold dead at the border. We're not putting up with it anymore.
On slaying the federal bureaucracy:
The Founding Fathers designed three branches of government. Executive, legislative, judicial. They did not design a fourth branch of government, an administrative state, that has now grown to where it's exercising authority over us with impunity, regardless in many instances of the outcomes of elections, and they're not held constitutionally accountable. So that creates bad things for society in terms of the policies that they're pursuing... And the question is, who governs? Do we govern ourselves? If we govern ourselves, that means that the things that affect your lives are voted on by your elected representatives, so that if you don't like what they're doing, you can show them the door. When it's done by nameless, faceless bureaucrats who will never stand for election, they're exercising power without proper accountability of We the American People. So we need to return the government back to We The People.
On countering growing threats from China:
I think just what we've seen with our national security posture is, we've got a problem on our hands with the Chinese Communist Party. This country embraced policies that really have empowered China for many, many decades. We were told that it made them more democratic, that it would be more markets for our manufacturing, even though China took most of our manufacturing, and that China would play by rules, but yet they manipulate their currency, they steal our technology, all that. So they're close to a peer competitive competitor of ours. Their economy may pass us within the next 10 years based on the current course and trajectory. That's a problem for us economically, because if they're the dominant economic power, that is going to be something that's going to be felt in the household of every American family, and it will affect our freedoms. But from a national security perspective, we've never had a competitor in our lifetimes that could match us economically. So now you're in a situation where you're not only dealing with somebody that would... maybe even surpass us economically, but that our economy has been dependent upon their economy, for things that are really important. You know, not just sneakers, we're getting pharmaceuticals, we're getting things that go into our defense, industrial base things that you really need with NASA for our national survival... We're a country with an economy, not the other way around. American people are not just cogs in the wheel of some global economic enterprise. You're American citizens citizens of a republic.
On what it's like to campaign as a family:
I've done 38 of the 99 counties [in Iowa]. The kids though have been with us at least half of those counties. So they're going around and they're going to a county fair in a really rural part of Iowa... going to pet some big cow... But those are just the things that you get to do when you're when you're with them. The kids love doing this. And we wouldn't want to put them through [it] if they didn't like it. They do like it. But for us, a lot of it's just being able to spend time with them. Because you know, we could be in Tallahassee spending time with them, great. If we're somewhere else, you know, we want to do that. And so it's really been fun to be able to make that happen.

On countering threats from China:
China is our top national security threat, and it's not even close. I think that there's other threats out there, don't get me wrong. But China has the second strongest military in the world, they have the second biggest economy. On this current course, under Biden's policies, they're going to surpass our economy this decade in size. And that creates a huge problem, because we've never had a peer competitor in our lifetime that had a bigger economy than we did. I mean, the Soviet Union, during the Cold War, their economy was a fraction of ours, even the Axis powers during World War Two, they were not at the level of the Allied powers. And so this would present for us a huge threat. And then compounding that, that our economy is intertwined with theirs, largely because we've had elites in DC and in New York who have pushed this over many decades... So this decade, I think is the decisive decade. Are we going to maintain our economic superiority? That means we've got to do strategic decoupling from China. We can't just keep sending them all this industry, have everything important made over there... If China does surpass us, and they become the dominant power in the world, that will affect the lives of every single American family. I mean, you see how much power they wield already, that would go up tremendously. And how would they have a vision of society, they would want society to function on things like social credit scores, where you're evaluated based off whether you're bending the knee to the party in power, and it's not just about your individual freedom, and their vision of society is one that would be very dark. And it would be something that would be totally inconsistent with our inherited freedoms here in the United States. And so this is an important struggle. I think, if we do what we need to do to deter them militarily, economically, and if we get serious about some of the stuff they're doing culturally, I think we can win the decade and I think we can ensure that this is an American Century, not a Chinese century.
On combatting ESG and woke corporations:
So this ESG is environment, social governance, and it's a relatively recent phenomenon, where they say that companies and businesses should adopt so-called ESG principles. Long story short, all that is is cover for companies and asset managers to be able to advance an ideological agenda, and it's a left-wing ideological agenda. And so for example, while the top Wall Street banks can get together and decide, they don't want to provide financing for people that have gun stores, and now it's already bad... that is not government, infringing your Second Amendment rights, but when you have these major power centers doing that, that is an infringement on your rights. They are changing policy, other companies trying to change our culture. So they're wielding power in ways that absolutely can erode our freedoms, that can change society, and that can change culture. So in Florida, we eliminated ESG from the state. In terms of our pension investing, we took $2 billion away from Blackrock who had been investing some of the Florida pension money because Blackrock is pursuing this type of social activism through the economy. And then we've banned things like social credit scores in Florida, and also prohibited woke banking.
On Florida's response to COVID and holding the bureaucracy accountable:
I think the lock downs were one of the most catastrophic mistakes this country has made in the modern history of the United States. And in fact, if you look at all the economic pain that people are feeling with how much groceries costs, the interest rates now going to be 8%, for 30 year mortgage or close to it. And all along down the line, the start of that was shutting down the economy in March of 2020, of turning the country over to Dr. Anthony Fauci, because it disrupted our labor market... they passed the Cares Act, which was over $2 trillion of printed and borrowed money that got put into the economy. The Fed started putting more money into the economy and it set the stage for the inflation that we see now, to this day... I think for a lot of the policies that lock kids out of school for a whole year, in places like California and Chicago, a bureaucrat like Fauci should not have that type of power. And what should have happened is he shouldn't have been coddled, he shouldn't have been able to be out on a platform, spewing his nonsense, he should have been fired. And if Fauci would have been fired, I think that that would have helped open up the rest of the country a lot sooner than what ended up happening. And instead, Fauci kept on and he was in there for another couple of years, doing a lot of damage to this country, but we have to acknowledge that the country made a catastrophic mistake. And as President, I've pledged [that] we're gonna hold the people accountable who lied to the public on all these things, whether it's lock downs, mass mRNA vaccines, people at the CDC, FDA, they did a horrific job. We're gonna bring accountability, because we can never let this happen in our country ever again.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Good Morning New Hampshire,2023-08-18T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-good-morning-new-hampshire,"
Ron DeSantis joined Jack Heath on Good Morning New Hampshire. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On campaigning the Granite State:
If you want to know how politics works, just look at, who is the one that people are going after. And I'm basically the one that the current president is going after, the Vice President is going after, the former president is going after, and all these other Republicans are going after. So I think that's an indication that people understand that we have the ability to beat Joe Biden and bring all these important things to fruition. And New Hampshire, you know, this is something--you got to be in these communities. We did a four-day swing at the end of July, beginning of August. We were doing house parties, we did a town hall on WMUR, I spoke at a rotary club. You got to do that over and over over the next six months. And I'm committed to doing that. We're going to work hard. I want to get in front of as many New Hampshire voters as I can. And what we've found is when people get to see me, they say, 'oh, man, you know, you're really good. You're nothing like what the media says about you.' And so that shows that we have to. We got a lot of work to do, but we are going to be successful. And I look forward to continuing to do it. And you know, the thing about it, when you're in a place like New Hampshire, you hear what the national corporate media always obsesses and wants to talk about, and it's like you're in another world when you're talking to just normal New Hampshire voters. Because they're actually concerned about the issues that affect this country's future. And those are their concerns, and they want to hear how you're going to address all these great challenges that our country has. And so I really enjoyed going. We're going to do more in August, of course, as you said, but I think after Labor Day, I think you're gonna start to see a lot of the voters in New Hampshire start to key in on the race a little bit more.
On the upcoming debate:
I think the most important thing is, is deliver the message that our country is in decline across a variety of fronts, including the economy, military, and our culture. And the reason I'm running for president is to reverse this decline and get this country on a better path going forward. And that's autonomy, border, energy, national security, all these things that I'm sure we'll talk about in the debate. But part of the reason people know that I'm the guy that can beat Biden, and that can actually get this done, is because I did it in Florida. Most people that run for office over-promise and under-deliver. I made bold commitments to the people. And I actually not only met the commitments, I over-delivered on my promises, and have been able to win a landslide victory in a state that's been very competitive. So that's a formula that we can take nationally. And Republicans need to win again, we've developed a culture of losing in this party. We can turn it around, but the time for excuses is over. We're either going to get it done in 2024, or we're going to have a lot of problems in this country over the next four years.
On his plan to secure the border:
Open border does not work. We know that. Even New York City mayor is acknowledging you can't be a sanctuary jurisdiction. The fact that she's doing the state of emergency in Massachusetts shows this doesn't work. So let's shut this border down. Stop the invasion. Yes, I'm going to build the border wall, but I'm going to have the military at the border, and I'm going to go after these Mexican drug cartels. They're bringing fentanyl in. I met a lady down in Texas, her son died from a fentanyl overdose, and then another lady in Florida who was sexually assaulted by a criminal alien who came in over the border under Joe Biden, so this has got to stop. So we're going to have military on the border. If a cartel member has fentanyl or something and they're trying to break into our country, we're using deadly force. They're going to end up stone cold dead. And you know what, if they see that kind of push back, the cartels are going to think twice before they take advantage of our country going forward. But what's happened has been humiliating for our country. You talk about a country that's on the downswing, when we cede control of our borders to Mexican drug cartels, that is pathetic. And that stops with the day I become president.

"Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott At Erick Erickson's The Gathering: ""I'm Living Proof The American Dream Is Alive""",2023-08-18T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-erick-ericksons-the-gathering-im-living-proof-the,"
""I am living proof that the American dream is alive and it is well, and that no matter where you start in this country, if you work hard, work on your character, have strong grit, all things are possible."" – Tim Scott
ATLANTA, GA –  This morning, Tim Scott joined Erick Erickson at The Gathering conference. During the conversation he discussed why he is running for president, the Lefts' attacks of his candidacy, and why he is the strongest candidate to beat Joe Biden.
Watch: Tim Scott on why he is running for president.
Erick Erickson: Why should Americans vote for you for president?
Tim Scott: You know, I think, great question, Eric. Perhaps the most important reason is I think God wastes none of the characteristics he's given us. I was blessed to be bald at 57 years old by the good Lord, and one of the things I say is that the truth of my life disproves the lies of the radical Left. I am living proof that the American dream is alive and it is well, and that no matter where you start in this country, if you work hard, work on your character, have strong grit, all things are possible. I'm a big believer in Ephesians 3:20, that God is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above all that we ask or imagine. And when you're a kid growing up in a single parent household, mired in poverty, you look around and you don't see any real reasons to be optimistic about your future.
Learning from a mother, the power of work, learning from a mentor that all things are possible. And yes, having a job is good, but creating jobs is better. Having an income, you've done well. But if you can create a profit, you can change your community. Having the ability to look at the Left, the far radical Left and say that what I have experienced as a person in this amazing country is in fact proof that the lies that you're selling — weaponizing race and class whenever you're losing an argument — you can't do that with me. Literally, I find myself in a position where having had a miserable beginning and succeeded as a catalyst for why we should believe that America's best days are still ahead of her, number one.
...
Erick Erickson: One of the very first and most frequently asked questions from the crowd for you is, what was it like to go to The View?
Tim Scott: You know, that's a really good question. It was a fascinating experience for them and it was an interesting experience for me.
People think because I'm optimistic and positive that maybe I'm just a nice guy. And that's all. The truth is that when you say something that is disgusting, offensive and undeniably wrong, I'm the guy you don't wanna watch. And going on The View to have a conversation about their comments and going toe to toe with Whoopi and the rest of the hosts. Unfortunately, Joy ""Blackface"" Behar did not decide to show up for the conversation she started. I look forward to that kind of conflict because I wanna resolve the issue. You don't have to be an exception if you're an African American to succeed in this world, all you have to do is go as high as your character and your grit and your hard work will take you. That's the truth of where we are as a nation.
...
People judged me on the content of my character, not the color of my skin. We need to get that right and tell the whole story of American progress. That's why I'm so excited to go on shows like The View or have one of my first town halls in a black church in a small town. I want people to understand that conservatism works. It doesn't work for the rich, it doesn't work for the poor, it doesn't work for the black, it doesn't work for the white, it works for America. Because we are applying judicial Christian foundations and principles, and when they permeate the soils of our land, the greatest things happen related to that.
Watch: Tim Scott on why the radical Left fears him the most
Erick Erickson: You're the only Republican candidate that former President Obama felt the need to call out. Why do you think that there, he and the Left are just so fundamentally threatened by your success?
Tim Scott: Well, the polls suggest that I'm the best candidate on our side to beat President Biden, number one. Number two, when you are the former President Obama, and you're looking at a guy that looks like me talking about the goodness of America and the progress of our nation, and the fact that education is the closest thing to magic, and if we are looking at the future of this nation, it's not the color of your skin, but it is the quality of your education, that kind of ruffles the feathers on the Left. Their entire identity politics falls apart when we recognize that we've come so far as a nation, that our future will be determined by the quality of your education. And if we had school choice in every single zip code, if parents had a choice, the kids would have a chance. That's America's future.
They can't hardly stand it. They do not like the truth spoken on big screens called TVs, or little screens called iPads. Because we've made so much progress as a nation, we should spend less time in the rear view mirror and more time in the big windshield of the future of this nation. And what President Obama sought to do was to drag us back in the past that no longer exists, so that we eliminate the future. Let's define and decide the future for ourselves. Let's empower our kids, not with indoctrination, but with education. Let's get back to the good old fashioned A, B, and Cs and let's eliminate CRT. Those thoughts ruin the Left. So they have to attack immediately, always attacking the infancy of a candidacy. You wanna destroy the kid, or the  candidacy early on. It's wrong.

""Just 55 days after entering the race, my team and I crossed the 40,000 donor qualification required for the first GOP debate. I was the last candidate to enter the Republican primary field and we were able to accomplish this goal with speed, without using tricks or gimmicks while spending far less than many of my opponents to do so. As I have said since day one of my campaign—I am not looking to peak within the first 100 days of entering the race, I am looking to peak before the first election. Meeting this first milestone is a great feat for my team and our supporters, but I am not taking my foot off the gas. I look forward to being on the debate stage in Wisconsin.""

Exclusive: Ron DeSantis on Fatherhood, Parents' Rights, and the 2024 Campaign
TIME
Molly Ball
August 16, 2023
To hear Ron DeSantis tell it, his message hasn't changed. ""I think we were viewed, really from Day One, as the candidate that had the strong record on the issues important to parents,"" he tells me, sitting at a table in a shaded pavilion on the sidelines of the Iowa State Fair. ""It has been an issue, really, from the beginning,"" he says of the ""parents' rights"" agenda that has been central to his struggling presidential candidacy. ""And so I do think we've tapped into that, and we'll continue to do it.
… As governor of Florida, DeSantis says, education policy is part of his purview, but it's also personal. ""I also just see it through the lens of a dad of a six, five and three-year-old,"" he says, before switching to his usual first-person-plural. ""We understand some of the things that parents are concerned about and that parents are going through. And that impacts how we view these policies, particularly when it goes to things like parents' rights to be involved in the education."" On issues like school choice and curriculum transparency, he says, ""in Florida, it's not just Republican parents that care about that. A lot of independents and some Democrats were really appreciative of some of the stands we've taken.""
… A few yards away from where we sit on wooden folding chairs, DeSantis's wife Casey comforts their son Mason, 5, who is ""having a morning"" and feeling out of sorts. Later in the day, the two girls, 6-year-old Madison and 3-year-old Mamie, will join them, and the family will spend hours traipsing through the fairgrounds—going on rides, playing games—a show of wholesome, typical family behavior that's clearly aimed at showing the softer side of an introverted candidate often derided as wooden. The campaign's hope is to humanize the policy-focused DeSantis by linking his record to his personal life.
… That record is hardly uncontroversial. Education and parental rights issues have been central to DeSantis's agenda, which has departed from traditional Republican themes and emphasized hard-right culture wars. He pushed to open schools and opposed mask mandates in the fall of 2020; signed legislation, termed ""don't say gay"" by critics, that banned the teaching of sex and gender before eighth grade, sparking an ongoing clash with Disney; barred transgender minors from accessing gender-affirming medical treatments, being called their preferred pronouns, or using their preferred bathrooms at school; crusaded against critical race theory, drafting new educational standards that have drawn criticism for their approach to slavery; mandated ""curriculum transparency"" that allows parents to challenge books used in classrooms, leading to restrictions that critics call book bans; and passed a sweeping school-choice law. All of these, in DeSantis's view, are planks in a platform that adds up to protecting children's innocence and safeguarding parents' role as the primary decision-makers in their kids' education.
… Framing it all a crusade for ""parents' rights"" is a neat trick politically, highlighting a throwback, traditionalist view of what used to be termed ""family values,"" but with a very 2023 culture-war spin. ""Kids should be kids—there shouldn't be an agenda,"" he tells me. ""I didn't feel like there was an agenda when I was growing up."" It has the potential to remind voters of DeSantis's aggressive policy record while highlighting his relative youth and vigor—an implicit contrast with the thrice-married, 77-year-old frontrunner, whose wife and eldest daughter have declined to campaign with him this time around. At the same time, skeptics point to DeSantis's slipping poll numbers and question whether all this resonates with an electorate polls show to be more concerned with kitchen-table issues.
… DeSantis sits wide-legged in jeans and a short-sleeved dark-blue fishing shirt with his name embroidered above both breast pockets, elbows planted on knees as he leans forward in his folding chair. He converses easily, albeit without deviating much from his standard talking points, and makes eye contact throughout our half-hour conversation. When I press him on whether he's actually superseding parents' rights with his own agenda, he argues that his school-choice law allows liberal parents to send their kids to private or charter schools that might take a different educational approach than he might prefer for his own children, as long as they meet basic standards.
… ""As a parent right now, I can't take my six-year-old daughter and get her a tattoo, even if I want to do that,"" he says. ""You don't have the right to do things that are going to be destructive to kids. I think that some of these parents are being told by physicians who are making a lot of money off this that you have to do this, otherwise your kid can end up doing something like commit suicide. I think that they get bullied into thinking this is the right decision."" It is, he adds, ""totally appropriate for us to say that protection of children means that those things are not appropriate.""
… ""I thought he was powerful,"" says Anne, 61, a physician from Ames who declines to give her last name but proclaims herself ""excited"" about DeSantis's candidacy. ""I like what he stands for. I like what he's done for the state of Florida."" Anne tells me she previously voted for Trump but can no longer stomach him: ""I'm kind of embarrassed by the stuff he's been doing.""
… DeSantis stops to answer questions from reporters, criticizing Trump for refusing to sign the Republican National Committee's loyalty pledge and promise to support the GOP nominee. ""It's not just about you,"" he says. ""You've got to be willing to stand up and support the team. And if someone's not willing to do that, that just shows you that they're running their campaigns more about them.""
... The governor's got a great message, but people aren't going to know about it if we don't tell them,"" [Campaign manager James Uthmeier] tells me. Over and over in Iowa and New Hampshire, Uthmeier says, he hears voters say they were planning to vote for Trump but changed their minds after hearing from DeSantis directly. ""We've got the smartest guy in the room, somebody who actually studies the policy, knows it inside and out, and has ideas to succeed in executing that policy,"" Uthmeier says. ""It's all about packaging that knowledge in a way that's clear and concise and relatable to voters."" He likens DeSantis to a savvy running back who waits for the right opening.
... DeSantis is a Harvard-educated lawyer who stresses law and order, and, at least when it comes to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the need for public officials to be held accountable. But when I ask about the indictments, he pivots to explaining why he would pardon Trump. ""When I'm President, we need a fresh start,"" he says. ""Just like Ford pardoned Nixon, we are going to move on from the Trump controversies."" He goes on to argue that ""the Department of Justice is highly political"" and launches into an extended legal analysis of the Washington-based federal case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, which he calls ""flimsy charges.""
… ""These are novel applications of the law, to conduct that has not traditionally been criminalized,"" he says. ""And I think that's why it's been viewed—at least in my judgment, and by people that think like me—very, very skeptically. Also, why all of a sudden are they doing this now? January 6 happened how many years ago, and I don't know what the agenda is behind that.""
... ""What we were able to do in Florida is a massive coalition,"" DeSantis says. ""Yes, we won Republicans big, I won Republicans by more than anyone has ever done. 97% of Republicans voted for me."" But he also, he notes, won independent voters and women voters. ""And that's what we need, because clearly what we've done nationally recently is not enough to be able to get the job done,"" he says. ""I just think that the voters are begging for an alternative to Biden that they can get behind, and I would be that vessel.""

… ""These are novel applications of the law, to conduct that has not traditionally been criminalized,"" he says. ""And I think that's why it's been viewed—at least in my judgment, and by people that think like me—very, very skeptically. Also, why all of a sudden are they doing this now? January 6 happened how many years ago, and I don't know what the agenda is behind that.""
... ""What we were able to do in Florida is a massive coalition,"" DeSantis says. ""Yes, we won Republicans big, I won Republicans by more than anyone has ever done. 97% of Republicans voted for me."" But he also, he notes, won independent voters and women voters. ""And that's what we need, because clearly what we've done nationally recently is not enough to be able to get the job done,"" he says. ""I just think that the voters are begging for an alternative to Biden that they can get behind, and I would be that vessel.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Opinion: Nikki Haley's Iowa State Fair Illustrates How She'd Put in the Work as President,2023-08-16T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-opinion-nikki-haleys-iowa-state-fair-illustrates-how-shed-put,"
Des Moines Register by Chris Cournoyer
There's a right way to do the Iowa State Fair, and there's a wrong way.
I say that from experience. In 2017, I ran for the state legislature and won. The county fairs were make-or-break moments for me — a time to really connect with Iowans and give them a chance to get to know me in an authentic way.
What was true for me is true for the many presidential candidates hoping to win the hearts — and votes — of Iowans next year. You learn a lot from the leaders who show up, look you in the eye, answer questions and show that they are listening. And while there's no official ""checklist,"" we're all essentially looking for the same thing.

Who stays the longest — and who leaves the earliest?
Who shakes the most hands — and who avoids the people of the Hawkeye State?
Who gets the most genuine face time with voters — and who plays more to the TV cameras thanthe real voters?
The list goes on. We look for who visits with farmers, the students, and local small businesses.

We listen to candidates stump on the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox.
But we don't just want to hear what they have to say. Far more important, we want to see what they do, because actions speak louder than political platitudes.
All told, this year, most presidential candidates showed up. But when it comes to the checklist I just laid out, only one candidate did the Iowa State Fair the right way.
Nikki Haley.
I hope you saw what I saw. The former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador didn't fly in and fly out. She spent Thursday, Friday and her whole Saturday on the fairgrounds, ""Fair-Side.""
Nikki connected with real people in real ways. She met cattle farmers, ate at local vendors, flipped pork, played games with Sen. Joni Ernst, and talked at length with Gov. Kim Reynolds.
No one else did all of that.
A lot of candidates skipped the Des Moines Register's famed Soapbox, too. But not Nikki. Some candidates try to fill up as much of the 20 minutes with the sound of their own voice. Not Nikki.
She opened her time on the soapbox to the audience, saying, ""But I want to talk to you now about what's going on in the country, and then I'm going to open it up to questions. There's nothing I won't answer. You may just not like my answer."" In return, she got an array of questions, from how to solve the mental health crisis to how to mend the broken economy. She followed through on her promise. She answered every question.
In fact, when one attendee tried to interrupt her, Nikki gave a master class in grit and grace. She didn't pick a fight or resort to insults. She stood her ground, made her principles clear, and showed Iowans that she stays calm under pressure.
This is what leadership looks like. This is how a president acts.
We don't need someone who ignores people, attacks the media, and does 20 rounds of tit for tat. We need someone who's honest with people, who inspires them with the truth, and who provides a vision of a better future — built on timeless American principles.
Haley does just that, and not just at the Iowa State Fair. She's unafraid to stand up, correct the record, and talk about the tough issues. She's proved it by stumping in Iowa and holding 36 grassroots events since her campaign launch in February — more than most candidates.
No wonder she crushed the Soapbox. For Nikki Haley, it was just another day in Iowa.
The real question is, why aren't others doing things the way Nikki does? We should expect every candidate to campaign the Iowa Way. If they aren't willing to host town halls, attend roundtables with local leaders, and answer questions from Iowans, what does that say about their commitment to Americans? If they ignore us now, they'll ignore us later, especially when they don't need our votes anymore.
The ""Iowa Way"" is the hard way, the long way, the time-consuming way. But it's critical to sniffing out the candidates who are in the race to save America versus those who just want to boost themselves.
Nikki Haley is running for president for the right reasons. She'll take our country in the right direction, making America strong and proud once more. And yes, she did the Iowa State Fair the right way, which says an awful lot about everything else she's going to do.
Chris Cournoyer is a state senator who represents Scott, Clinton, and Jackson counties. She has endorsed Nikki Haley for the upcoming caucuses.

Ron DeSantis today joined Laura Ingraham on the Ingraham Angle. Read the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On Donald Trump's most recent indictment:
What we need to do is get a President obviously that can beat Biden, but that can actually end the weaponization of federal power through the DOJ, the FBI. So for example, with me as president on day one, Christopher Wray gets sent packing. You're going to see the DOJ cleared out. We're going to ensure a single standard of justice in this country again, and I can say that with credibility because I've done that in the state of Florida. We drained the swamp. And here, we've gotten rid of negligent election supervisors in South Florida, we've removed two different progressive prosecutors funded by Soros who were not enforcing the law. So I've shown an ability to take action and get the job done. And as the President, I am going to do the same thing. Look, our country is in decline for a number of different reasons. Economic, cultural, but part of the reason we're in decline is because our constitutional system is totally out of whack. We need to get it back in order. I'm the guy that knows how to do [it] but you got to be disciplined, you got to be focused. You have to have the attention to detail because the swamp is not going to give up its power voluntarily.
On his successful record of getting things done:
I think when you're talking about voters in our party base, that may be a problem if you nominate some Rockefeller Republican, but it's not going to be a problem if you nominate somebody like me who has a proven record of delivering on America-first policies. How many people get elected, [and] they over-promise and they under-deliver. I can say with credibility, I met all the promises I made to the people of Florida. In fact, I over-delivered on my promises, whether it was holding China accountable, illegal immigration, education, all these things we said we'd do we got done.
On looking forward to the upcoming debates:
I think that at the end of the day, we're doing what we need to do on the ground in Iowa [and] New Hampshire. We're gonna be back there this weekend, and we're gonna get the job done. I think a lot of these guys are doing this and doing that. We're gonna be able to get on the debate stage and we're gonna be able to hash it out, and I think I'll be able to show that I'm the guy that's got the vision. I'm the guy that can get the job done electorally, and then most important, actually get all this stuff done because we've been talking about...all this stuff from illegal immigration and the border, dealing with China, all this stuff. Now is the time to do it. And if we don't do it in 2024, I don't think we're going to be able to get the job done in our lifetime. So this is a key election so we can reverse the decline of this country and give us a new birth of freedom.

""As President, I'll be the leader--but it's not going to be focusing on me--it's going to be focusing on what the American people need, so that we could get this country on the right track, and we can stop our nation's decline. And that's what I'm committed to do.""
Ron DeSantis today held a virtual press conference with New England media ahead of his trip to New Hampshire this weekend. The highlights are below.
Video of the virtual press conference will be posted on Rumble shortly.
On Donald Trump's indictment by a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia:
So, I haven't had a chance to read it all. But I will tell you, Atlanta has huge problems with crime right now. And there has been an approach to crime which has been less than exacting. I think there have been criminals that have been let out that shouldn't have been let out. And so they're now doing an inordinate amount of resources to try to shoehorn this contest over the 2020 election into a RICO statute, which was really designed to be able to go after organized crime, not necessarily to go after political activity. And so, I think it's an example of this criminalization of politics. I don't think that this is something that is good for the country, but I think a lot of Republican voters are looking at some of the things that have happened, whether it's the Department of Justice, whether it is some of the things that have happened locally, and I think the question is, okay, what are we going to do about it? And I've already said, as president, we are going to end the weaponization of federal agencies like the DOJ and FBI. We'll have a new director. We will have new leadership in the DOJ. We're going to make sure that there's a single standard of justice in this country. Now, in terms of some of these local DAs: in Florida, we've actually suspended two--one in Tampa and one in Orlando--over the last year for failure to follow their duties and responsibilities. And as President, we will lean in against some of these local prosecutors if they are not following the law or if they are abandoning their duty to enforce the law evenly. So I think that — I don't know how it's going to affect anything politically. For me, at the end of the day, it's about 'let's get this country in a good direction.' We need to have confidence in our justice system again, but before we get there, you know, we need major, major accountability.
On Donald Trump's attacks on New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu:
I disagree with Donald Trump's attacks on Governor Chris Sununu. I think New Hampshire is the best governed state in New England. I think Chris has done a great job up there and you can see with the fact that people flee to New Hampshire, just like people flee to Florida, whether it's to escape crime, high taxes, you name it. So those guys have done a good job up in New Hampshire as the Live Free or Die state. And as Republicans, we should be supporting Republican governors whether it's Kim Reynolds in Iowa or Chris Sununu in New Hampshire. When they can get elected with big victories and then deliver. So just as a fellow governor, I appreciate that very much.
On what he has learned on the ground campaigning in the Granite State:
I think there's been a couple of things. I mean, I think one, with the drug problems... it really underscored how national this problem of the border is, that you can go to a state like New Hampshire tucked away in New England, thousands of miles from the southern border, and yet you have these lives that are shattered by things like fentanyl overdose, and it really resonates in New Hampshire. So it just shows we've got to get that problem done. We've got to stop what's happening at the southern border and I'll be able to get that done. I think another thing is, and we've done a lot in Florida, but just the need to really have a good pathway for mental health in this country, particularly mental health for our veterans. You know a lot of people don't realize what a huge percentage of the population in New Hampshire are veterans. You know, people kind of know they retire to Florida, they assume some other states. But this is a really big deal in New Hampshire, and we've done some things in Florida. We're going to be rolling out a veteran's package very, very soon that's going to build up some of the things we've done in Florida, but will also incorporate what we've been hearing on the campaign trail. And I would say that's been something that I've seen in Iowa as well. I think that there's a lot of concern. If we went back 10 years ago, I don't think you would see voters as concerned about some of the issues regarding mental health. So we're going to tackle that head on, particularly when it comes to our veterans and particularly when it comes to our first responders.
On his forward-looking vision for America:
Even if you appreciate some of President Trump's accomplishments, how do we get this going forward, where we can make it about the future of the American people, rather than focusing and relitigating some of this stuff from the past? How do we get it to where the average voter knows we're focusing on your family, and your community's well-being and your kids education and safe streets? If it's on those issues, I think we're going to be in really, really good shape. So clearly, do you have a candidate like me, you know, we're not going to have to focus on some of the controversies of the past. We can focus on our vision for the future. Now, some of that, of course, does involve bringing accountability for things that may have happened in the past. Part of that is COVID accountability, part of that is ending weaponization of DOJ and FBI, of course. I mean, those are really, really important things, but I think the general thrust has got to be for our party to win, about the American people's future, and I'm just a vessel for this. As President, I'll be the leader--but it's not going to be focusing on me--it's going to be focusing on what the American people need, so that we could get this country on the right track, and we can stop our nation's decline. And that's what I'm committed to do. And we're going to take that message in small towns, in big cities wherever we need to go, we're going to do that.

Statement by Will Hurd on the Second Anniversary of the Fall of Kabul,2023-08-16T00:00:00+00:00,Will Hurd,/documents/statement-will-hurd-the-second-anniversary-the-fall-kabul,"
Today, former Texas Rep. and 2024 presidential candidate Will Hurd released the following statement to mark the second anniversary of the fall of Kabul:
""Today marks the solemn two-year anniversary of President Biden’s shameful withdrawal from Afghanistan that killed 13 American service members, exposed tens of thousands of our Afghan allies to Taliban retribution, and damaged our credibility on the global stage. The fall of Kabul into the hands of the Taliban under Biden’s leadership is an unfading stain on his presidency.
""Two years later, the horrific images of civilians clinging to planes and American troops left exposed and defenseless against our enemies remain etched into our nation’s collective memory. And yet, not a single person has been held accountable. Not a single person lost their job. The American people are owed a clear explanation of the decision-making that led to the chaos of that dark day.
""I served in Kabul as a CIA officer. I know first-hand the conditions on the ground and the implications of our withdrawal. The Taliban is stronger than ever, al Qaeda is rebuilding, and our adversaries are emboldened. Under my administration, I will hold those responsible for the disastrous withdrawal accountable, I will make clear to our foes that the U.S. is back in full force, I will assure our allies that when we fight, we fight together, and I will ensure that America will never negotiate with terrorists again.""

Today, Iowa kingmaker Steve Deace penned an op-ed in the Washington Times about his decision to endorse Ron DeSantis for president. Read the full article below.
Why I'm endorsing Ron DeSantis for president
Washington Times
Steve Deace
August 15, 2023
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has done more damage to the leftists intent on destroying America than any politician I've seen in my lifetime. He threw out the Republicans' losing playbook, took no prisoners, and showed conservatives what it looks like to go on the offensive and win. When he made promises, he delivered — and then some.
To put it bluntly, it's not enough to message and market ""Make America Great Again."" We need a ruthless, consistent leader to get it done.
His proven leadership aside, here are the three reasons why I decided to finally endorse Mr. DeSantis for president.
First, while I host a national show on BlazeTV, I live in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state. I'm heavily involved in the process here, and I've always believed that the audience deserves honesty whenever those who are blessed to do what I do for a living can provide it.
My overall analysis was already favorable to Mr. DeSantis before the endorsement, but now you know where I stand and can filter my commentary through that lens on your own.
Second, there won't be an option to vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
He has real electability issues, but even more fundamental than that, I don't believe you'll be able to vote for him even if you want to. He will either be in prison by this time next year or forced to take a plea deal to stay out of it. The D.C. gulag wants to imprison him by hook or by crook — maybe even by Super Tuesday.
Every day we refuse to recognize this inevitable outcome is a wasted day. Since Republicans in Congress won't defund the Department of Justice (which Mr. Trump bizarrely hasn't asked for), the only way to stop the persecution of Mr. Trump is to win the election with a candidate who will break the system and clean house.
If Mr. Trump isn't on the ballot, who else has an actual record of draining swamps other than Mr. DeSantis? Nobody.
The same Vivek Ramaswamy currently auditioning to be bishop of MAGA just wrote a book — last year — condemning Mr. Trump and praising former Vice President Mike Pence, for goodness' sake.
Sen. Tim Scott is out there saying ""build the wall"" after years of saying ""cops are racists"" and ""empty the prisons.""
Opportunists abound, but one stands out as a proven ally. Only one other candidate truly threatens the system and arguably presents a greater threat than Mr. Trump: Ron DeSantis.
The DeSantis campaign has built the most impressive advance organization in my state that I've ever seen, and we're going to need him sooner than we realize.
Third, I fear the window to peaceably but meaningfully stop America's decline through the political process is closing. The only way to revive America's future is by securing policy victories.
We have already discredited the left's media. We have already discredited their institutions. We have already discredited their system.
Mr. Trump played an admirable and vital role in that, for which I am grateful, no doubt.
The problem? After the three years of hell this country went through, not a single meaningful incumbent lost power. There were only two places where the Democratic Party was rightfully destroyed: Florida and Iowa, two places with governors who didn't surrender their people to generational damage at the hands of Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx and Mr. Trump.
On the right, we have forgotten that we will either meet the enemy in the arena of public policy or in the arena of war. That is the lesson of history. If we don't win on policy outcomes now, we will sentence our children and grandchildren to have to win on the battlefield later.
Those are the only two options. We can't win on policy without governing. To govern, we need the buy-in of our fellow citizens.
No one on the right this century has been a stronger leader than Ron DeSantis. Last November, his one-state crushing red wave proved he can win a general election.
Let me close with this. There is no incentive for me to do this. I've probably cost myself millions of dollars as both an author and movie producer this year by not shilling for Mr. Trump.
I'm endorsing Ron DeSantis for no other reason than I think it is the right and necessary thing to do for us, our children and our grandchildren.

DES MOINES, Iowa — The Asa for America campaign released the following statement this evening in regard to the fourth indictment of Donald Trump. This statement can be attributed to Governor Asa Hutchinson:
""This is another day of challenge for our democracy with the indictment handed down by the grand jury in Georgia. As a former federal prosecutor, I have personally pursued racketeering charges in federal court against terrorist organizations, and I understand the difficulty of a multi-defendant indictment and how slow the case will proceed in state court. Regardless of the specifics of the Georgia indictment, I expect the voters will make the ultimate decision on the future of our democracy. Over a year ago, I said that Donald Trump's actions disqualified him from ever serving as President again. Those words are more true today than ever before. I will have additional comments after I review the details of the indictment,"" — Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the 46th Governor of Arkansas and a current Republican candidate for President

""Biden's made a decision to go with the Green New Deal and pursue that agenda. That is not an agenda that is going to help us reduce inflation.""
Ron DeSantis sat down with Brian Sullivan from CNBC's Last Call. Read the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On his opposition to tax increases:
""We don't want to see increases in taxes. We definitely want to see things like permanent bonus depreciation, making sure you have full expensing, I think that that's a really smart thing to do. That's kind of been eroded over the last few years. But we should do that. But here's the thing, we are taking in as high a percentage of our GDP in taxes, as we have in any time since World War Two, even when we had higher tax rates in like the 40s or 50s. And so I don't know how much more meat there is on the bone in terms of taxes.""
On bringing down the national debt:
""I've been saying that our country is in a state of decline now, cultural, military, but also economic. And I think this debt figure is a great example of that. I mean, we've added like 12 trillion to the debt in like the last five or six years... This idea, that is all the Democrats--I tell Republican audiences, both parties have done it, both parties have been involved. And actually, Republicans are very tough when they're out of power. But when they get in power, you know, they basically go on a spending binge, too. And I think you've seen it over the last five or six years. 100%, it's a bipartisan thing. But how do we end up with $32 trillion in debt?
A lot of it was how they handled the response to COVID. I mean, they did trillions and trillions of dollars, very little to show for it. The response was poor. But what the Congress has done, they basically locked in that level of spending. Once government increases spending, that kind of becomes the new baseline. You can't govern like that. In Florida, we basically do zero-based budgeting. So you could head an agency in Florida, maybe you got a billion dollars last year, you're not entitled to get more than a billion next year. You have to justify what you're going to do. We don't do that in Washington. So debt does matter. The interest is gobbling up more and more percentage. I mean I think the percentage of GDP that's dedicated to interest payments has doubled in the last five or six years. That is not healthy. Clearly, we've got to get inflation under control. Part of that is Congress should stop spending so much money. Part of that is grow the economy. Part of it is increased productivity. But part of it is energy independence and unleashing our domestic energy production. Biden's made a decision to go with the Green New Deal and pursue that agenda. That is not an agenda that is going to help us reduce inflation. It is not an agenda that's going to be good for the average American family. That's not an agenda that's going to be good for maximum economic growth. We have an opportunity to have a huge competitive advantage with our energy resources here in the United States. But when you say don't do that, focus more on EV, that's emboldening Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and China. So geopolitically, it makes a lot of sense for us to be energy independent.""
On the dangers of ESG:
""We have a lot of migration into Florida. These people tell me why they do. You can talk to realtors, yes, freedom from COVID, yes, low taxes, a lot of that. But they will say public safety is one of the top reasons why they're moving from San Francisco or Chicago, or New York City to Florida because they haven't taken it seriously. So you've got to get that right. But here's the thing, it's connected to ESG and some of this other stuff, because it's ideology. They're putting ideology ahead of tried-and-true principles. New York figured out how to keep the streets safe. If you look under Giuliani and Bloomberg, it was the safest big city in the world, probably because they took the policing seriously, they'd hold criminals accountable. A lot of these liberal jurisdictions have turned their back on it. But I would say it's the same thing that motivates ESG, its ideology that's motivated ESG.""
On if he would re-nominate Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve Chair:
GOV. DESANTIS: ""No.""
BRIAN SULLIVAN: ""Why not?""
GOV. DESANTIS: ""I don't think he's done a good job. I mean, I think from COVID on, they put too much money into the economy, that drove the inflation but then they said it was going to be transitory, that we had to unlearn Milton Friedman, no. When you start doing something like that, it's about 18 to 20 months you are going to see inflation so they were behind the ball on that and then they pipe so much now it's caused a lot of problems in the economy and could end up driving us into a recession.""

On the importance of reversing American decline:
I understand the stakes of this election. We're a country in decline. It's not inevitable. It's a choice. It's a choice we as Americans are going to make over the next 18 months. I'm running for president because simply managing the decline of our country a little bit better than the Democrats isn't going to cut it. We must reverse the decline of this country and I am somebody who I mentioned is a blue collar kid. I worked minimum wage jobs to be able to get through school and to give myself an opportunity because I always believed in America, [you] get the most out of your God given ability and America gives you a chance to succeed. And yet that American dream is slipping away for millions and millions of people throughout this country, the most powerful country in the history of this earth. And yet our country today is weaker than it's ever been in our lifetime. We need to restore American strength. We need to revive American civic pride. As a father of three, I understand the importance giving our kids opportunities and we've discussed many of those here today. We need to leave this country better off than we found it. And we are in danger of being the first generation that turns over less opportunities to our kids than the opportunities we've inherited. And that is unacceptable. As governor, I showed how all this can be done. We led with purpose and conviction. We did not use polls, we did not put our finger in the wind. We set out a vision, we executed that vision and we fought for people. We fought for their freedom. We fought for their education. We fought for their rights and Florida now has never done better as a result of our leadership, not just in terms of the results, but also in terms of the political success that we've had. We need to do that nationally. We need to win the election. The time for excuses for Republicans is over. We must get the job done in 2024. I will get the job done and we will take office in January of 2025. And you can talk to people that know me. When I tell you I'm going to do something, I'm not just doing that to put something out for fodder in a campaign. If I tell you I'm going to do something, you can take it to the bank. We are going to follow through and we are going to deliver on our promises. And so I will get the job done as president and we will give this country a new birth of freedom that it deserves.
On protecting parental rights in education:
Well what it goes back to is, you have the left that wants to use the school system for indoctrination of the kids, rather than education. And they know if the parents are involved, that creates a roadblock for them to be able to indoctrinate. And so they would rather have the parents butt out. A teacher would want the parents involved because if a parent is involved in their kid's academic progress, they're going to do much better. If a parent's not involved, it's harder to get the student to perform up to potential. So it's all about they want to reduce the role of parents so that they can impose their agenda. That's why Biden says things like 'they're not your kids they're all of our kids.' No, they're not your kids, Joe, I'm sorry. And it also took you four and a half years to even acknowledge your own granddaughter in Arkansas. I'm sorry. That's just the truth.
On his plan to put an end to Bidenomics:
We've got to hold Congress accountable. We can't let them spend us into oblivion anymore. And we need things like a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and term limits for members of Congress. We're also going to help middle class families and jobs by utilizing all of our domestic energy resources and being energy independent in this country. And we have a great competitive advantage in that we're not going to force people to buy electric vehicles. First of all, that's expensive, a lot of people don't want [it], it's not good for liquid fuels, like in Iowa with the biofuels. We're not going to do the electric forcing. That that benefits China. China produces a lot into that. We're going to use our resources here. that's going to be good for jobs, lower prices, it's going to be good for our industrial base, and it is going to be good for our national security.
On slaying the federal bureaucracy:
The agencies in Washington have increased by 50% since 2019. 50%. Do you feel 50% better as Americans, the fact that that government has grown that much? I don't think so. We need to pare government back to where it was many, many years ago. We're going to reduce the number of bureaucrats in Washington by at least 50%. We're going to make sure that agencies that abuse their power, like the FBI or the DOJ, that when they do that, they get fired for abusing their power. So buckle up, we're gonna do a lot and I think the swamp is not gonna like it. But you know what? I've had enough of the swamp imposing its will on us. Now it's the time we the people impose our will on it.
On military readiness:
If you look at our military now, we have the lowest recruiting that we've had since the draft ended after the Vietnam War. And why is that? Well, part of the reason is because the military is indulging in social experimentation [and] woke ideology politicization. You have talked about drag queens and pronouns and all this stuff. China is laughing at us when they see this. This is not the way you do [it]. So we're going to get rid of all of that on day one as commander in chief, and we're going to restore the military mission first.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - The DeSantis Family Does the Iowa State Fair: DeSantis Makes Surprise Appearance at Knoxville Nationals Sprint Car Race with Kim Reynolds,2023-08-13T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-the-desantis-family-does-the-iowa-state-fair-desantis,"
Governor DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis today visited the Iowa State Fair, with their three children along for the fun. From serving burgers to Iowans to his live radio hit with WHO's Simon Conway, Governor DeSantis' state fair visit wrapped up a lively three-day, eight-county swing through the Hawkeye State.
Governor DeSantis started the morning with Governor Kim Reynold's Fair-Side Chat, where they spoke about the conservative policies he delivered for Floridians and his plan to do for America what he did in Florida.
""I just believe in service over self,"" said Governor DeSantis. ""I believe if you have an opportunity to do good things for your community or your country, that you have a responsibility to do that and to get that done. And so that's really influenced me all the way up to the present in terms of what I'm looking to do with running for President.""
Watch the full Fair-Side Chat HERE.
After the Fair-Side Chat, Governor DeSantis answered questions from the media and was asked by Fox News' Paul Steinhauser about Donald Trump's attacks on Kim Reynolds. Governor DeSantis said in response,
""I think that Donald Trump's attacks on Kim Reynolds are totally out of bounds. I couldn't disagree with it any more. And she's done really nothing but do a great job. She's never done anything to him. But that's just how he operates, to attack one of the best governors in the country. And Iowa has had a tremendous run of success here. The legislators had a lot to do with it, but clearly Kim really lead the way in ways that have been exemplary. So, I'm a big fan. I think as Republicans, we should be thankful and proud to see other Republicans doing well, particularly in a state like Iowa, which has not always been considered a red state. Just 10 years ago it was more of a swing state. She has had a lot to do with changing that. So I think I disagree with the attacks against her. I think he's way out of bounds. And at the end of the day, I'm glad that Kim Reynolds is at the helm here in the state of Iowa.""
Governor DeSantis then went to the Pork Producers Tent with Senator Joni Ernst and Representative Zach Nunn, where he grilled pork chops and served burgers to Iowan fair-goers.
Another highlight of the day was the family fun. Governor DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis, along with Madison, Mason, and Mamie, rode the bumper cars and the Ferris wheel, played carnival games, and ate snow cones and ice cream.
While seeing the fair sights, Governor DeSantis did a walk-and-talk with Fox News' Alexis McAdams, and highlighted the importance of the upcoming debates.
""People should debate. That's something that you owe it to the people to do,"" said Governor DeSantis.
Governor DeSantis also stopped by WHO's tent for a live radio interview with Simon Conway, where they talked about his aim to visit all 99 counties in Iowa and his military service.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
Governor DeSantis on visiting all 99 counties in Iowa:
""On Thursday and Friday, we did more bus touring, so we hit another six counties yesterday. We're up to 38 of the 99 that we visited so far... people appreciate it. I think that in politics and campaigns, you obviously go where there's a lot of population, of course, you have to do that, [but] when you show up to some of the more rural counties, they appreciate that you showed up, listened to them, took their questions and told them your vision. So we've had a really good response, and we're going to hit all 99, probably by the end of October I think we'll finish it.""
Governor DeSantis on putting service over self:
""The reality is in a presidential campaign, people want to know about you. Why you? What's motivating you to want to be the next president of the United States? And so I have started to talk more about my decision to volunteer for the military after 9/11. I had opportunities because of hard work to put myself in position where I could have had some lucrative opportunities in the private sector, but I felt a responsibility to serve so we volunteered to serve, volunteered even to serve in Iraq alongside Navy Seals in Fallujah and Ramadi. And I think what that shows people, particularly Iowans, who I think really appreciate service, it says, 'Hey, this is a guy that's put service above self.' And I've done that throughout my career. And so they can have confidence that I'm running for president not because I want to be somebody, I'm running for President because I want to do big things on behalf of the country.""
The DeSantis family ended the day with a surprise visit to the Knoxville Nationals Sprint Car Race with Governor Kim Reynolds.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - In the News: Des Moines Register: Ron DeSantis to bring Iowa endorsers to state fair in apparent dig at Donald Trump,2023-08-12T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-the-news-des-moines-register-ron-desantis-bring-iowa,"
""You know, people from Washington, that's not my cup of tea.""
While Donald Trump's Iowa struggles are forcing him import support from Washington to the Iowa State Fair this weekend, the Des Moines Register reported this afternoon Governor Ron DeSantis will be joined at the event by 11 Iowa state legislators who have endorsed his candidacy. DeSantis' strong display of support from Iowans as he participates in Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds' Fair-Side Chat Saturday will come a day after he received the backing of 120 county-level chairs across the state and after Iowa kingmaker Steve Deace endorsed the governor Friday.

Ron DeSantis to bring Iowa endorsers to state fair in apparent dig at Donald Trump
Des Moines Register
Brianne Pfannenstiel and Katie Akin
August 11, 2023
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will bring a gaggle of Iowa legislators with him to the Iowa State Fair Saturday — an apparent response to former President Donald Trump, who announced Wednesday he plans to travel with his own coterie of endorsers from Florida.
DeSantis will attend the fair with Iowa state Reps. Jon Dunwell, Dan Gehlbach, Bill Gustoff, Joshua Meggers, Henry Stone, Hans C. Wilz and Devon Wood, as well as state Sens. Adrian Dickey, Jesse Green, Amy Sinclair and Tom Shipley.
The announcement comes after Trump's campaign told the Des Moines Register the former president would attend the state fair with nine Florida Republican members of Congress who have endorsed him over DeSantis, a fellow Floridian.
Asked about Trump's plan while campaigning in Iowa Friday, DeSantis said he's proud to have ""so many Iowa leaders supporting us.""
""You know, people from Washington, that's not my cup of tea. I was there for three terms, I didn't drink the Kool-Aid. I've recovered from the experience,"" he told reporters outside of the American Legion in Harlan.
Iowa hosts the first presidential nominating contest of the Republican primary cycle, and in-state endorsers are highly coveted.
Conservative Iowa commentator Steve Deace formally endorsed DeSantis on Friday. And a slate of sheriffs and sheriff deputies previously endorsed his campaign.
""Our voters, I think across the country, they're not looking to Washington for leadership,"" DeSantis said. ""They understand D.C. is failing. So I think what they want to see is people in their communities, how are those folks looking? And I think it's been very clear, whether it's sheriffs, whether it's members of the Iowa House, Iowa Senate, when they have to make a judgment about who the best nominee will be for the Republican Party, they're overwhelmingly choosing me.""
DeSantis is scheduled to attend the Iowa State Fair Saturday, joining Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds at her ""fair-side chat"" Q&A series with candidates. And Reynolds, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn will join DeSantis to flip pork at the Pork Producers tent, his campaign said.
Trump is also set to attend the fair Saturday, though he hasn't released details of his plans.
DeSantis praised the Iowa legislators who have endorsed him, as well as Reynolds, who Trump recently criticized for or choosing to remain neutral in the 2024 Iowa caucuses rather than endorsing his candidacy.
""These are people who have delivered huge conservative victories for Iowa,"" he said. ""When I came up here the first time with Gov. Reynolds before I was a candidate, people were saying, 'Iowa, man, they're doing a lot of good stuff. They're the Florida of the north.' And then I started looking at what they were doing, and I was like, 'Man, they're doing a lot. Maybe Florida is the Iowa of the south.'""
DeSantis said he's eager to bring his three children — aged 3, 5 and 6 years old — to the fairgrounds.
""We've taken our kids to Florida State Fair, a lot of stuff that we've had in Florida, and it's fun,"" he said. ""But I think (Iowa) is kind of the granddaddy of them all.""

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Reacts To The Special Counsel In Hunter Biden Case,2023-08-12T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-reacts-the-special-counsel-hunter-biden-case,"
""We are losing confidence in the institutions of power in this country because there are two standards, one for the elite and one for the rest of us"" – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC –  This morning, Tim Scott joined FOX News' Cavuto Live to discuss Merrick Garland's appointment of a special counsel to the Hunter Biden probe.
Watch the full interview here
Tim ScottCavuto LiveAugust 12, 2023
Charles Payne: Let's get reaction to Attorney General Garland's appointment of special counsel to the Hunter Biden probe from GOP 2024 candidate Tim Scott. Senator Scott, thanks so much. So I read your post on Twitter where you say ""he can't be trusted and this decision raises further questions about the independence of Biden's DOJ.""
Sen Scott: Well, Charles, what we know for sure is that David Weiss cannot be trusted. Kid Gloves is the treatment that Hunter Biden has received from this Department of Justice. Appointing David as the special counsel is like keeping the concept of the DOJ protecting Democrats while hunting Republicans. I can't think of a more forceful sign that nothing has changed and that's bad for America. It's bad for justice and frankly, it's bad for everyday Americans who ask the question, ""can I trust the DOJ?"" The answer is emphatically no. We have to fire Joe Biden so that I, as the next president, will fire Merrick Garland and restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice.
Charles Payne: You know, it's as if well, we know for a fact that the pendulum in public opinion has swung. Right? Not long ago a lot of folks in the mainstream media blew us off. You know? Right wing conspiracy. Now they are admitting something is there, right? There's smoke there, there's fire there. And maybe this was done to head off the fact that the House has been so successful in changing the narrative. The question for you though swirling around is, is there enough out there now for a probe, not an impeachment of President Biden, but for at least an official probe into his role in this?
Sen Scott: The answer is yes. The cookie crumbs lead right back to the Biden family, not just to Hunter Biden. We need to gather all the facts, all the information so that justice can be served before the American people. The one thing I have confidence in is Kevin McCarthy and the House's ability to do their job and to bring all that information that's been hidden since as early as 2019 to light. That's what the American people want to see is the truth. We are losing confidence in the institutions of power in this country because there are two standards, one for the elite and one for the rest of us. That won't hold. We cannot allow that to happen. Thank God for a House Majority in the hands of the Republican party that are looking forward to presenting the truth. Not a biased approach, but just as simple facts so the American people can make their own decision and come to the same conclusions that the rest of everyday Americans are coming to. Your justice system cannot last.

Mike Pence issued the following statement at the Iowa State Fair on the Hunter Biden special counsel:
""To be honest, I can't relate to what Joe Biden's son was doing when he was Vice President. When I was Vice President, my son was flying an F-35 for the Marine Corp defending this country. I think it's about time that we saw the appointment of a special counsel to get to the bottom of not only what Hunter Biden was doing, but what the Biden family was doing. The American people deserve answers and I welcome the appointment.""

""I'm endorsing Ron DeSantis for President because I think he's the strongest leader in the race""
Influential radio host and Iowa kingmaker Steve Deace announced his endorsement of Ron DeSantis for president today on the Steve Deace Show. Deace cited DeSantis' leadership and track record of results – such as keeping Florida free through COVID, standing up to DC bureaucrats, and turning Florida into a solid red state – as his top reasons for endorsing DeSantis for president.
""I'm endorsing Ron DeSantis for President because I think he's the strongest leader in the race. I think that's proven. I've just seen a level of leadership, strength, that I've just not seen in this era, not just among the candidates that are running right now,"" Deace said on the show today.
Deace continued by saying: ""I've seen a lot of good people come and go but frankly I have never seen it, when it comes to the issues that are going to decide the future for our children and grandchildren, who has more knowledge, more willingness, more resume, in understanding them, what to do about them, and then actually doing it. I've never seen anything like what Ron DeSantis has done in Florida.""
Watch the clip HERE.
Deace is an important voice in Iowa who has a track record of picking winners in the Hawkeye State. Deace endorsed Iowa caucus winners Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Ted Cruz in 2016. In 2015, Bloomberg Politics called Deace one of the ""most influential Republicans you've never heard of.""
The endorsement comes as DeSantis is set to visit his 38th county in Iowa today and as Never Back Down announced today that it has established county-level chairs in each of Iowa's 99 counties who support DeSantis.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Signs RNC Pledge to Support Eventual GOP Nominee But Makes One Small Edit,2023-08-11T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-signs-rnc-pledge-support-eventual-gop-nominee-but,"
Fox News by Kyle Morris
FIRST ON FOX: GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley has vowed support for the party's eventual nominee after she signed a ""Beat Biden"" pledge required by the Republican National Committee (RNC) to participate in party-sanctioned debates.
With her signing of the document, which was shared exclusively with Fox News Digital on Thursday, Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, is the third candidate to officially qualify for the first Republican presidential primary debate slated to be held later this month in Milwaukee. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the pledge earlier this week.
""I, Nikki R. Haley, affirm that I agree to appear in only Primary and General Election debates that have been sanctioned by the Republican National Committee, pursuant to Rule 10(a)(11) of The Rules of the Republican Party. I acknowledge and accept that if I fail to sign this pledge or if I participate in any debate that has not been sanctioned by the Republican National Committee, I will not be eligible to participate in any further Republican National Committee sanctioned debates,"" the document stated.
""Additionally, I affirm that if I do not win the 2024 Republican nomination for President of the United States, I will honor the will of the primary voters and support the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in order to save our country and beat Joe Biden,"" the pledge adds. ""I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.""
Hammering down on a point she has made in the past, Haley crossed out President Biden's name in the pledge and wrote, ""President Harris,"" signaling that she believes this race is not against Biden in the long run and instead against Vice President Kamala Harris.
""I have said, and I say it to every Republican candidate who's going to get on that debate stage, I will support the Republican that comes out of that. Certainly I want it to be me, but I'm gonna support the Republican because I don't believe that America can afford President Kamala Harris and we need to remember that,"" Haley said during a Fox News Channel appearance last month.
In June, Haley made similar comments, insisting that a vote for Biden is a vote for ""President Harris.""
RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel made the ""Beat Biden pledge"" a requirement for her party's candidates to be able to participate in its official debates, a rule that flies in the face of former President Donald Trump's previous suggestion he might not support the eventual winner of the Republican nomination.
According to the pledge, candidates must affirm they will only appear in debates sanctioned by the RNC, and, should they fail to sign the pledge or participate in a non-RNC sanctioned debate, they will not be able to participate in any further party-sanctioned debates.
In addition to the pledge, candidates must also reach 1% in three national polls, or 1% in two national polls and two state-specific polls from the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada in order to qualify for the debate. The polls must also be recognized by the RNC and must be conducted on or after July 1.
Additionally, to reach the debate stage, candidates must have 40,000 unique donors to their campaign committee (or exploratory committee), with ""at least 200 unique donors per state or territory in 20+ states and/or territories,"" according to the RNC criteria.

Mike Pence today issued the following statement on the historical ransom payment made to the Mullahs in Iran in exchange for American hostages:

Iran will now use this money to produce drones for Russia and fund terrorism against us and Israel. China and Russia, who are also holding Americans hostages, now know the price has just gone up. Any rogue nation that takes innocent Americans hostage during my Administration will be met with American strength; they are forewarned that we will not pay ransoms.""

""You have to earn this nomination and you have to show up.""
DES MOINES, Iowa – Governor DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis tonight joined the co-hosts of the Ruthless Podcast onstage for a live interview. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On the importance of showing up to the debate:
You have to earn this nomination and you have to show up. You have to debate. You've got to be willing to answer questions. You've got to be willing to defend your record and you've got to articulate a vision for the future. I'm proud of what we've done in Florida. If you look at when I came in to where we are now, you know we're leading the way on so many different things and by the way, we used to say Florida was a swing state. Now people just assume it's a deep red state. That wasn't the case before I was there. You also have to say, 'Why are you running?' And I can tell you I'm running because this country is in decline. Simply managing decline isn't going to be acceptable. We have to reverse that decline. But doing that is not about me. It's about you, and it's about the American people. It's that agenda that matters. And I may be a vessel for that, I'm a leader, but ultimately, I'm running to do something. I'm not running to be somebody or because it's about me.
On his Day one actions as president:
We're going to have all the executive orders written before the first day. We're going to have all the legislation, we're going to have worked with the incoming Congress about what we want to do in the House, Senate with budgetary, all that stuff. We're going to have thousands of political appointees ready to go to to be able to send for confirmation. So we're not going to sit there and waste any time. You only get certain amount of time to strike while the iron is hot in our system. Those first 100, 150 days, every second of that is precious. So we will be ready on January 20, 2025 at high noon. Soon as we take that oath of office [and] give the speech, we're getting to work. We're going to take all of Biden's executive orders and regulations and throw him in the trash can on day one. We're going to declare the southern border a national emergency. We're going to mobilize the military, and I'm gonna handle these drug cartels if they're bringing product in. We're using deadly force against the drug cartels to hold them accountable, [and] take the initial actions such as replacing the director of the FBI.
On visiting all 99 counties in Iowa and campaigning with a young family:
We have our three kids, we have six, five and three, and we said we are going do all 99 counties in Iowa. That's something that's important. We're going to do it. They've campaigned with us, but they've never really done this whole bus deal. So we started taking them on the bus. We had all these places. So we've now done 32 [counties] of the 99. Tomorrow we're going to do another six counties, and we are probably going have all 99 by the end of October, and our kids get to experience this. We were in northeastern Iowa, we go to this Creamery, they have ice cream, cheese curds, all this stuff and our kids are just having a blast with it. We went to a state fair in Clayton County. Look, I'm a baseball guy all through my life through college. So I may have shown my kids a baseball movie about Iowa before we started coming up here. So we're out there and we have like 15 minutes to burn [before] we get back on the bus. There's just a field right next to all the corn, my son is five and he likes [baseball]. So we're playing catch right by the corn and he goes to me. 'Daddy is this heaven?' I said no son, it's Iowa.
First Lady Casey DeSantis on Casey's Breakfast Pizza:
I hadn't been to a Casey's. And no wonder why it's so good. You can see the similarities. But I had never had breakfast pizza, and they said you've got to try the breakfast pizza. I had one piece, [and] I ended up eating the entire pizza in the course of a morning. Then the other thing we really love is Pizza Ranch. The best fried chicken is at Pizza Ranch, the best pizza is at a gas station. You all have some good food.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Calls to End Taxpayer Aid to Taliban-Controlled Afghanistan,2023-08-10T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-calls-end-taxpayer-aid-taliban-controlled,"
The Washington Free Beacon by Adam Kredo
The Biden administration's $2.35 billion investment in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan is emerging as a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential race, with Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley vowing to cut all U.S. aid to the country.
""When I'm president, we won't send one penny to terrorists and countries that hate America,"" former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley told the Washington Free Beacon on Wednesday. ""Nearly two years after Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, he continues to add insult to injury by throwing taxpayer dollars at the Taliban-controlled country. This is a terrorist regime that killed our troops and tortures its own people.""
Afghanistan—and the Biden administration's deadly 2021 evacuation from the country that left 13 Americans dead—has become a major talking point among the GOP's 2024 field of candidates as they seek to brandish their foreign policy credentials. Former vice president Mike Pence has repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for removing all U.S. forces from the country, and his former boss, Donald Trump, also blamed the current president for the Taliban's rise to power. Florida governor Ron DeSantis had made similar comments about the bungled U.S. withdrawal, though he hasn't focused heavily on foreign policy up to this point.
Haley's comments are some of the clearest to date from a Republican candidate about what U.S. policy towards Afghanistan would look like moving forward. The Biden administration has pumped taxpayer cash into the country since the Taliban retook power, and the United States remains the war-torn country's top patron, the Free Beacon reported on Tuesday. This cash is believed to be propping up the Taliban's government.
Haley has also come out in favor of cutting foreign aid to a range of countries she says ""hate America."" These include Iraq, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Belarus, and Cuba.
Haley, who led efforts during her time at the United Nations to cut ties with a range of organizations known for their anti-Israel bias, also has proposed cutting U.S. donations to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, a humanitarian group that works primarily in the Palestinian territories and is known to employ terrorist sympathizers.
While domestic issues and the country's ailing economy rank as the top issues for voters, foreign policy could play a role in the 2024 contest due to the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the U.S. government's aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia.
Afghanistan continues to drive down President Joe Biden's poll numbers, which took a dive following the 2021 withdrawal and continue to suffer as a result, according to NPR polling.
The issue could remain a talking point for Republican candidates as the Republican-controlled House conducts investigations into the Afghanistan debacle that have already shown the Biden administration ignored early warnings about a brewing catastrophe and made many missteps throughout the evacuations.
""There was very little intelligence to suggest the Biden administration's plan would work and a mountain range of evidence to suggest the plan would fail,"" retired Col. Seth Krummrich, former chief of staff for special operations at U.S. Central Command, told lawmakers during a hearing late last month.
Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member during the Trump administration, said that Afghanistan is certain to rank as a top foreign policy priority as the 2024 election continues to heat up.
""The withdrawal from Afghanistan is really at the core of so many issues that will be at the center of public debate for the next 15 months,"" said Goldberg, who currently serves as a senior adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. ""The perception of U.S. weakness and decline, the greenlight for Russia to invade Ukraine, increased threats from the Chinese Communist Party, a radical Islamic regime in Tehran on the doorstep of nuclear threshold status, and, of course, the rising terrorism threat we now face from inside Afghanistan itself.""

Scott Campaign Press Release - DAILY CALLER: Tim Scott Releases Campaign Ad Pledging To 'Unleash' Military On 'Terrorist' Cartels,2023-08-10T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-daily-caller-tim-scott-releases-campaign-ad-pledging-unleash,"
Republican presidential hopeful Tim Scott released a campaign ad Thursday vowing to ""unleash"" the U.S. military to combat the cartels taking advantage of the southern border, according to the ad that was first reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation.
In the ad, Scott, who serves as a senator representing South Carolina, called out the Biden administration for allowing the Mexican drug cartels to operate with impunity as tens of thousands of Americans die each year from fentanyl. Scott visited the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time as a presidential candidate in Yuma, Arizona, Aug. 4, when he pledged to finish construction of the wall if he's elected.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Campaign Releases New Veteran Themed Ad Highlighting Ron DeSantis' Service to the Nation,2023-08-09T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-campaign-releases-new-veteran-themed-ad,"
""Ron DeSantis embodies service over self""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The DeSantis campaign today released a new ad highlighting Ron DeSantis' service to the nation. DeSantis would be the first veteran to serve in a war to be elected president since 1988.
The ad comes on the heels of the detailed plan DeSantis released last month to restore America's military and make it mission-focused once again. DeSantis volunteered to join the Navy after graduating from Harvard Law School where he deployed in support of SEAL Team One as a JAG officer in Iraq and was awarded the Bronze Star.
Watch the video here.
Transcript:
When our country was under attack,Ron DeSantis fought back.He joined the Navy,Became a JAG Officer,Volunteered to serve in Iraq,Deployed with Navy Seal Team 1, and earned a bronze star.Ron DeSantis embodies service over self.And the father of three young children - he understands the importance of the fights ahead.... And why we must never back down.Ron DeSantis. The fighter we need as President.
Background:
DeSantis unveiled his ""Mission First"" Military policy in South Carolina in July.
DeSantis said then:""There was no greater honor than knowing I was wearing the cloth of my country when I served in the military, but our nation's once-proud fighting force has been infected and paralyzed by a political agenda. It is time to rip the woke out of the military and return it to its core mission. We must restore a sense of confidence, conviction, and patriotic duty to our institutions — and that begins with our military.""
Read the plan here.
In his book, ""The Courage to Be Free,"" DeSantis details how he volunteered to go to Iraq:""With no military draft, there was a strong demand for officers who could fill positions throughout the Iraq theater of operations. As the operational tempo was largely driven by the Army and the Marines, someone in my position as a naval officer would probably not have been involuntarily mobilized for forward deployment, but I wanted to serve, so I volunteers to fill a spot and deploy to Iraq.""
He goes on to discuss his role more in depth:""To me, it is unacceptable to send someone wearing our nation's uniform to a combat zone with one hand tied behind his back. War is hell, and it puts the lives of our military personnel at risk if operations get mired in bureaucracy and red tape.""
And lessons he learned from his time in Iraq:""One thing that stuck with me with the burden of the post-9/11 operations feeling on such a small segment of our population. With an all-volunteer force, it was not uncommon to see soldiers and Marines on their third and fourth deployment. This had an enormous impact on these service members: it frequently led to family breakups, posttraumatic stress, and many other negative effects.""
Ron DeSantis was a member of the United States Navy. Use of his military rank, job titles and photographs in uniform does not imply endorsement by the Department of the Navy or the Department of Defense.

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott On Biden's Dereliction Of Duty At Southern Border,2023-08-09T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-bidens-dereliction-duty-southern-border,"
""President Biden has failed this nation, especially in declaring the actual emergency, which is an emergency at our border"" – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC –  This morning, Tim Scott joined FOX & Friends to react to Biden declaring climate change a national emergency, to discuss his recent visit to the border and the upcoming GOP debate.
Watch the full interview here.
Tim ScottFOX & FriendsAugust 9, 2023
Brian Kilmeade: Presidential candidate Senator Tim Scott is here to react. Senator, first off, the president goes to the Grand Canyon, but doesn't do what you did and go to the border. Why do you think that is?
Sen Scott: Well, it's unbelievable. It's just a dereliction of duty. Let's be clear about it. President Biden has failed this nation, especially in declaring the actual emergency, which is an emergency at our border. Fentanyl has killed 70,000 Americans. He should reinstate Title 42 for a health emergency called fentanyl. It's killing Americans. We have an unsecure, wide open, and unsafe border that could be closed with a southern border wall. He refuses to complete the wall, and he also refuses to use the available technology like seismic monitors so that the CBP can do their jobs better. This is ridiculous to talk about a climate emergency when we have a border emergency that is an existential threat right now.
Brian Kilmeade: So, I mean, if we're to believe what the stats say, we are in record level heat across the current country, and in some cases around the world, do you believe that we're in the middle of climate change and you believe it's because of the use of fossil fuels?
Sen Scott: We said that the climate is obviously changing, but what we should realize, Brian, is that the country that's cut its carbon footprint in half in the last 25 years is America. The best thing to do for the climate is to keep our jobs at home. Not to send them to countries like China, India, and Africa that have not impacted their actual carbon footprint. But more importantly, Americans have done the right thing. We continue to do the right thing, but the President has done the wrong thing. He has the wrong focus. He refuses to go to our border. It's just pitiful.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Roberts: Nikki Haley Will Make America Strong and Proud Again,2023-08-08T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-roberts-nikki-haley-will-make-america-strong-and-proud-again,"
The Iowa Torch by Dawn Roberts
When I finished college (many years ago), I was looking for adventure. I thought I would find it teaching English in Maracaibo, Venezuela. During my time in the city, I found that the teaching conditions were excellent, and the weather was beautiful, but as I ventured out of that area, I was astonished by what I saw. There were people of all ages without enough food, clean water, clothes, or a bed to sleep on.
It was difficult to witness, and hard to process a life defined by a daily struggle to survive. For all our problems back home, I was overcome by an incredible wave of gratitude. My time in Venezuela was a constant reminder of how blessed I was to grow up in America.
I was raised to believe in the American Dream—the idea that anyone, no matter their circumstances, can work hard and achieve great things. The American Dream is not a cliché. It is real and I have seen it many times throughout my life. But other Americans don't seem to feel the same way.
A recent Wall Street Journal/University of Chicago poll showed 78 percent of people don't think their children's lives will be better than theirs. That is a drastic increase from the 42% of people who held the same belief in 2001.
There's another terrifying statistic. A Gallup poll last month showed American pride at an all-time low, with only 39 percent of people saying they are ""extremely proud"" to be American.
The divisiveness and plummeting national pride that exists today must stop!
If we want to change the tone in this country, we have to start at the top. We need a principled leader who will revive American strength and pride—not just in our foreign policy, but also in our everyday lives.
That leader is Nikki Haley.
Nikki's story is driven by a love for America. As the child of legal immigrants who came to this country with nothing, she grew up being told how blessed she is to live in America. It's a message she repeats constantly in her public and private life. Because for her, the American Dream is not a cliché. It is her life.
As the wife of a combat veteran whose spouse is currently deployed in Africa, Nikki knows that the freedom we enjoy isn't free. It must be protected and nourished. As a mom of two, Nikki also knows we need a new generation of leadership that will ensure the American Dream is never out of reach for our children.
Nikki proved she will fight for America as the governor of South Carolina, when she turned a double-digit unemployment state into an economic powerhouse. She proved she will fight for taxpayers when she took on the entrenched establishment in South Carolina and fought for transparency and spending cuts. She proved she will put America first when she signed one of the toughest bills tackling illegal immigration in the country.
Just as importantly, Nikki proved she will fight for America on the world stage as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. As our country faces new threats from China, Russia, and Iran, we need a leader who can go toe-to-toe with the world's dictators on day one. This is not a learning-on-the-job kind of gig.
No candidate in this presidential field has been tougher on China than Haley. She is committed to combating China on all fronts—militarily, domestically, and economically. While the Biden administration sends one official after another to make nice with Xi Jinping, Haley laid out her plan for cracking down on China's fentanyl, getting China out of our institutions, and building up our military.
Nikki Haley knows we can't be strong as a country if we aren't proud. We shouldn't apologize for American strength. We should embrace it.
My time teaching in Venezuela made me appreciate being an American citizen even more. I want all Americans to love America and to be the best they can be. Nikki Haley is uniquely qualified to deliver that message to the American people and to restore pride in this great country we are lucky to call home.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - New Hampshire State Rep. Jordan Ulrey Flips Endorsement from Trump to DeSantis,2023-08-08T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-new-hampshire-state-rep-jordan-ulrey-flips-endorsement,"
DeSantis picks up nine new endorsements in the Granite State for a total of 70 endorsements
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Ron DeSantis received nine new endorsements from New Hampshire officials today, including State Rep. Jordan Ulrey (R-Hudson) who switched his endorsement from Donald Trump to Ron DeSantis.
The full list of new endorsements:
State Representative and Salem Selectman Joe Sweeney - SalemSchool Board Member Jared Talbot - GoffstownFormer State Rep. Bill Ohm - NashuaFormer State Rep. Marc Abear - MeredithFormer State Sen. Harold French - CanterburyFormer State Rep. Tim Baxter - SeabrookFormer State Rep. Melissa Blasek - MerrimackFormer State Rep. Michael Yakubovich - Hooksett
With these additional nine endorsements, DeSantis now boasts support from 70 New Hampshire officials.
Rep. Jordan Ulrey, a fixture in the New Hampshire state Legislature, serving his ninth term, previously announced his endorsement of Trump in April but has since flipped because of DeSantis' platform to slash the DC bureaucracy, limit government, and bring down costs for New Hampshire families.
""I am proud to endorse Ron DeSantis for president,"" said Rep. Ulrey.
""He is the conservative candidate our party needs to put the focus back on the issues and unify us with a shared vision of reversing our nation's decline, which starts with sending Joe Biden back to his basement. From limiting government to slaying the bureaucratic state in D.C. to bringing energy prices down for families, Ron DeSantis is the candidate who will get things done for New Hampshire families and the American people.""
DeSantis has visited the state four times since announcing his candidacy. His most recent visit came last week when he rolled out his Declaration of Economic Independence, and he will be back later this month.

Haley Campaign Press Release - John Reagan: Nikki Haley Has My Endorsement Because She Gets it Done,2023-08-08T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-john-reagan-nikki-haley-has-my-endorsement-because-she-gets,"
New Hampshire Union Leader by John Reagan
EVERY politician makes promises but very few of our leaders have a track record of keeping promises. And in the current race for the White House, even fewer have already done what they promise to do if elected.
That's why I'm backing Nikki Haley. I recently met her at David Tille's Summer House Party. She discussed her time as a state legislator, as a two-term conservative governor, and her extensive foreign policy experience, earned as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. After she talked about what she's done, she talked about what she'll do as president: Bring back an America that's strong and proud.
Then it hit me that she's already done everything she says she'll do. She's made America stronger and prouder in every position she's ever held. And if we put her in the White House, she'll take our country to extraordinary heights.
Look at Nikki's life for proof. To start, she says she can beat the odds in a crowded field. She already did that when she primaried a 30-year incumbent in the South Carolina legislature. She started with low polls but then she proved the doubters wrong. And in the process, she made her state proud. As a lawmaker, Nikki promised to deliver transparency. She succeeded. She fought against her own party to put every legislative vote on the record, because South Carolinians deserved to know how their representatives voted 100% of the time. She got transparency across the finish line, and South Carolina is stronger for it.
Then there's Nikki's time as governor. She watched her state struggle when the textile industry went overseas. Instead of complaining, Nikki took action. She cut taxes and red tape and put workforce development at the heart of education.
It worked. Large companies like Boeing flocked to the state and small businesses put their roots down in South Carolina's small towns and cities. Nikki oversaw the creation of 85,000 jobs. More than 35,000 people moved from welfare to work. When she left, the state was at full employment, which people said would never happen.
South Carolina is stronger and prouder for Nikki Haley's leadership.

In The News: Governor DeSantis' Op-Ed in USA Today: ""America's economy is decimated. As president, I have a plan to rebuild it.""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Governor DeSantis this morning published an op-ed in USA Today highlighting his 10-point plan to reverse the decline of our nation's struggling economy and fight for the middle class by taking on the elites, DC bureaucrats, and Communist China. Read the full piece below.
Ron DeSantis: America's economy is decimated. As president, I have a plan to rebuild it.
We will declare our economic independence from the failed elites who orchestrated American decline and from never-ending federal spending that inflated prices and left nation on brink of insolvency.
Ron DeSantis
USA Today
August 7, 2023
America is in a state of decline – militarily, culturally and economically – and the American dream is slipping away from our nation's middle class.
Federal government policies – COVID-19 lockdowns, reckless borrowing, printing money and deficit spending – have escalated the costs of living so much that buying a home, purchasing a car or starting a family is too expensive for many Americans. Even being able to afford groceries has become more difficult.
Despite these challenges, entrenched Washington politicians in both parties and the elites who implemented the policies responsible for our malaise refuse to change course.
In Florida, we've fought back.
We led the charge to drag our nation out of pandemic lockdown, to protect freedom, to ensure the viability of small businesses and to preserve the education of our youth. We cut against the grain of elite opinion and faced massive blowback for bucking the system – but we stood our ground.
We fought for Floridians who were ignored by the elites, who didn't have a voice and whose livelihoods hung in the balance. We were their voice, we were their fighter – and we won.
We will take that same spirit to Washington to fight for Americans across the nation.
Revitalizing economic freedom and opportunity today will require building an economy where the concerns of average citizens are elevated above those deemed ""too big to fail.""
Our declaration of economic independence must focus our agenda on rebuilding the American dream for our middle class. We will diversify and expand our economy by rewarding hard work and empowering our citizens to control their own destinies.
We want to be a country that makes things, where a family can raise children on a single income, and where young people can develop the skills and values necessary to build a decent life and contribute to their communities.
We will declare our economic independence from the failed elites who orchestrated American decline and from the never-ending federal spending that has inflated prices and plunged our nation to the brink of insolvency.
The goal of our declaration of economic independence is simple: We win. They lose.
We will take back control of our economy from China and restore our economic sovereignty by reversing the ever-increasing trade deficit, banning imports of goods made from stolen intellectual property, end China's preferential trade status and incentivize the repatriation of U.S. capital from China.
We will facilitate stronger economic growth, with a target of at least 3%.
We will do so by advancing an ambitious tax and regulatory reform agenda to unleash American production, increase productivity and growth, and support our families, workers and small businesses, all while lowering inflation.
President Joe Biden's job-crippling and ideological regulations and executive orders will be reversed on Day One.
We will unleash our domestic energy sector, modernize and protect our power grid and advance American energy independence, thereby increasing our economic and national security, reducing inflation and fueling a manufacturing renaissance that will create jobs, revitalize our communities and improve our standard of living.
I will work not only to extend income tax cuts scheduled to expire in 2025 and to further simplify the tax code, but also seek a more competitive tax system that incentivizes long-term, domestic investment while purging special interest carveouts and loopholes.
As president, I will reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy
I will use all available constitutional authority to restore accountability in the executive branch, move agencies out of Washington, D.C., and slash the bureaucratic state, restrict foreign lobbying and post-employment revolving doors by former government officials, and ban individual stock trading by members of Congress and executive branch officials.
We will end environmental, social and governance investing standards and incentivize investment in America's future. I don't care if someone is trying to sell fossil fuels, firearms or French fries, there will be no ideological litmus test for getting a loan, establishing a bank account or running your business.
In addition to disbanding diversity, equity and inclusion programs, we will reform our education system and lower barriers to entry for working-class Americans, support school choice nationwide, protect parental rights, and steer funding toward programs and institutions that support the jobs of the future.
I will create a fair labor market by securing the border, enforcing our laws, eliminating chain migration and the diversity visa lottery, and limiting low-skill immigration.
I will rein in the Federal Reserve, fight against the reckless federal spending that has characterized recent years under both parties and oppose bailouts. There will be a new sheriff in town when it comes to spending, and I will not be afraid of using my veto pen or the bully pulpit.
Our challenge is to reclaim this century for America. If we meet the moment, a brighter future will be on the horizon. We must be a society in which Americans who work hard and get the most of their God-given abilities are able to succeed, buy a home and raise a family.
In America, we have everything we need to succeed. The only question is whether we have the will to force Washington to once again work for the American people. My promise is that I will always fight for our citizens, our families, our future and our way of life – and I will never back down.
We will take back control of our destiny and ensure that our future is proud, independent and free.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Governor DeSantis' Exclusive Sit Down with NBC's Dasha Burns,2023-08-07T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-governor-desantis-exclusive-sit-down-with-nbcs-dasha,"
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Governor DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis' exclusive interview with Dasha Burns aired tonight on NBC. Read the highlights below.
Watch the full Interview (Part 1 and Part 2).
Ron DeSantis on combatting Biden's border crisis:
""The cartels will use the children, and they will use the families to help camouflage the illicit activities. We have a statewide grand jury in Florida that's investigating all the illegal migration because we've had some come into Florida. They've actually found instances where a mother will basically rent out children to military age males because if you come in with a minor, it's better for you to do that than if you come in [alone]. What kind of a policy is this, that is incentivizing that type of behavior? What we're going to do [is] we're going to stop it. We're going to put Remain In Mexico back in. We are not going to accept bogus asylum claims. Right now, you come in, you do a bogus asylum claim, they give you a sheet of paper, come back in three years for a court date. How is that a disincentive to come illegally? And the thing is, yes, there's massive drugs killing people, sex trafficking, human trafficking, horrible. You do have criminal aliens coming across, but put all of that aside. The sheer number of people, communities are overwhelmed. We can't have, even if it was legal immigration, you can't have that much, that many people pouring into communities. It puts stress on schools. It puts stress on health care, criminal justice, the whole nine yards. So we'll stop it, we will actually build the border wall. We have good experience of getting things done in Florida, so we will do that. But I think being willing to lean in against the cartels is going to be the critical element.""
Ron DeSantis on proving the naysayers wrong:
""If I had a nickel for every naysayer I've had in my life, I'd be a very, very wealthy man. And even as Governor, people didn't give me a chance to get elected governor in the first place. Then when COVID [happened], and we took a stand against the orthodoxy and kept the state free, I was pilloried. People said my career was over. I think about leadership- even my re-election, I had people a few months before the election saying, 'Oh, his campaign is sputtering, he doesn't know, they don't know what they're doing.' And we won the biggest Republican landslide in the history of the state. So we're productive. I would much rather be underestimated. When they underestimate you, that's when we're able to strike. And you know, I think that it's been something that when people see that you're willing to show up and work, that is not something that every candidate is willing to do. And we are doing it. We're going to earn the nomination, and we're going to get the job done.""
Casey DeSantis on her battle with breast cancer and support from her husband:
""He was there for me. And he was there to go pick up my kids when I couldn't. And he did it with humility and he did it with love. And I'll tell you what, you can't ask for a better husband than that.""
Casey DeSantis on why Governor DeSantis is the best candidate:
""I saw him standing up to people in Washington, D.C. who were telling him you're doing it wrong, you have to shut down the beaches, you have to lock kids out of school. So when you see that firsthand, and you understand the fight that he was taking, like why would I not be in this fight? Why would I not want to be out there singing from the rooftop that this is a good dude?""

CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott toured the southern border near Yuma, Arizona where he met with ranchers and law enforcement. Tim then visited a medical center to host a roundtable with those impacted by the Biden border crisis, the fentanyl epidemic, and human trafficking. During the roundtable, he heard from medical providers, law enforcement, ranchers, and community leaders.
Tim's plan to combat the border crisis includes finishing the border wall, deploying military-grade technology at our border and ports of entry to stop illegal drugs and human trafficking, and designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Read Tim's op-ed in The New York Post on his plan to secure the border and end the fentanyl crisis.
Watch Tim's roundtable in Yuma, AZ here.
Watch Tim Scott's FOX News interview from the border here.

Tim Scott speaking at the Yuma roundtable: ""I was at the border in 2019, and the thing that has changed the most is Joe Biden coming into office has allowed for more than 6 million folks to cross our border illegally... And equally important is the 70,000 Americans who have lost their lives to fentanyl... The importance of building the wall – finishing the wall, using the available technology to surveil our border to stop the flow of fentanyl across our border.
""Really important: crushing the Mexican drug cartels is absolutely essential. As President of the United States, I would sign the legislation I created that would freeze the assets of the Mexican cartels. We have the power to do that...
""And find a way to bring more border patrol agents to our border by eliminating the 87,000 IRS agents that were part of the Inflation Reduction Act. I am hopeful to use those resources to provide more security on our border.""

New York Post Op-Ed by Tim Scott: How I'll secure the border and end the fentanyl crisis killing our towns,2023-08-04T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/new-york-post-op-ed-tim-scott-how-ill-secure-the-border-and-end-the-fentanyl-crisis,"
Under President Joe Biden, America has become a nation in retreat.
We have retreated from strength abroad, safe streets at home and even from our own sovereign borders.
Illegal border crossings have set record highs each year of the Biden presidency.
Fentanyl is also flowing across the border and into our neighborhoods at record highs. Overdose deaths are on the rise.
If you couldn't control who came in through your back door, your house wouldn't really be your house.
When we don't control our southern border, it's not our country.
More than 7 million people and counting have crossed our border illegally on Biden's watch, including nearly 200 on the terrorist watch list — and those are just the ones we caught.
Estimates suggest an additional 1.2 million illegal immigrants have crossed the border but evaded capture and simply vanished into the interior.
That adds up to more than 8 million illegal border crossers under this administration.
That is more people than the population of 38 states, including my home state of South Carolina.
It's more than the populations of Iowa and New Hampshire combined.
I am witnessing this disaster firsthand this week in Yuma, Arizona.
I'm meeting with the law-enforcement agents, doctors, nurses and property owners who spend every day on the front lines of Biden's border crisis.
But the truth is there are not just four southern-border states. There are 50.
Every county in America is a border county.
Every time I visit Iowa — where overdose deaths among those under 25 have more than doubled just since 2019 — I am in a border county.
Every time I visit New Hampshire — which has the nation's fastest-rising overdose-death rate — I am in a border county.
Every time I'm back in South Carolina, speaking with grieving parents — like my friend Alan Shao, the former dean of the College of Charleston business school who lost his 27-year-old son and namesake to fentanyl — I am in a border county.
Each year, fentanyl claims 70,000 American lives.
That means we lose more Americans to this one illegal drug every 10 months than we lost in the entire Vietnam War.
But Biden is missing in action.
He has no plan to secure the border.
He has no plan to disrupt the supply chain that connects Chinese chemicals to Mexican drug cartels and creates fentanyl.
He has no energy, no ideas and no vision for ending this shameful retreat from our own sovereign soil and getting control of our back door.
This shouldn't be hard. And when I am commander in chief, it won't be.
I will restart construction to finish the border wall and deploy the latest and greatest military-grade technology to crack down on drug smuggling and human trafficking at our entry ports.
I will cancel Biden's 87,000 new IRS agents and double Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to 87,000 agents instead.
Democrats' priority is auditing and harassing American taxpayers and small businesses. My priority is stopping the people and drugs pouring into our country illegally.
The far left had no problem closing your children's schools and your family's church to supposedly slow a virus' spread.
But they refuse to close our border to reduce crime and stop illegal drugs that are killing more young people than COVID ever did.
I have already authored a bill to reinstate Title 42 and fast deportations until we have a handle on the fentanyl emergency. When I'm in the Oval Office, I'll sign it into law.
I will delete the Biden administration's new smartphone app that provides concierge service to illegal immigrants, end catch-and-release and hire 1,000 new immigration judges so we can stop releasing people into our heartland with a polite invitation to a hearing often multiple years away.
I will implement a zero-tolerance policy for illegal immigrants with criminal records.
If you've broken the law to get here and you break our laws again, the day your prison sentence ends, you aren't going free on American soil — you're going back where you came from.
I'm sure the far left will call this radical. Everybody else calls it common sense.
And I will be the commander in chief who takes off the kid gloves and treats the Mexican drug cartels killing Americans like the foreign terrorist organizations they are.
I will freeze their assets, sanction their bank accounts, break their supply chains and use every power of the presidency to end the cartels before they end more American lives.
The far left says caring about the border is racist.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims even talking about our illegal-immigration emergency is ""white supremacy.""
I can't wait until they try to play that card on me.
Every single American deserves safe streets, drug-free neighborhoods and secure borders.
And when I'm in the White House, they'll get them.

ICYMI: Governor DeSantis at WMUR's 'Conversation with the Candidate'Town Hall
""I'm the only candidate running who can win the primary, defeat Joe Biden, and deliver on all the things we know need to be done""
MANCHESTER, N.H. – Governor DeSantis joined Adam Sexton at the WMUR Studio in Manchester, New Hampshire earlier this week for WMUR's 'Conversation with the Candidate' town hall series. The conversation, which aired tonight, featured a sit-down interview segment with Adam Sexton followed by a Q&A session with New Hampshire voters. The highlights are below.
Watch part one of the town hall HERE and part two HERE.
On how he would handle the growing drug problem due to cartels:
Day one, we're declaring [the border crisis] a national emergency. I'm going to mobilize all available resources, including our military, to go to the border. We're going to stop the invasion. Yes, we will build a border wall, but I think most importantly, I'm going to do what no President has been willing to do. We are going to lean in against the cartels directly and we are going to use deadly force against them. They're cutting through fencing. They are coming right across with fentanyl strapped to their back, killing tens of thousands of people in this country, and Biden is just letting it happen. If you give them pushback, you are going to change the equation. We have tens of thousands of people dying in this country from fentanyl overdose. Mothers all across this country have had to bury loved ones because that poison is coming in...we're also going to have a taskforce to do maritime operations because they're bringing in the precursor chemicals from China. And then the cartels are making the fentanyl. We're going to interdict that. I mean, when have we ever allowed thousands, hundreds of thousands of Americans to die at the hands of, what I think these cartels are, effectively foreign terrorist organizations? So buckle up, there's a new sheriff in town on January 20, 2025.
On what woke means and why it's harmful to Americans:
Woke is a form of Cultural Marxism. It's about taking individuality, merit, and achievement, and subordinating that to a political agenda based on identity politics. It is effectively displacing the truth in favor of ideology. And I think it's important that we fight against that because our society does need to be rooted in truth. Don't tell me that a man can get pregnant and expect me to believe that. That is not true, and we can't govern our society based on things that are not true. Second, when that ideology takes hold of institutions, it corrodes the institutions, and it produces bad results. For example, when you have woke overtake parts of the economy with things like ESG, they attack energy, they affect other things; the average person ends up poorer as a result of that. When woke overtakes education, you get indoctrination, and students end up performing worse as a result of that. When you have ideological prosecutors get into office in cities like San Francisco, they stop prosecuting criminals, the inmates run the asylum, [and] the average person ends up less safe as a result of that. Every jurisdiction in this country that has indulged in this type of leftism, every city or state has failed. How do I know that? Because people that are fleeing are coming to my state in Florida and they're telling me the story about it. So this is not just an academic debate, it's 'do we want policy based on tried and true principles, enduring principles that have made our country great,' or are we going to go on some ideological joyride, let people out of prison, do this, do that, and see our quality of life be destroyed? Woke needs to die.
On how he will lower the cost of energy:
We are going to open up all of our domestic energy production. We have the most oil and gas of any country in the world. And what Biden is doing, he wants to kneecap that. First of all, that means people pay more, it means businesses pay more to produce their products, it has a bad impact on our economy, fewer jobs. So opening that up [means] more jobs, more industry, expands our industrial base, it does lower inflation when you see the cost of oil and natural gas go down. But here's the thing, we will be more secure as a country to be energy independent. We should never ask Maduro for oil. We should never have to do Iran or the Middle East or any of these people. So when you're doing that, who does that weaken, when we're energy independent? It weakens Vladimir Putin, it weakens Iran, it weakens Venezuela. Isn't that something that's good for our national security? I think this whole idea of a Green New Deal, they're trying to force a transition on society that is not ready to happen. California is trying to do that. They have blackouts, they literally said you're going to have to do an electric car, all new cars are going to have to be electric in five years or something like that. They make that announcement, then two days later, they make an announcement, 'all electrical vehicle owners: do not plug in your vehicle, because we can't support it on the power grid.' So how is this supposed to even work? And by the way, forcing people to buy an electric vehicle, who does that benefit? It benefits China, because all the parts that go into producing those are produced in China. That is not good for our national security. So let's use what we have. And in Florida, we've had a huge reduction in emissions over the last 10, 20 years, and a lot of that is because you're using natural gas in place of coal. We do have some solar that is economical now that people are using, but that's because of innovation, that's not because of government mandates.
On how he would handle Big Pharma as president:
We pay more for drugs in the United States than any other developed country. Why? Because pharmaceutical companies — we spend money to develop these things, but then the other countries get them cheaper, and they charge us higher to be able to recoup that intellectual property and the investment. I think that that should be spread around all these developed countries. Why should we be the only ones that are paying through our nose, and they get to pay less? And so there are things that, in that sense we can do — I actually worked with the Trump administration, there was a provision of law that allowed states to buy prescription drugs from Canada- they were the same drugs and they're like 25%, the cost. I could have saved hundreds of millions of dollars in Florida. Trump administration ended, Biden said they were going to do it, here we are two and a half, three years later, [and] they still have not approved our ability to purchase those drugs. I just think that the way pharmaceuticals have driven the cost, we're never going to get the cost under control if we continue with the same failed model.
On combatting the weaponization of the DOJ:
Clearly, if you have people that are being targeted on their race or religion, that's something that we need to snuff out, and will want to do it. I think the problem with this in [the] FBI and Department of Justice is they view anybody on this other side of the political spectrum as a potential target. There was a memo in one of the FBI field offices that said, 'these Catholics that are attending Latin Mass are potentially a problem.' No, that is outrageous that they're doing that. They will say, we have a parent's rights group in Florida called Moms for Liberty, and some of these left-wing groups have called them a hate group. They are not hate group. Just because they disagree with you, just because they're advocating conservative positions, you don't label them a hate group. So I think those agencies have gone way out of bounds. We will use it to go against racial discrimination, we will use it to go against religious discrimination. But we are not going to let the FBI and the DOJ be weaponized against political factions that they disagree with. That is wrong, and that is an impulse that has really been nurtured over the last decade or so in Washington, in the bowels of the bureaucracy. These are all people that think one way. They have these views on the left and they think if you disagree with that, somehow you're a threat to society. That is wrong, and that will not be tolerated in my administration.
On why he is the only person who can beat Joe Biden:
I'm not running for President to be somebody, I'm running to do something. I think 2024 is a hinge point in American history. I think I'm the only candidate running who can win the primary, defeat Joe Biden, and then deliver on all of these things that we know that needs to be done. So I feel a calling to offer myself to service...I don't care about what happens, the future, holding office, all that stuff. I have the ability to go get the job done for the country now. I don't think we have four years to be able to wait. And I think it could end up getting a lot worse, if we don't do something now. Also, this is a republic. This isn't a monarchy, there's not bloodlines, nobody's chosen for their term, you got to go and you got to earn it. When you start talking about states like New Hampshire with the first in the nation, you got to show up and answer questions. You got to go to events, you got to be here. You got to show people why you should be the next President of the United States. Nobody is entitled to be nominated, much less elected president.

CHARLESTON, SC –  This morning, Tim Scott joined FOX News' America's Newsroom to discuss his visit to the U.S. souther border. Tim is in Yuma, Arizona where he is touring the Southern border and hosting a roundtable discussion with community leaders and those on the front lines of Biden's border crisis.
Watch the full interview here
Tim ScottAmerica's NewsroomAugust 4, 2023
Dana Perino: Senator, I know that you went to the border in 2019. Well, what did you learn that's different now? What did you see that's different? What disturbs you? What do you think could be fixed?
Sen Scott: Well, Dana, the biggest difference between 2019 and now, two words: Joe Biden. When you have a president who unleashes a wide open, unsafe, insecure border, we cannot be surprised by more than 6 million illegal crossings. However, the devastation of 70,000 Americans who lost their lives to fentanyl because Joe Biden refuses to close our southern border. Preventable. As President of the United States, I will finish this wall and I will use the available technology to surveil our border to stop fentanyl from killing another 70,000 Americans in the next 12 months.
Dana Perino: Did you have a chance to talk to some local people there, and what do they make of this recent surge? We can pull up, call for number one. July compared to June, there were 130,000 arrests in July. There were only about a hundred thousand in June. So there's a pretty dramatic uptick. What do they put that down to? Because the Biden administration says that they've been doing a pretty good job.
Sen Scott: Well, the Biden Administration continues to tell the American people believe what we say and not what you see with your own eyes. I've had an opportunity already to speak with law enforcement. They tell me that the surge continues. I'll meet after we leave the border right now with community leaders and frankly, with folks who lost their kids to fentanyl. The devastation that we are experiencing as Americans is preventable. Much of it is preventable. If we finish the wall, use technology, fire Joe Biden and hire me, I will be the president that finishes the wall and takes seriously the opportunity to save tens of thousands of Americans from the drug of fentanyl.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Reader Opinion: Haley's Ground Game in NH is Unmatched,2023-08-04T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-reader-opinion-haleys-ground-game-nh-unmatched,"
The Keene Sentinel by Terri Hansel
Nikki Haley offers a new generation of leadership, a different style and approach. She tackles tough issues in a way that brings people together. Nikki's dedication to the voters of the Granite State is astounding. Her most recent swing through the North Country brought Nikki's total stops on the campaign trail up to 41 and Nikki is making plans to come back again. Nikki held two town halls in both Barrington and Hollis last week alone. No other presidential candidate shows as much hard work and determination as Nikki Haley when it comes to her ground game in New Hampshire. Nikki is determined to meet, what it seems like, every Granite State voter.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Republican Presidential Hopeful Nikki Haley to Appear in New Political Ad Attacking China,2023-08-04T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-republican-presidential-hopeful-nikki-haley-appear-new,"
Des Moines Register by F. Amanda Tugade
A new campaign ad promoting Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley's stance toward China is hitting Iowa's airwaves starting Tuesday.
Sponsored by SFA Fund, a federal Super PAC that supports Haley, the 30-second ad features the former governor of South Carolina and U.N. ambassador in a montage directly calling out China's leaders for their plans to ""cover the world in Communist tyranny.""
""Communist China won't just lose. Like the Soviet Union before it, Communist China will end up on the ash heap of history,"" Haley said in the ad, her remarks met with applause from a crowd.
The commercial ends with a voice overhead, dubbing the 51-year-old as a ""strong leader for a strong America.""
The political TV ad is a first for the SFA Fund and comes as Haley boosts her campaign efforts in Iowa.
Just two weeks after attending the Family Leadership Summit, Haley returned to Des Moines Friday for the sold-out Lincoln Dinner event.
Haley was among 13 Republican candidates who made a 10-minute presidential pitch to more than 1,000 guests. The following day, she held a town hall event for voters in Iowa City, which is two hours east of Des Moines.
Haley plans to return to the Hawkeye State this Sunday for a barbecue event hosted by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Marion Republican, and the following weekend for the Iowa State Fair, which includes a ""Fair-Side Chat"" with Gov. Kim Reynolds and the Des Moines Register's Soapbox.
SFA Fund paid $7 million for the commercial to air on broadcast and cable TV in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids — and statewide on Fox News Channel and satellite TV over the next nine weeks. A similar seconds-long ad will run in New Hampshire during the same time.
Mark Harris, SFA Fund's lead strategist, told the Register that the second phase of Haley's campaign has begun and the new political ad is meant to help the effort.
""Unlike other political leaders, Nikki Haley understands that China's growing influence poses a monumental threat to the United States,"" Harris said in a news release. ""Whether it's a farmer impacted by dubious Chinese trading practices, businesses worried about hacks or balloons spying on our servicemen and women, Americans can count on Nikki Haley to have their back.""
Haley on the campaign trail has said that the U.S. needs to be tougher on adversaries such as China, Russia and Iran. Over the weekend, at a town hall event in Iowa City, Haley told more than 50 attendees that China is the ""biggest national security threat"" and listed some ways that the country has ""completely infiltrated the U.S.""
""China has been planning a war with us for years, and no one else is talking about it,"" she said during the town hall event Saturday at Wildwood Smokehouse & Saloon in Iowa City. ""And that's not being dramatic.""
""They are sending over fentanyl, knowing exactly what it's doing when it's killing Americans. They are giving millions of dollars to our universities so they can steal research and spread Chinese propaganda. They have Chinese front companies lobbying our Congress for the Communist Party.""

""For me to have gotten all these endorsements in South Carolina, given that you have your own politicians running, it shows that when people see us and what we've been able to accomplish, they come on board.""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Governor Ron DeSantis today hosted a virtual press conference with South Carolina media. The highlights are below.
Watch the full press conference HERE.
On his new slew of South Carolina endorsements:
As president, I'm going to be the one that would be most likely to actually get all the things we want done, from economy, to energy independence, to finally securing the border and taking on the drug cartels, to holding the medical swamp accountable, people like Dr. Fauci, for what they did during COVID. For fighting back against woke ideology and supporting parents rights and our school children, to reconstituting our military [and] getting them back to mission first, putting us in a position to be able to check and deter China, and then reining in the administrative state and ending the weaponization of government. We have the ability to put that out there in a way that nobody else can. And I think that there's a reason why we're seeing this galvanize support in places like the early states and for me to have gotten all those these endorsements in South Carolina, given that you guys have to have your own politicians running. I think that shows that when people see us, when they see what we've been able to accomplish, they come on board, and we're going to continue to build support. So I'm very optimistic about our pathway there.
On his momentum in the early states:
In terms of South Carolina, we've really enjoyed being there. Obviously we're going to be there a lot more. The calendar is a little bit different this year than in years past. You're going to have Iowa in mid-January, next week you're going to have New Hampshire, you have about a month before you have South Carolina. It's going to be a lot of campaigning in South Carolina. I think, clearly, candidates that don't do well in the first two states are not going to be viable at that point, and so I think it'll be very narrow by the time we get to South Carolina. We'll be one of the candidates that will be there, and we're going to be competing very, very hard. If you look at how South Carolina lines up, I'm a great candidate for the state. You look at the upstate region, these are voters that see a Governor like me who has produced and delivered results on the issues that they care about, that reflects their values, and [who] is somebody that that they can be proud of as a leader. If you look at some places like the low country, my wife went to College of Charleston, we've got a lot of roots in that area. Her sister is an Air Force pilot, and was stationed in Charleston. And so those areas - Charleston and Hilton Head and then even as you get into places like Myrtle Beach, we haven't been there yet, but those are great areas for us.
On his Declaration of Economic Independence:
On Monday, we announced our 10-point economic plan, which was really the most thorough plan that's been put forth in terms of dealing with the economy, and we've got a great platform to be able to do that. Since I've been governor, Florida's economy has outperformed every state in the nation, certainly all the big states. We're currently ranked as the number one economy in the country by CNBC. We're number one for new business formations. We're number one for net in-migration. We're number one for economic growth amongst large states. Our unemployment rate is a percentage point below the national average and even more [below] other large states like California and New York. And functionally in Florida, if you want a job, you can get it. We're also ranked number one in education by US News and World Report. No state income tax, which is a really good thing. Our crime rate is at a 50-year low. And since I've been governor, we've run big budget surpluses on an annual basis and have actually paid down almost 25% of our state's total accumulated debt. And so that's really the way that you build an economy.

Haley Campaign Press Release - I'm Proud My Daughter Admires Nikki Haley,2023-08-03T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-im-proud-my-daughter-admires-nikki-haley,"
The Gazette by Emily Schmitt
My 7-year-old daughter watched Nikki Haley command the lawn, surrounded by hundreds of Iowa voters, speaking with purpose and pride.
""I want to be her when I grow up,"" she declared.
I am a mom. A wife. A business leader. A conservative. I am an Iowa Republican who believes our party deserves a presidential candidate our children can look up to. Perhaps that is old-fashioned of me. But this is Iowa. We like our old-fashioned traditions. We enjoy family dinners around the kitchen table. We go to church. We teach our daughters and sons to respect their elders and treat people with kindness.
The Republican Party used to be the party of character. In 2001, Peggy Noonan wrote an entire book about her time in the Reagan administration called When Character Was King. She shared stories that embodied Reagan's strength of character. Remember when those were qualities to be admired?
I have watched the parade of national candidates every four years with a sense of fatigue. I am tired of supporting ""but"" candidates. So-and-so is disrespectful but … No more buts. No more excuses. No more vindictive chaos. No more embarrassing drama.
In Nikki Haley, Republicans have a candidate they can relate to and look up to. Like so many Iowa women, she is a working mom, who balanced the demands of family life while she served in the state legislature and as governor. When you talk to her, you find out that she is a real person who is obsessed with her Clemson Tigers, loves music, and lights up when someone hands her a baby to hold.
As governor, she took on the establishment in South Carolina and made government more accountable, transparent, and conservative. She faced natural disasters and a mass shooting with decisiveness and compassion that saved lives. Her number one focus as governor was turning South Carolina's double-digit unemployment into a thriving jobs state because she knows that families can't survive without good jobs.
She also instinctively understands the human and emotional part of being a leader. When a South Carolina eighth-grader sent Gov. Haley a suicide letter describing the bullying she faced at school, Haley picked up the phone and called the young girl. Inspired by the writer, Haley launched an anti-bullying campaign that took her to schools across the state.
Haley is proof that women don't have to back down or pipe down. In this strident political era, she is proof that you can be principled and tough without losing yourself to the gutter.
In this age of identity politics, Haley embraces being a woman without making a victim of women. In fact, she sees her gender as a strength and point of pride. She heralds Iowa's many female elected leaders and likes to say ""Iowa grows strong women."" She's right. Iowans have a history of voting for tough-as-nails women from Gov. Kim Reynolds to Sen. Joni Ernst to our congresswomen. I am hopeful we will vote for another tough-as-nails woman in the Iowa caucuses next year. She is the best Republican candidate by far and one that can actually win a general election. It would be good for Iowa and America, and it is what we need.

ICYMI: Governor DeSantis Agrees to Debate Gavin Newsom on Best Path Forward for Country's Future
""Let's get it done. Tell me when and where""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — On Fox News' Hannity tonight, Governor Ron DeSantis agreed to debate Gavin Newsom on the best path forward for the future of the country. Read the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On debating Gavin Newsom:
Absolutely, I'm game. Let's get it done. Just tell me when and where. We'll do it. And here's the thing. I mean in one respect, the debate between California and Florida has already been had, as you suggest. People have been voting on that. They've been voting on it with their feet. They have fled California in record numbers. Florida has been the number one state for net in-migration. We have the number one ranked economy, number one now in education, crime rate at a 50-year low. But in another sense, this is the debate for the future of our country, because you have people like Joe Biden [who] would love to see the Californication of the United States. Biden may not even be the nominee. You could have Gavin Newsom, you could have Kamala Harris. And I think if we go down that direction, that's going to accelerate American decline. We can't see America decline anymore. We need to reverse American decline.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Pro-Nikki Haley PAC Debuts $13 Million Ad Buys in Iowa and New Hampshire,2023-08-01T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-pro-nikki-haley-pac-debuts-13-million-ad-buys-iowa-and-new,"
Washington Examiner by Julia Johnson
The super PAC backing former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley's presidential bid made its first ad buys in key primary and caucus states New Hampshire and Iowa.
Stand for America is shelling out $13 million to debut the new ad in New Hampshire and Iowa for nine weeks beginning on Tuesday.
The 30-second ad will air across broadcast, cable, and digital in the states and highlight Haley's unique foreign policy credentials.
Titled ""Stop China,"" the video recalls Haley's experience in former President Donald Trump's administration, saying she ""fought America's enemies at the U.N. and won.""
""Nikki Haley: Tough as nails, smart as a whip, unafraid to speak,"" it continued.
It also features footage from one of Haley's speeches, during which she said, ""Communist China won't just lose like the Soviet Union before. Communist China will end up on the ash heap of history.""
The line alluded to former President Ronald Reagan's famous speech promising that communism would be left in ""the ash heap of history.""
Neither the campaign nor Haley's super PAC had purchased any ads for the 2024 primary race until now.
In the second quarter of 2023, Haley's campaign reported raising over $7 million. It also had $9.3 million in cash on hand. SFA pulled in $18.7 million during the same quarter and had $17 million in cash on hand.
This comes as the two top competitors for the Republican presidential nomination face criticism for high burn rates, as Trump pays off extensive legal bills and DeSantis's campaign overextended its resources — leading to a large staffing cut and campaign reset.
GOP strategists have emphasized the importance of resources, particularly cash, in sustaining a campaign for the long run. There remain just over five months until the first Republican caucuses, and Haley appears to be approaching campaign expenditures more cautiously than the leading contenders.
The former South Carolina governor's team emphasized to reporters Haley's ability to endure the campaign season financially, pointing to several prominent high-dollar donors to her.

New Hampshire Union Leader by Kim Rice
THERE WAS a time when people could dismiss drug overdoses as something that happened to other people. Not anymore. Today, most people know someone — relative, friend, neighbor — who has died from the fentanyl crisis overwhelming our country.
I should know. A few years ago, my brother's wife thought she was taking a Percocet but it was laced with fentanyl. My niece and nephew lost their mother.
My sister-in-law is one of the 70,000-plus people who die from overdoses of opioids like fentanyl every year. Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-49. New Hampshire has been particularly hard hit. Our small state saw 486 people dying from a drug overdose in 2022. That's the highest number since 2017, and that number is increasing in New Hampshire faster than the rest of the country.
These people are not hardened criminals. They are mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, and coworkers. They are people with big lives and big dreams. They leave behind broken families who will never be the same.
What are we going to do about it? In the state legislature, I saw a lot of bills that dealt with the aftereffects of this crisis. But if we really want to solve this crisis, we need an all-encompassing plan, and we need to disrupt the flow of fentanyl at its source.
No presidential candidate is talking about this deadly poison more than Nikki Haley. I attended her community discussion recently hosted by the Freedom Movement, an organization that helps people struggling with addiction. A few months ago, she hosted a roundtable with law enforcement officials to get a better understanding on how the fentanyl crisis is affecting our men and women in blue.
According to Haley, stopping the fentanyl crisis has to start with China, and no candidate has been tougher on China than the feisty former United Nations ambassador.
Much of the fentanyl killing our citizens comes from China in the form of fentanyl precursors — chemicals that are sent from China to Mexico to be processed and made into synthetic pills.
These pills are then smuggled across the United States border through normal ports of entry. Some of it is discovered and seized. In 2022, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration seized 58.4 million fentanyl-lace fake pills and more than 13,000 pounds of fentanyl powder — equal to more than 387.6 million lethal doses of fentanyl and enough to kill every American. But much of the drugs make their way into the United States where they are dispatched across the country through a network of drug dealers.
Haley's plan to combat China is extensive. It involves building up our military, getting China out of our universities, cracking down on the export of sensitive technologies to China, and many other important steps. She also calls for ending normal trade relations with China if the communists don't stop sending fentanyl our way.
This may not seem like a big step to the average citizen, but Haley's plan is a major departure from decades of bipartisan policy that believed we could change China if we grew closer to the communist regime. In return, China has been spying on America, stealing our information and technology, infiltrating our universities, hacking our government, lying about COVID, threatening our allies, and sending deadly drugs to our shores.
Enough. As Haley tells it, ""China is not our friend. China is our enemy."" We need a leader who recognizes this growing threat and has the iron will to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party. Amazingly, there are 13 Republicans in the presidential race — 12 men and one woman — and only one of them has the metaphorical balls to get the job done.
Haley has made combating the China threat a top priority. She knows what's at stake, and she knows we don't have time to waste. Joe Biden has done the opposite. Over the past few months, he sent three members of his administration to make nice with China and got nothing done on fentanyl. Needless to say, Xi Jinping was not impressed.
In Haley we have a leader who isn't ashamed of American strength. On the contrary, she knows that our national strength is the best tool we have for combatting China and saving our loved ones. It's up to us to make sure she's in the position to get the job done.

""I'm not running to be president, I'm running to do things as president and now is the time the country needs help.""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Today, Ron DeSantis joined Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News Channel. Read the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On his Declaration of Economic Independence:
I think it's important point out nationally, whatever you say about the ""strength,"" a lot of that is driven by Florida and Texas and the red states, let's just be honest. We have way more people employed in Florida than we did prior to COVID. That's not true with a lot of the blue states. So Biden would hype all these job gains over the last couple of years, [but] Florida, Texas, and a handful of states are really driving it. I think we've been able to push back effectively. But even if inflation ""is less,"" those prices are not going down. So you have a situation now where [for] a middle-class family, affording a home is prohibitive. If you look at the median income compared to the median home price, there's a bigger gap than there was when the financial crisis hit after the big housing increase in 2006 and 2007. Cars are becoming less affordable, people feel that squeeze. And it's because Biden [is] more interested in pursuing his ideological agenda through the economy. And when he's attacking American energy, that is not good for the average person. It's not good for businesses. It's not good for national security. But they care more about that agenda than they do about the well-being of middle-class families. And so that's not changing. That's going to be the case. And I think I also ultimately, I have a good record to be able to say, 'whose economy has led the way over these past many years?' And Florida has led the way.
On the false narrative about Florida's African American education standards:
Kamala Harris got on a jet, at taxpayer expense, and flew to Florida to lie about the African American history standards that were developed. You can't bend the knee to the Left's lies. When the Left lies and creates these phony narratives, you've got to push it back. They've been doing this to Republicans for years and years, [and] Republicans bend the knee. And it's just one thing after another. Second, this goes into the whole fight on indoctrination in schools. We eliminated critical race theory a couple of years ago. When we did that, the media lied and the left lied, saying you don't want to teach about African American history, equating political activism and CRT with black history. I said no, not only in the bill it says that, but you've got to do all these things, teach about injustice, teach about discrimination. So these standards were born out of the fight against CRT because this is true history. It was done. And by the way, we're one of 13 or 14 states that even have African American history standards. So it was done by black history scholars, the head was the former chairman of the US Commission on Civil Rights, most of them were black. If you read those standards, there is no way you can come away from that with anything other than this is the gory details.
On standing up to China:
We're going to have a strategy of denial so that China is not going to be able to pull the trigger on that, given the amount of hard power that's in the region, given the levers we can pull on the economy. But that's kind of the main crux of our strategy to be able to deny that, I think Taiwan is an ally. I think that Taiwan is of significance to our country, of course, both militarily, diplomatically, and economically, and our goal should be to stop — China respects hard power. If they think the costs are going to exceed any potential benefits, they are not going to do it. I do think under Biden, we're on a course where in the next five or 10 years, they probably would be able to take it. If we change course, I think we could prevent it.
On how he kept Florida free during COVID lockdowns:
I fought his [Trump's] administration to keep our state open [and] have kids in school. Fauci, the task force, all those people. They were sending me missives, and the press in Florida was having a field day with this because they'd send me missives to my office. July of 2020, close businesses, no schools. Fall of 2020, close businesses, impose a mask mandate. Even January of 2021, right before he left office, his task force was telling us in Florida to close, and so he didn't have control over his own government. He didn't have control over Fauci. Fauci ran that government. His last year in office, Trump should have fired him. He did not do that. He elevated Fauci and he made Fauci an international celebrity, and here's the thing. I fought back against it. And you know all the flack that I got from the media during that and people fled to Florida because we were free, and I was happy to make that stand. But the reality is Fauci's policies were adopted in a lot of the blue states. Kids were locked out of school for a year, you had businesses shuttered for good. Knowing what we know now, that was a catastrophic mistake, and we cannot let that happen to America again.
On bringing energy to the executive:
I do think we need an energetic executive as President. We need somebody that's going to get in there on day one, and spit nails and not look back. You only have a finite period of time to get things done in two terms, eight years. But as you know, the way the political cycle works, there are times when the iron is hot, when you first get in, maybe you get reelected, you got to be able to capitalize on all of this. And so with me, they will get somebody in there who's going to run ragged. We're going to have the media, they're not going to be able to keep up with us. The left isn't going to be able to keep up with us. And also during the campaign, I am not going to let Biden get away with being in the basement for the campaign. We're gonna run him ragged around this country. And we're going to show a huge contrast with energy and vitality versus somebody who really is not fit to do the job.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Governor DeSantis today joined Fox News' Harris Faulkner on The Faulkner Focus. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On the weaponization of the DOJ:
One of the reasons I'm running for president is to re-constitutionalize the federal government. These agencies that have become weaponized, the FBI [and] the DOJ, against political opponents, that's a result of them not being held constitutionally accountable for many, many years. So when I'm President, we will bring accountability. We will end weaponization in regard to new leadership at the FBI, DOJ. We're going to take power out of DC. We're going to return it to the American people. But one of the things I mentioned, that statement is important to point out. The reality is, a DC jury would indict a ham sandwich and convict a ham sandwich if it was a Republican ham sandwich. I think Americans need to be able to move cases out of DC. I think the juries are stacked. I think that they're going to want to convict people that they disagree with, or at a minimum, you should be able to draw jury pool from across the entire country. That is really what's at stake in terms of, do we have a single standard of justice? Or do we have a track of justice where if you're connected to the swamp, you get off, whether it's Hunter Biden, whether it was the guy Durham tried to prosecute, or are we going to live under a single rule of law? I think we have to reestablish a single rule of law in this country.
On proving the naysayers wrong:
I don't think anyone running on our side that's had as much political success as me. We won big elections throughout my career, including the best Republican governor victory in the history of the state of Florida, where we're winning women by almost double digits. We're winning Miami Dade County by double digits. Winning over 60% of Hispanics and winning independents by 18%. So we've got a record of success, and you're going to be able to see that as this campaign goes on. So the naysayers have always hit me for my entire time as governor. People wrote me off during COVID because I was taking a strong stance against people like Fauci, but we lead and we deliver results and that's why we've been successful. We'll continue to be successful in this campaign.
On Florida's economic success:
Since I've been governor, we've actually paid down 25% of our state's debt. We run massive budget surpluses. CNBC ranks us number one of all 50 states for the economy. US News ranks us number one for education amongst all 50 states and our crime rate is at a 50-year low. And as you mentioned, since I've been governor, there's been more wealth moved into the state of Florida than has ever moved into another state in the history of the United States over a similar period of time. This is all in spite of COVID lockdowns that we bucked, Bidenomics, all this stuff. So we take that know-how and bring that to Washington DC. We're going to get this economy in a much better place for small business people and for middle class families.
On combatting false media narratives about Florida's education standards:
Those are criticisms in bad faith, because as you suggest, there's hundreds of pages of painstaking detail. This was done by black history scholars, most of whom were black themselves. They are not shilling for slavery, they are showing the injustice of slavery. But that particular passage wasn't saying that slavery was a benefit. They were saying there was resourcefulness, and people acquired skills in spite of slavery, not because of it, and then they used those when they achieved their freedom. Incidentally, Kamala Harris endorsed an AP African American History course, which we in Florida rejected because they had Marxist studies, they had other left-wing things in it that had the same exact provision. And you've seen that same basic provision had been in other curriculum. Nobody ever said anything. And indeed, nobody said anything about this. These guys put this together in a public fashion... most states don't even have black history standards. We're one of only 14 or 15 states. When we eliminated critical race theory, people lied then, saying we didn't want to teach about the history of African Americans. In reality, that same bill required us to develop even stronger standards, and that's why this working group was created. So they did a good job. I think it's wrong to demagogue people. And I think that a guy like me, I'm fighting back against false narratives. I do not let people like Harris or the media take false narratives and run with it. We will stand our ground and we will speak the truth.

What They Are Saying: ""Ron DeSantis Will Revive The Middle Class.""
ROCHESTER, NH — Governor Ron DeSantis today rolled out his Declaration of Economic Independence at a New Hampshire manufacturing facility alongside local business owners and workers. Desantis' detailed, 10-point plan will reverse the decline of our nation's struggling economy and fight for the middle class by taking on the elites, DC bureaucrats, and Communist China.
Click here to read the full plan.
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING:
Christian Whiton, former Trump admin official: _""What DeSantis did today was fairly remarkable. A lot of detail, to make work for the middle class, not for BlackRock. The usual conventional wisdom is don't get too detailed, but DeSantis sort of sticking his neck out here with a lot of specific policy."" _
Jason Chaffetz: ""Governor DeSantis had it absolutely right. Look, the Federal Reserve is trying to tighten the money supply. At the same time the federal government is increasing the money supply. You can't have the federal government just spending in perpetuity. Bidenomics equals more government regulation, more government spending. That makes things more expensive. That's the bottom line.""
Chip Roy, Texas Congressman: ""The Declaration of Economic Independence announced by @RonDeSantis is spot on. He knows we must fight for the American family collapsing under an economy that no longer works for them as quality of life & economic security diminish. #WeWinTheyLose (1/4) #EconomicIndependence""
Phil Cox: _""Biden economic policies have been an utter disaster for working families in this country. Governor DeSantis understands that. That's why he laid out a substantive forward-looking plan: take back our economy from China from an out-of-control administrative state in Washington, DC, and put it back where it belongs, which is in the hands of middle-class Americans. And the good news for Americans is that all you have to do is look to Florida. It has the number one economy of any state in the country, great schools, educational freedom, educational choice, surpluses, low debt ratio, things are working in Florida. That's why everyone who's moving there."" _
Hal Lambert: ""The Biden administration wants to move us to multiple electric vehicles to be the majority of the cars in this country, and 80% of the batteries are manufactured in China. We're going to be more dependent on China for what they're saying our energy needs are. It's insane. And not only that, Neil, they came out earlier this year and said, 'we're going to start opening Electric Vehicle battery facilities in the Congo. And that's the future.' I mean, they're not talking about moving them here, they're talking about moving them keeping them overseas. That's the kind of thinking that we need to switch from, we need to move back to the American people. And that's what Governor DeSantis wants to do.""
Tom Elliot: ""DeSantis has got this exactly right. To fix the tuition & student loan crisis, the feds need to be removed from the equation entirely (having access to Washington's money printer is why tuition is skyrocketing several x the rate of inflation)""
Dan Eberhart: ""His message about economic growth, about being a conservative without the baggage of Trump and his message about you know, what he's going to bring in terms of an energetic executive, that's pro America. I think is going to resonate very well with primary voters and with all voters in the general election and you're going to see him coalesce support.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla — Governor DeSantis yesterday did an interview with the Wall Street Journal on his new plan to reverse the decline of our nation's struggling economy and fight for the middle class by taking on the elites, DC bureaucrats, and Communist China. Read the full article below. Clips of the interview are also on the Wall Street Journal's podcast.
DeSantis Says He Will Weigh U.S. Ban of TikTok if Elected PresidentWall Street JournalAlex LearyJuly 31, 2023
Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis said if elected he would look at a national ban of TikTok, the popular video sharing app, citing a growing threat to the U.S. from China.
""I am inclined to not want TikTok in the United States,"" DeSantis told The Wall Street Journal in an interview following the release of his economic plan that identifies confronting Beijing as a priority. ""I think it's creating a security vulnerability for us. I think they are mining a lot of data.""
The Florida governor also said he would work to oust Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his post expires in 2026, adding to his continuing criticism of the Fed, and said he would support rules governing how the central bank sets interest rates.
On TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, DeSantis also cited the impact the service can have on children, calling it ""very very toxic."" But he stressed he wouldn't go as far as the Restrict Act, a bipartisan measure introduced in the Senate that would allow the president to take action against an array of foreign software and services from U.S. adversaries.
""At the end of the day I don't want big brother to be getting into everybody's apps,"" he said. ""It's about vulnerabilities to our country.""
It isn't clear whether the U.S. government actually could ban TikTok, which says it has roughly 150 million American users. Lawmakers in both parties see the app as a danger because of concerns that users' data could be transferred to the Chinese government.
In 2020, then-President Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok by executive order. Two federal judges expressed doubt that the president had the power to do so. The Biden administration withdrew Trump's order while continuing to scrutinize the app.
DeSantis also said he would support government aid for critical sectors, again in the context of growing competition with China, and he singled out national security. Congress last year carved out $52 billion for the semiconductor industry and research. ""I wouldn't get carried away,"" he said, saying the government didn't want to play venture capitalists with future technologies.
""But I do think in things that are a matter of national survival we can be thoughtful of how we're incentivizing these industries to be here in the United States.""
DeSantis is seeking to regain footing in the Republican presidential primary after stumbles that have eroded his status as the top challenger to former President Donald Trump. DeSantis has added a flurry of stops in early-voting states and has turned to releasing policy proposals.
The economic plan calls for:
Revoking China's permanent normal trade relations status.
Banning the import of Chinese goods made from stolen intellectual property.
Installing a new chair for the Fed, which is required by law to seek maximum employment and stable prices.
Restricting pension-fund managers from considering factors such as climate change in investment decisions.
Making universities responsible for student loans and allowing those loans to be discharged through bankruptcy.
The U.S.-China trade status is rooted in a 1999 U.S.-China pact struck when Beijing prepared to join the World Trade Organization, and it provides the most favorable trade terms and tariff rates. Trump levied tariffs on Chinese-made goods in an attempt to gain leverage, but his trade deals didn't stimulate U.S. manufacturing in their first few years.
DeSantis also would seek to bar companies from sharing critical technologies with China—which the Biden administration already has taken steps toward—and provide incentives for the repatriation of U.S. capital from China through tax abatements and other measures to secure the supply chain. Details of how he would see through such a move, and for many of his other proposals, weren't included in an overview of his plan.
""The Chinese Communist Party continues to eat this country's lunch every single day,"" said DeSantis, appearing before a crowd at a distribution warehouse. He tried to contrast between a free-market economy and one ""in which the rules are jiggered to be able to help incumbent companies.""
Sounding populist notes, DeSantis also assailed diversity and inclusion programs and called for a focus on vocational and apprenticeship education.
DeSantis has increasingly criticized the Fed and Powell, accusing the central bank of fueling inflation by printing trillions of dollars and saying it accepted Biden administration claims that price pressures were transitory. Interest-rate hikes, he has said, have hurt average Americans.
Last week, the Fed resumed interest-rate increases, bringing them to a 22-year high. Inflation has retreated from a 40-year high hit last summer, with the consumer-price index climbing 3% in June from a year earlier. That is well below the June 2022 peak of 9.1%, when gasoline prices reached a U.S. record average of $5 a gallon. Still, absent falling pump prices, core inflation remains at 4.8%
DeSantis will appoint a Fed chairman who will focus on maintaining a stable dollar, according to his proposal. ""The Fed must focus on stable prices; it is not a social engineer and cannot be allowed to be an unaccountable economic central planner,"" the plan says.
Trump nominated Powell, who was given a second term under President Biden.
DeSantis's plan also takes aim at the idea of a central bank digital currency, saying he would block such a proposal that would ""move us closer to a social credit system."" The Fed has explored the concept but said Congress would need to be involved.
DeSantis also would continue his attacks on so-called woke policies by saying he would strengthen rules and scrutiny of pension-fund managers who consider aspects such as climate change when making investment decisions. In March, Biden issued the first veto of his presidency by rejecting a Republican-led measure that would have overturned a regulation on environmental, social and corporate governance guidelines, or ESG.
DeSantis's plan, called the Declaration of Economic Independence, also follows longstanding conservative economic policy by cutting regulation and spending. He said he would push to mandate work requirements for welfare programs and enforce immigration law to protect U.S. workers.
The proposal also calls for working with the private sector to develop vocational training programs. DeSantis said he also would make universities responsible for student loans and seek to allow those loans to be discharged through bankruptcy. His campaign didn't provide details on how that would affect the existing system of federal student loans.
The Florida economy has done well generally, rebounding from Covid-19, but DeSantis has also faced criticism, including from Trump, for not doing enough to address soaring housing and insurance costs. In a recent tweet, Rep. Greg Steube (R., Fla.), a Trump ally, said the insurance problem was ""the result of the state's top elected official failing to focus on (and be present in) Florida. This is a major crisis for Floridians.""
Asked by a reporter why he didn't see those problems coming, DeSantis called it a ""false premise"" and pointed to attempts the state has taken on both fronts. He also pointed to what he called intense demand from people to move to Florida and said pandemic-related supply chain problems hindered new construction.

Ron DeSantis Unveils Declaration of Economic Independence
DeSantis vows to fight for the middle class and take on the elites, DC bureaucrats, and Communist China to put the American Dream back within reach
ROCHESTER, N.H. — Governor Ron DeSantis today unveiled his ""Declaration of Economic Independence"" at a New Hampshire manufacturing facility alongside local business owners and workers. DeSantis' detailed, 10-point plan will reverse the decline of our nation's struggling economy and fight for the middle class by taking on the elites, DC bureaucrats, and Communist China.
""We must be a society in which Americans who work hard and give the most of their God-given ability are able to succeed, to afford to buy a home, a car and to raise a family,"" Ron DeSantis said. ""My promise is that I will always fight for our citizens, our families, our future, and our way of life – and I will never back down. We will take back control of our destiny — and ensure that our future is as proud, independent, and free as our past.""
DeSantis' ""Declaration of Economic Independence"" has 10 key pillars.


Taking Back Control of our Economy from China and Restoring our Economic Sovereignty


Achieving 3% Growth by Incentivizing Investment, Eliminating Bureaucracy and Red Tape, and Keeping Taxes Low


Unleashing American Energy Independence


Ending Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and Political Engineering by Large Investors


Restoring Merit and Respect for the Individual as the Central Criteria for Economic Advancement


Reforming our Education System and Lowering Barriers to Entry for Working Class Americans


Creating a Fair Labor Market by Securing the Border and Enforcing our Laws


Reining in the Federal Reserve


Opposing Bailouts and Holding Bad Economic Actors Responsible


Fighting Reckless and Wasteful Federal Spending


This is the third major policy announcement DeSantis has made since launching his campaign. It follows the plan to stop the invasion and secure the border DeSantis unveiled last month in Texas and his plan he released in South Carolina for a mission first military. DeSantis has also discussed actions he would take to end the weaponization of the federal government.
RON DESANTIS' DECLARATION OF ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE PLAN
Taking Back Control of our Economy from China and Restoring our Economic Sovereignty
DeSantis will end our abusive relationship with the CCP, reverse our ever-increasing trade deficits, ban imports of goods made from stolen intellectual property, strengthen protections to stop child and forced labor, and end China's preferential trade status.
DeSantis will demand that American companies act in accordance with American interests — which means preventing companies from sharing critical technologies with China and banning the sale of strategic assets like farmland to CCP members and their affiliates.DeSantis will incentivize the repatriation of U.S. capital from China through strategic tax abatements and aligning market incentives with strategic goals to help secure our supply chains and invest in America.
Achieving 3% Growth by Incentivizing Investment, Eliminating Bureaucracy and Red Tape, and Keeping Taxes Low
DeSantis will advance an ambitious tax and regulatory reform agenda to unleash American production, increase productivity and growth, and support our families, workers, and small businesses while lowering inflation.
DeSantis will reverse Biden's job-crippling and ideological regulations and executive orders on Day One.
DeSantis will eliminate the fourth branch of government. The days of attempting to regulate the American economy into oblivion by ideological extremism will be done.DeSantis will work to not only extend the individual tax rates and further simplify the tax code, but also seek permanence.DeSantis will seek a more competitive tax system that incentivizes long-term, domestic investment over financial speculation and short-term returns while purging the code of K Street carveouts and loopholes.
DeSantis will seek to make permanent full immediate expensing, maintain territoriality, and further strengthen base erosion measures to ensure corporations are investing in America.DeSantis will use all available Article II authority to restore accountability in the executive branch, move agencies out of DC and slash the bureaucratic state, restrict foreign lobbying and post-employment revolving doors by former government officials, and ban individual stock trading by members of Congress and executive branch officials.
Unleashing American Energy Independence
DeSantis will unleash our domestic energy sector, modernize and protect our grid, and advance American energy independence. This will not only increase our economic and national security while reducing inflation, it will also help fuel a manufacturing renaissance that will create jobs, revitalize our communities, and improve our standard of living. We can no longer afford to tie one arm behind our economy's back by prioritizing the left's ideological agenda, crushing regulations, and endless permitting requirements.DeSantis will reverse the federal government's attempt to force people to buy electric vehicles. We will save the American automobile.
Ending Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and Political Engineering by Large Investors
DeSantis will not tolerate woke corporations using ESG as an end-run around our constitutional system to impose heavy-handed, left-wing edicts through concentrated private power. There will be no ideological litmus test for getting a loan, establishing a bank account, or running a business.
DeSantis will strengthen rules governing fiduciary responsibilities, transparency requirements, and scrutiny of firms that manage public pension funds.
Restoring Merit and Respect for the Individual as the Central Criteria for Economic Advancement
DeSantis will instruct the DOJ Civil Rights Division and relevant agencies to root out discrimination under the false guises of diversity, equity, and inclusion. ""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"" programs are racist, discriminatory, and obscure the fundamental truth that all men are created equal.
Reforming our Education System and Lowering Barriers to Entry for Working Class Americans
DeSantis will support school choice nationwide, protect parental rights, reform accreditation, and steer funding towards programs and institutions that support the jobs of the future. Our students will learn how to read, write, do math, and think critically instead of learning to hate our country. DeSantis will educate artisans and engineers instead of politicized administrators and bureaucrats, seeking to accelerate students along these career paths as early as possible.DeSantis will work with the private sector to accelerate and develop vocational and apprenticeship programs in anticipation of our great industrial revival, with a goal to become #1 in the world for skilled trades by 2030.DeSantis will no longer incentivize useless degrees and courses with blanket government loans. To that end, he will make universities, not taxpayers, responsible for the loans their students accrue. He will also seek to allow student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy like any other loan.
Creating a Fair Labor Market by Securing the Border and Enforcing our Laws
DeSantis will create a fair labor market by securing the border, enforcing our laws, eliminating chain migration and the diversity visa lottery, and limiting unskilled immigration.
DeSantis will make it a top priority of his administration to destroy the fentanyl market in America.
The American immigration system will serve Americans — not multinational corporate elites.
Reining in the Federal Reserve
DeSantis will appoint a Chairman of the Federal Reserve who will focus on maintaining a stable dollar instead of the political pressures of the day. The Fed must focus on stable prices; it is not a social engineer and cannot be allowed to be an unaccountable economic central planner.
DeSantis will ensure that the Federal Reserve does not implement a central bank digital currency to control the finances of hardworking Americans. DeSantis will block any attempts to establish a Central Bank Digital Currency or any other policies that will move us closer to a social credit system.
Where Washington has sought to regulate and inhibit innovation such as Bitcoin and other new technologies, DeSantis will protect entrepreneurship from central planners who seek to stifle what they cannot control.
Opposing Bailouts and Holding Bad Economic Actors Responsible
DeSantis will require ""clear language"" disclosures by banks and shadow banks to increase transparency and better track systemic risks.DeSantis will support community and regional banks that bolster the economic front lines of main street AmericaDeSantis will protect cryptocurrencies and work to end politically driven debanking and financial doxing.
In the event of an existential economic crisis, DeSantis will seek to strip those accountable of all golden parachutes and prevent the further accumulation of wealth to those already deemed too big to fail.
Fighting Reckless and Wasteful Federal Spending
DeSantis will be a new sheriff in town when it comes to spending, and he will not be afraid of using his veto pen. Our government programs as they exist today are wrought with waste, fraud, and abuse, and continue to be a major drag on our economy, our budget, and the flourishing of our citizens.DeSantis use his Article II authority to prohibit federal grants to entities that engage in active discrimination through DEI or other unconstitutional initiatives. He will no longer allow hardworking families and taxpayers to have their tax dollars flow to organizations that seek to undermine their values and beliefs.DeSantis will also mandate work requirements for welfare programs.

"Remarks Unveiling a ""Declaration of Economic Independence"" in Rochester, New Hampshire",2023-07-31T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/remarks-unveiling-declaration-economic-independence-rochester-new-hampshire,"
We appreciate everybody, for us to be able to advance a new direction to help America's economy. Our country is in decline right now. We see it with military decline and cultural decline, but we also see it in terms of economic decline.
I'm running for President because we cannot be satisfied with simply managing this decline a little bit better than the Democrats. I'm running for President because we need to reverse the decline of this country and restore our country to the greatness that it deserves. And that begins by restoring an American economy that actually works for American families again.
The reality is, have you seen over these many years, American families have been saddled with weak economic growth [and] high prices. Their quality of life has stagnated. We've seen our national debt explode, and the Chinese Communist Party continues to eat this country's lunch every single day. Economic policy needs to be focused on making the cost of living more affordable and the American dream more attainable for American working families. And if you don't get that right, you cannot be successful as a country. And we cannot allow the failed ruling class in this nation to dictate our nation's policies. We have to defeat those individuals and institutions that have caused our economic malaise.
We cannot have policy that cow towels to the largest corporations and Wall Street at the expense of small businesses and average Americans. There's a difference between a free market economy, which we want, and corporatism, in which the rules are jiggered to be able to help incumbent companies.
We also have to stop selling out this country's future to China. It is hurting our middle class and it is hurting our national security. We see for millions of Americans the American Dream slipping away. Costs of life's essentials have gone through the roof. Things like buying a home, purchasing a car, starting a family. Things that used to be the hallmark of the American Dream are now cost prohibitive for so many people throughout our country. Even getting groceries on a weekly basis has become a major challenge. Think about this. Today, the bottom half of households have less wealth than they did in 1989. Meanwhile, the top 10% have added $29 trillion in wealth.
COVID lockdowns accelerated that trend. It crippled the market share of small businesses and benefited the largest corporations. It diminished the purchasing power of our middle class and it up-ended our workforce such that millions of people left the workforce and still to this day have not returned. We now have 6 million or more prime-age men who are neither working nor looking for work at all. In 1953, the labor participation rate amongst that cohort was 98%. Today, it's 89%. And of course, we've seen mass illegal immigration undercut American jobs and wages, the rule of law and our very social fabric.
Meanwhile, Washington politicians have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on a broken university system which has churned out students deep in debt, and in positions where it's almost impossible for them to be successful and to start families. Deaths due to opioids, alcoholism and suicide have surged in this country, and depression and anxiety have risen even more due to recent lockdown COVID policies. Over the past decade, life expectancy in the United States has declined, and it's been declining for a number of years now.
This is not normal. This is not acceptable. And yet entrenched politicians in Washington refuse to change course. Why would they? Life for many of the people who are connected have never done better right now. Five of the eight wealthiest counties in the United States of America are suburbs of Washington DC. How does that happen? They're not producing anything of note other than a lot of debt and a lot of hot air. And yet there they go. Multinational corporations, particularly big tech companies have seen a massive surge in wealth while selling our assets and outsourcing our industrial base to China.
Since 2020, a handful of tech companies have increased their market capitalization by over $6 trillion. That's actually more than our entire nominal GDP has increased over that period of time. That is not a broad base, durable economy. So the elites in this country have failed time and time again. They've imposed policies that have proven short-sighted and are proven counterproductive.
Just look back a quarter of a century ago, with what we were told what happened with China. They said if you granted China special trading status and put them in the World Trade Organization, that China would become more democratic, that it would guard against forced transfers of technology, that you wouldn't have a mass relocation of American manufacturing to China, and that we would be safeguarded against surges of Chinese imports. What actually happened over these past 25 years, China has become more authoritarian, more powerful and more ambitious. We've seen our relationship marred by the theft of our intellectual property, trade dumping, currency manipulation, and espionage. Our industrial base here in the United States has hollowed out. We've developed a dangerous dependence on Chinese supply chains. And our companies have been exposed to a hostile security apparatus. The elites sold us a bill of goods when it came to China. They were wrong, and we need to get it right.
You also look at what happened in the aftermath of the Wall Street bailout in 2008. During the great financial crisis, those policies have proven very costly. To average Americans, when you have boom and bust cycles with monetary policies, the average person is the one that ends up holding the bag for that things like quantitative easing that became a mainstay of our monetary policy. It definitely made a wealthy people richer, but it neglected the middle class and they've not been able to get ahead. Meanwhile, large corporations have secured massive carve outs and bailouts. This has become a form of venture socialism in which gains are privatized at the top, whereas the losses are borne by you, the hardworking American taxpayer. And of course, when these companies mismanaged themselves, the leadership is able to avoid accountability for that mismanagement. So the idea of 'too big to fail' for big institutions has led to 'too difficult to succeed' for America's middle class.
And then more recently, the lockdowns imposed on COVID-19 and the associated borrowing, printing, and spending of money has proved to be disastrous. The COVID lockdowns and the associated policies represented the largest transfer of wealth from working people [and] small businesses to large corporations, like Apple and Amazon and Facebook, than we've ever seen in the modern history of our country. It would be great if all we needed to do to reach prosperity is just borrow, print and spend with no end in sight. If you could do that, then heck, let's just borrow another 10 30, 50 billion. Why not? Let's keep the party going. But we all know that is not how the world works. Ultimately, the bill becomes due. And the bill has become due in the form of average Americans paying exorbitant prices for the necessities of life.
What Congress did, what the feds did, they effectively imposed a tax increase a massive tax increase on Americans. It was an invisible tax increase. It was an indirect tax increase, but their policies precipitated a massive decline in purchasing power and lower standard of living for people all throughout this country. Now, more recently on COVID, Florida, we said no to all this, and we really led the way in dragging this country out of perpetual lockdown. We protected our people's ability to earn a living, our businesses' ability to operate, our kids' ability to be in school in person five days a week. We bucked the elites when we did that. No Governor faced more incoming fire during those periods of time than I did because we were standing out and saying we're going to do what's right. We are not going to simply subcontract out our leadership to people like Dr. Fauci. We refuse to let Florida descend into some type of Fauci-an dystopia where people's livelihoods were ruined, and their freedoms were curtailed. We fought for Floridians who were being ignored by the elites, whose livelihoods hung in the balance and who did not have a voice. We were their voice, and we were their fighter, and the results are that Florida continues to lead the way.
Our economy is ranked number one amongst all 50 states by CNBC. We're ranked number one in new business formations. Number one in economic growth amongst large states, and our economy has grown way more than the nation's as a whole. Since I've been governor, we've actually paid down 25% of our state's total debt, and we run budget surpluses every year. Of course, the folks in the Live Free or Die state can appreciate this, we don't have an income tax. Some of your New England brethren may want to try that sometime. We've been able to attract more wealth and investment into the state of Florida since I've been governor than has ever gone to a single state in the United States in our country's history over a single period of time.
We're ranked number one in education by US News and World Report. We've led the nation in net in migration every year since I've been governor, and our crime rate is at a 50 year low. So leadership matters. We showed how to get it done. We beat the elites. We showed the way forward to restore freedom and opportunity for people all throughout this country and I will fight as president for the American people just like we fought for the people of Florida. Now, revitalizing economic freedom and opportunity will require building an economy where the concerns of average citizens are elevated over those deemed too big to fail. We are today declaring our economic independence from the failed elites and policies that have harmed this nation's middle class.
We will re-shore, we will diversify, and we will expand our economy. We will reward hard work and ingenuity. We will usher in a new era of growth, prosperity and civic pride. We are a nation with an economy, not the other way around. We are citizens of a Republic. We are not cogs in a global economic empire.
We reject the technocratic management of American decline. We reject fostering dependency on welfare programs. We will reverse the decline of this country. We will restore our country to the greatness that it deserves.
We want to be a country that makes things again. We want to be a country where you can raise a family on one sole income. We want to be a family where we're both inspiring, but also demanding loyalty from our elites. We want to be a country where young people feel they can develop skills and values to be able to build productive and fulfilling lives.
So, we will declare our economic independence from the failed elites that have orchestrated American decline, from the reckless federal spending that has inflated prices and plunged this nation to the brink of bankruptcy. We will declare our economic independence from the Chinese Communist Party. We will declare our economic independence from the central planners who seek to advance their political agenda at the expense of the wellbeing of average Americans. We will seek economic independence from destructive policies like the Green New Deal that seek to kneecap our domestic energy production. We will seek independence from a class of progressive corporations looking out for every interest under the sun except the interests of the American people.
The goal of our Declaration of Independence is simple. We, the American people, win. They lose.
So here's what we have to do to get this right. First, we have to restore the economic sovereignty of this country and take back control of our economy from China. This abusive relationship, the asymmetric relationship between our two countries, must come to an end. No more massive trade deficits. No more importing of goods with stolen intellectual property. No more preferential trade status. We need to incentivize the repatriation of American capital and investment here in the United States so we can recapture our supply chains and build a strong, durable industrial base. And in Florida, we've actually taken action against the CCP, we have banned the purchase of land and Florida by members of the Chinese Communist Party or its affiliates.
Second thing we need to do, is we must achieve stronger economic growth. If you look at what's been the case over the past 10-15 years, growth has been substandard. We need to hit 3% or more. That's not only good for the economy, it's not only good for opportunity, standard of living, it'll also help us solve some of these budget problems, because we'll have a wider economic base. We are going to unleash American production, we're going to seek to increase productivity, and we will make sure our economic policies support families and small businesses. Bureaucracy and red tape are one of the leading drags on economic growth right now in our country. Not only does it inhibit our ability to grow, it gives a competitive advantage to the largest companies, because they can afford accountants and lawyers and navigate all that. It's the little guy, it's the budding entrepreneur, it's the small business, it's the medium-sized business who suffer the most at the hands of federal overreach. Biden's job crippling and ideological regulations and executive orders will be reversed by me on day one.
We showed how to do this in Florida. Not only has our economy in Florida grown much faster than the national average, our government footprint in Florida is the smallest per capita in the country in terms of our state workers, most of what's going on in DC is totally non-essential, and we need a major reduction in the bureaucracy that is impacting the American people.
We are also going to ensure that tax rates are low, that the tax code is simple, and that these policies are permanent, so that people are able to make decisions about how to deploy their resources. We want the full immediate expensing, we want territoriality, and we want to strengthen Base Erosion measures to ensure more investment in America.
We're proud in Florida to have the second lowest per capita tax and debt burden anywhere in the United States. Obviously, New Hampshire takes that very, very seriously. But we need to make sure that we are not killing businesses and opportunities with excessive regulation and excessive taxes.
Third thing we will do, we will achieve energy independence by using our domestic resources. The United States has the best oil and gas resources in the world, we have an incredible opportunity to leverage this competitive advantage for the good of our economy, for the good of the average citizen, because this will help drive down inflation and make things more affordable. It'll be good for our industrial base, but it will be good for our national security. We do not want to rely on hostile countries to meet this country's energy needs. We can do it ourselves, and we are going to reverse the policies of Biden that's trying to force Americans to buy electric vehicles. That's your choice if you want to do it. But I can tell you, most of the stuff that goes into those electric vehicles is made in China. Why would you want to knowingly make this country more dependent on what goes on in China? So we will make sure that we ditch those regs and we will save the American automobile in this country.
You're not going to have a strong economy if the economy is politicized. If companies feel like they have to take political positions on everything under the sun, so we're going to end the politicization of the economy by kneecapping things like ESG, they call it environment, social governance. The reality is, this is just a cover for people in large companies to depart from their obligations to their shareholders, and to use that financial power to advance an ideological or political agenda. It also represents an end run around our constitutional system, because what these companies are doing, especially when they collude to say, kneecap energy production, or people engaged in enforcing immigration laws, or people that may be involved in the firearm industry, they are doing or attempting to do through the economy, what they could never achieve at the ballot box. And it's an end run around the constitutional system where they're trying to change the policy of this country without we, the people, being able to hold them accountable at the ballot box. That is not the way you do this. So yes, as President, we're going to ensure that these businesses are actually meeting their fiduciary obligations to maximize value for shareholders or for beneficiaries. In Florida, we signed legislation nixing ESG from our pension fund, we nixed social credit scores in our banking industry, and we took $2 billion from our pension fund that was being managed by BlackRock, which is a big ESG company, and we took it away from them, because we don't want political agendas to interfere with the pensions of our teachers, our firefighters, and our police officers.
Fifth thing we will do is we will restore merit, and in the individual as the central criteria for economic advancement. The US Supreme Court recently issued a ruling on using race to determine who gets into college and who doesn't. That decision to nix that was correct. We got to judge people based on the content of their character not on the color of their skin. That ruling should apply across the board through our economy, and the so-called DEI programs that many corporations have embraced, those are discriminatory programs. If they have you go through a training and say somehow you have white privilege, that is wrong, that is judging somebody based on the color of their skin. And so we need to treat people as individuals, not as members of groups, and sometimes people will say things like DEI, think it's an ideological agenda, but even if you think some of these programs are well intentioned, my response to you would be to this: the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race, and that's what we're going to do in this country.
Sixth thing, we are going to reform the education system in this country, and we're going to lower barriers of entry, particularly for blue collar workers. We need our schools from K-12 through university to focus on education, not indoctrination. We need to make sure that the rights of parents that direct the education and upbringing of their children, that those rights are respected and honored, like we have in Florida, and we need universal school choice so that parents have the right to send their kid to a school that works for them and works for their family.
We've done all of that in Florida, we need to do it nationwide. We also have to champion workforce education and technical training. A degree from a four-year, brick and ivy university is one way you can be successful, but it's not the only way you can be successful. And for many people, it's not the best way to be successful. So let's elevate opportunities for our young people to acquire tangible skills that they can then parlay into very successful careers. In Florida, we've doubled the number of apprenticeships that we have. We have workforce education now in our middle schools, and we've taken programs like commercial driver's license, producing truck drivers, where we used to do 600 a year, now Florida's producing 3500 a year. And guess what? Those guys can make six figures in their first job coming out, no debt, no millstone around their neck, they have the ability to succeed, and a lot of these guys, when they get skills in electrical things, they may work for four or five years and then they can start their own business with that. And in a growing state like Florida, there's a lot of opportunities to service some of these new communities. So it's really good for our students, and it's just important as president, I'm just going to send the message you are not less worthy because you didn't get a degree from a four year university. It's good if you did, God bless you, but that's not the only way to do success, and we understand that.
It's also going to be good for our economy. Because if we are going to do like we want to, become more industrial, to have more manufacturing, yes, you got to have good tax, regulatory... you got to have all those policies in place, but you need to have the skilled workforce that can power the manufacturing of the future, this will help us get that done. And then I look to see what's happened with a lot of college students. When I was growing up people said, ""If you don't go to college, you can't be successful in this world."" I think a lot of that was well-intentioned, I think people just wanted you to be able to advance yourself. But the reality is, we've had a generation of students go deep into debt, and some of them ended up with degrees and things like zombie studies, which are just not making a difference, and unfortunately, some of them end up in jobs they could have had right out of high school anyways. We just have to reorient this to yes, if you go in debt, to get an engineering degree from MIT, you're going to be fine, you're going to be good. I'm not going to quibble with that, but a lot of these degrees have not given people a pathway to success, and it's caused them to be deep in debt.
So what are you going to do about that? It's wrong to say that a truck driver should have to pay off the debt of somebody who got a degree in gender studies. This is not the taxpayers that should have to do that. At the same time, I have sympathy for some of these students, because I think they were sold a bill of goods, I think these universities knew that they could take all this federal loan money, and if you're there for six years, hey, that's more money for them, and they do it and they increase their administrative bloat, and they didn't make the instruction any better. And so what do you do? Well, I think the university should be responsible for the student debt, you produce somebody that can be successful, they pay off the loans, great. If you don't, then you're going to be on the hook. That will cause a change in the type of course programs that a lot of these universities are offering. They're not going to afford to be doing ideological studies, because they know that's not going to lead to gainful employment. I also think student loans should be dischargeable in bankruptcy, why they're not and other debts are? And so we need to do things to make it better for our students to be able to have pathways for success, but it starts with holding these universities accountable and we will absolutely do that as President
Seven, we need a strong and fair labor market. We have to secure our border, we have to stop illegal immigration, we need to end things like chain migration and the diversity visa lottery. We should not have massive amounts of unskilled migration coming into this country. What we want is immigration that benefits the average American. We don't want to be bringing people in on programs to undercut wages of American citizens. And so that has got to be our touchstone: what is benefiting the American worker and what is benefiting the wages of the average American.
Eighth, we need to rein in the Federal Reserve. It is not designed or supposed to be an economic central planner. It is not supposed to be indulging in social justice, or social engineering. It's got one job: maintain stable prices. And it has departed from that with what it's done over the last many years. We're now in a situation where they've raised interest rates, because they put us in this, and so now affording a home [or] your mortgage payment is twice as much as what it would have been four or five years ago for basically the same home, given how much interest rates have gone up. So the Fed needs to have a limited role in this country. It's not accountable to the electorate, so the idea that it's going to take all this power, and that we're all just going to be its guinea pigs, that doesn't work and a republic or a constitutional system. So I will appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve who understands that, who understands the limited role that it has, and is going to focus on making sure the prices are stable for American businesses and consumers. We also will reject the Federal Reserve's attempt to impose a central bank digital currency on the American people.
Now, what the Fed has said is, 'well, we're going to consult with the legislature, we'll consult with the executive and ideally, we would get authorization from Congress,' I think is what they said. No, it's not ideal. You cannot do this unless Congress authorizes, [and] I don't think Congress would authorize it. I would certainly veto that if I were president. But why do they want this? They want to go to a cashless society. They want to eliminate cryptocurrency, and they want all the transactions to go through this central bank digital currency.
Now, why do they want to do that? Well China wants to do it, because they impose a social credit system on that. People at the World Economic Forum in Davos, you know, some of these elites, they've said if you have central bank digital currency, it allows elites to circumscribe purchases that they don't like, like ammunition, like energy, like all these different things. And so sometimes you have things that are proposed by policymakers that are kind of like a wolf in sheep's clothing, that it may look okay on the surface, but underneath it, you can see that it's a threat to liberty. Central Bank Digital Currency is not that. Central Bank Digital Currency is a wolf coming as a wolf. If you think that you can trust unaccountable elites to centrally plan our economy and have oversight over your economic decisions, and that's not going to end up being abused, then I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona I would like to sell you. So we see that this is a threat. In Florida, we've seen them talking about it, so I actually signed legislation where we don't recognize central bank digital currency. Now Congress could override us on that, but the Fed unilaterally, I don't think they could override us on that. So we've protected Floridians. But as President, on day one CBDC goes into the trash can. We're not going to allow it. We are going to let Americans invest in things like Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. No one's forcing you to do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. Biden's war on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency will come to an end when I become president.
Number nine, ensure that bad economic actors are held responsible for their decisions. No more socialism for the wealthy and rugged individualism for small businesses and for individuals. and for working class people. Part of having a good economy is that there can be cycles in the economy. People make bad decisions, there's a response, and then they do better next time. When elites get bailed out from their bad decisions, that really distorts how an economy is supposed to work. Of course, the people that are not politically connected get left holding the bag. If you think like a community bank here in New Hampshire would have been bailed out the way Silicon Valley Bank was, that's very politically connected, I got some more stuff to sell you if you believe that. We know that that's not the case, so we're not going to allow that to happen going forward.
And finally, number 10. We need to rein in Congress's spending habits. They are spending us into oblivion. I believe we need structural reforms, like a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and term limits for members of Congress. But I also think as a president, you've got to be willing to lean in and use the veto pen to be able to battle against this excessive spending. And our debt, even five or six years ago was like 20, 21 trillion. Now it's 32 trillion. Just in the last month or so they've added another trillion to our national debt, and it's all because Congress, it's easier for them to put it on the credit card than to actually have to make tough decisions. And so we're going to be a force against that. In Florida, we run big budget surpluses, we've paid down debt. I vetoed billions and billions of dollars of excessive spending since I've been governor to keep everything in line and to keep things going in a good direction. And we really haven't had a president since Ronald Reagan who leaned in against Congress overspending, and so I will be that president that will do that and will stand up for taxpayers and will stand up for the next generation.
So at the end of the day, economic policy is really not even as much about dollars and cents, obviously, it is. But the bigger question is, what kind of a country do we want to have? And I want a country where Americans that work hard, Americans that get the most out of their God-given ability, are able to get ahead in this country, they're able to raise a family, and they're able to lead fulfilling and productive lives. And if we can't get that right, then we are not going to succeed as a country. So that is going to be our focal point.
And I understand there's a lot of pessimism in the air about the direction of our country. We seem to have gone off the rails on so many different things. I think people want to see a restoration of sanity to this society. They want to see a restoration of normalcy to communities, and they're looking for that direction.
It can be done. Our decline is a choice. At the end of the day, we will make that choice over the next 18 months with our presidential election, but also, in other things that we do as Americans.
Success for this country is attainable. Freedom that we've been bequeathed by prior generations is worth fighting for. And we have everything we need to be successful.
We have the people, we have the natural resources, we have the ingenuity, and no matter how bad things get, we will always have that can-do American spirit. You can never kill it. It's always there. We just have to bring it to the to the surface. And we need the will to force Washington DC to once again work for the American people.
And my promise is this. As President, I'm not going to sit there like a wallflower. I am going to fight for our people. I am going to fight for our families, I am going to fight for our future, and I am gonna fight for our way of life. I will never back down. I will stand my ground. We will take back control of our national destiny, and we will ensure that this country enjoys a new birth of freedom. Thank you so much. God bless you all. Thank you.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - What They Are Saying: Ron DeSantis Wins the Day in Iowa,2023-07-30T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-what-they-are-saying-ron-desantis-wins-the-day-iowa,"
""Pure Fire."" ""Policy rich."" ""Fantastic."" ""Future of the GOP."" ""Absolutely rocked it.""
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis' work ethic was on full display after a busy and energetic swing through Iowa, which was noted by supporters, eventgoers, influential conservatives, and members of the media.
From his breakneck pace of events on a bus tour filled with interviews and media availabilities to his energetic speech at the Iowa GOP's Lincoln Dinner to staying late at his reception to have beers with the large number of supporters who came out to see him, the governor outworked the entire field in the Hawkeye State yesterday.
Another notable moment from the evening came when New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu stopped by DeSantis' reception for a brief chat following the governors' speech. DeSantis will be back in the Granite State on Sunday and will unveil his ""Declaration of Economic Independence"" economic policy there on Monday.
""The time for excuses is over. We must get the job done. I will get the job done… We're doing all 99 counties in Iowa because this caucus demands that you earn it,"" DeSantis said in his speech at the Iowa GOP's Lincoln Dinner last night. Watch his full speech here.
Multiple Iowa legislators praised DeSantis' speech.
Iowa State Senator Jeff Reichman: ""Last night's speech and the overwhelming standing ovation showed Iowans the man that will rise to the top. We spent four years of the Trump administration mired in investigations and impeachment trials, the last three years of Biden, with coverups and destroying the integrity of the agencies sworn to guard America. Not only will Gov. DeSantis carry on the policies that will bring back the America I swore an oath to defend, but DeSantis will restore dignity to the office.""
Iowa State Representative Bill Gustoff: ""The Lincoln Dinner showed that Republicans have a deep bench of great candidates for President in 2024 compared to the train wreck offered by Democrats. Iowans will have a difficult choice for caucusing, but Governor DeSantis knocked it out of the park in his short speech packed with a long list of plans to put the country back on track, complete with a record of accomplishment to show why he's the one to get the job done.""
Iowa State Representative Dan Gehlbach: ""Ron DeSantis had an awesome, energetic speech last night that offered a positive vision for the future. He's ready to get to work on Day One with specific plans for our country. DeSantis took the time to talk to every single person in the room after his speech at the Iowa GOP Dinner, far more than any other candidate I saw.""
More of What They Are Saying:
Sergeant Bluff, Iowa activist Nicole Cleveland: ""I was most impressed with Governor Ron DeSantis while attending the Lincoln Dinner last night. He set out a clear vision for America from 2024 and beyond. His love for our nation was undeniable and he has proven it as being the only veteran to be seeking our Nation's highest office. I can't wait to hear more as he travels our great state.""
Washington, Iowa activist Matt Wells: ""Ron DeSantis absolutely rocked it at the Iowa Lincoln Dinner tonight. Focused. Policy rich. Knows what time it is. #IowaForDeSantis #DeSantis2024 #NeverBackDown""
Nevada Mayor and Story County GOP Chair Brett Barker: ""The first volume alert on my Apple Watch from the crowd at the @IowaGOP Lincoln Dinner goes to Governor @RonDeSantis.""
Rep. Chip Roy: ""It's time for Americans to win again. #WinWithDeSantis #DeSanity""
Patrick Ruffini: ""Echoes of the 2007 JJ? Time will tell, but this and the fight with Kamala suggest DeSantis regaining his footing.""
NBC News' Gabe Gutierrez: ""@GovRonDeSantis gets strong reception at Lincoln Dinner, most enthusiastic so far.""
Chris Loesch: ""This is fantastic.""
SC Radio Host Tara Servatius: ""Pure fire. Listen. What DeSantis has did in Florida is why the state has flipped solid red for the first time in my adult lifetime and why the population center of the country has shifted to Florida/the south for the 1st time since the founding.""
John Stemberger: ""Amazing speech.""
The Blaze's Steve Deace: ""From a little birdie at the Lincoln Dinner in Iowa last night, who worked with Trump White House and is open to DeSantis but so far hasn't been impressed with his campaign (also knows Iowa well): ""DeSantis got a great spot getting to go after Asa. And then Scott was just so-so after him. A couple of folks, including Pence, got booed. Trump was flat and just talking off a script. DeSantis and Vivek had the most energy, and they had equal response in the after-party rooms to Trump. This was the first speech I've seen Ron properly parlay what he did in Florida to what he'll do in the future as president. He needs to do that more. It's the best I've seen DeSantis in the three of his events I've been to. Scott's polling is all a reflection of DeSantis not adequately messaging to evangelicals here. If he does that, he'll take over Scott's polling.""
NBC News' Fin Gomez: ""So far, DeSantis has received the loudest reaction from the Iowa Republicans at the IA GOP Lincoln dinner who have come to hear from the majority of the 2024 GOP field.""
John R. Lott Jr: ""Ron DeSantis gives an impassioned speech at the Iowa Lincoln Dinner. School Choice, Tough on Crime, #2A, Strong Border enforcement, Stood strong against those who wanted lockdowns, and much, much more #Election2024""
Politico's Natalie Allison: ""DeSantis stayed late tonight to greet supporters, and in general hustled around quite a bit the last two days in Iowa — including for the kind of humble retail politics stops that some political observers previously doubted he'd embrace. (i.e. a dozen vets today in a remote area)""
Dave Reaboi: ""Damn. I've never seen DeSantis so fired up, brimming with energy.""
CNN's Kit Maher: ""DeSantis at the Never Back Down reception room enjoys a Coors Light after taking photos with attendees, following speech at Iowa GOP dinner, says, ""We're gonna get it done.""

"Remarks at the Republican Party of Iowa's Annual Lincoln Dinner in in Des Moines, Iowa",2023-07-28T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/remarks-the-republican-party-iowas-annual-lincoln-dinner-des-moines-iowa,"
I am so proud to be an American. My granddaddy, who was born in 1921 in the Deep South, taught me two really important lessons about being an American. The first thing he taught me was that we kneel to the father in prayer. He taught me that James 5:16 says ""the prayers of the righteous avail much."" And even though we kneel to the father in prayer, he said, lesson number two is that we stand for the flag in respect. He said, ""our American flag is a symbol of freedom and liberty and justice for all."" These were powerful words from a man born, as I said, in the Deep South who understood a very different America. So when I moved into his home, when my parents divorced, when I was seven years old, we moved into his home, 700 square feet, a rental. He taught me very quickly, he said, ""son, you can be bitter or you can get better, but you can't be both."" These were valuable lessons and my mother helped so much. She was a lady who taught me because she works 16 hours a day as a nurse's aide, changing bed pans and rolling patients. She taught me that there is dignity in all work and that if you're able-bodied in America, you work. That's called America.
If you take out a loan, you pay it back. And if you commit a violent crime, you go to jail. And if God made you a man, you play sports against men.
These are simple common sense lessons of America. But Joe Biden and the radical Left, he is attacking the values that made us possible. He is tearing down every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. I was a kid trapped in poverty who did not believe that in America all things were possible. But because of the values of this nation, the kid who nearly flunked out of high school as a freshman, I failed four subjects, Spanish and English. When you fail Spanish and English, no one calls you bilingual. No, they call you by bi-ignorant. But I had a mentor who told me all things were possible. And so protecting the values of America is protecting the rungs on the ladder that allow the poorest, most vulnerable students in this nation to climb. We must protect our values. I'm running for president because I know America can do for anyone what she's done for me. Focusing on restoring hope, creating opportunities, and protecting the America we all love. To protect the America we all love, we must first start by backing the blue. Every law enforcement officer in this country deserves our respect and our admiration. You see the radical Left. They want to defund and demonize and demoralize the police. It's our responsibility to refund and rebuild local law enforcement. We must restore dignity and respect, but we also have to get tougher on violent criminals from carjackers to cop killers who should never see the light of day again.
And by doing so, we will allow grandmothers like the one that raised me not to be trapped in our house from the time the sun goes down until the time the sun comes up. But in order to protect America, we must also protect our southern border. We must build the wall. Finish it. 70,000 Americans have lost their lives to fentanyl. A good friend of mine in Charleston, a business school former Dean, Alan Shao, just this year, a few months ago, lost his son to fentanyl. Too many American families are being devastated by a drug whose precursors come from China, manufactured in Mexican labs, and then the cartels bring them across our unsafe, insecure, and wide open southern border. We deserve better. And as president of the United States, I'll use the power of the presidency to stop the cartels in their tracks. Without question, they must cease to exist on our side of the border.
But we must also close our southern border so that 6 million illegal immigrants under radical Joe Biden do not continue to cross our southern border. And that's before they ended Title 42, which could make it 10 million illegal immigrants crossing our borders. We deserve better. But also as commander in chief, I'll stand toe to toe with China and say, not on my watch, will you continue to spy on our kids, buy our farmlands, and steal our jobs in our supply chain. We will stop them and win this economic war by creating jobs in America, high tech, high manufacturing jobs, the marvel of the world. We have the power to get these things accomplished at home. Minerals, medicines, and microchips. Three specific areas that as president of the United States, I would focus the intellectual ability and the workforce to make sure that we create 10 million new American jobs and start creating the essentials at home, creating great jobs for Americans.
And finally, for any of this to happen, we have to win the cultural war here at home. The radical Left and Joe Biden has us as they continue to sell this drug of victimhood and the narcotic of despair leading to a culture of grievance in America. We have survived the most challenging times from a civil war to World War I, World War II, the Korean conflict, Vietnam era. But we must win this battle against the culture of grievance. And as president of the United States, I will make sure that the truth of my life continues to disprove the lies of the radical Left. This is the greatest country on God's green earth. I am living proof that all things are possible in God's country, and that as we hold on to his dear hand, we can remember that he is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above all that we ask or imagine. We can remember that all things are truly possible, but we must choose greatness over grievance, victory over victimhood, and we must protect this land of opportunity so it doesn't become, with the radical Left, the land of oppression. God bless America and God bless you.

"Remarks at the Republican Party of Iowa's Annual Lincoln Dinner in in Des Moines, Iowa",2023-07-28T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/remarks-the-republican-party-iowas-annual-lincoln-dinner-des-moines-iowa-0,"
Hello, Iowa! Are you ready to send Joe Biden back to his basement in Delaware on a permanent vacation? I can promise you this: in my White House, there will be no cocaine allowed in the White House. And look, my son's only five years old. So he's not going to be lining his pockets with money from foreign governments. So don't worry about that. It's great to be here. I want to thank Chairman Kauffman. I want to thank all the great legislators in the state of Iowa for their great work. And I want to commend your outstanding Governor Kim Reynolds for her leadership, leading this great state.
Our country is in decline and Joe Biden is the custodian of that decline. I'm running for President because we, as Republicans, cannot be content with simply managing the decline of our country a little bit better than the Democrats. We must reverse American decline. We must restore this country to greatness, and we must provide our country with a new birth of freedom. To do that, it requires vision, it requires courage, and it requires leadership. That's exactly what we did in the state of Florida. Everything I promised people I would do, we did. And we delivered more than what we promised. We expanded Second Amendment rights. We enacted the Heartbeat Bill, we cut taxes by $2.7 billion. We have paid down 25% of our state's debt. We have the number one rated economy in the country, number one in new business formations. We have eliminated critical race theory from our K-12 schools. We have enacted a Parent's Bill of Rights to protect the rights of parents. And we have held criminals accountable by enacting the death penalty for pedophiles, and our crime rate is at a 50-year low. And when it came time to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, we refused to let the state of Florida descend into some type of Fauci-an dystopia. We stood strong against the mob, against the left, against the bureaucracy. And we fought for our people's rights. We fought for their jobs, we fought to have our kids in school. And as a result, the state of Florida has never done better. We will deliver those results in Washington.
We will repeal Bidenomics so that middle class people actually have a chance to get ahead in this country again. We will stop the Congress from borrowing and spending this country into oblivion. We need a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution. We need term limits for members of Congress so that we can have a citizen legislature again. We will get the bureaucracy off the back of small businesses in this country. And I'm going to issue an order to all agencies in DC to reduce their DC footprint by at least 50%.
We reject policies like the Green New Deal. We will develop our own natural resources and we will be energy independent, because we don't want to help our enemies. I pledge to be the president to finally solve the issue of the southern border. We're sending the military to the border. Yes, we will build a border wall and we will use deadly force against the Mexican drug cartels because I'm sick of them poisoning our kids, I'm sick of them killing our citizens, and I'm sick of them trafficking people into this country. That ends on January 20th, 2025.
We will usher in a reckoning for those like Dr. Fauci, who perpetrated COVID-19 lock downs and mandate policies. Those policies were destructive for this country. They hurt people, they hurt our economy, and we still haven't fully recovered from it. You don't coddle bureaucrats like Dr. Fauci, you bring them in and you say, 'you are fired' and we are going to hold them accountable for what they did.
We are going to ensure that parents in this country have the fundamental right to direct the upbringing and well-being of their kids. Schools and systems are important, but they do not supersede the rights of parents. We want education in this country, not indoctrination in this country. We got it done in Florida and we need to get it done nationally.
And I got Kamala Harris coming down to Florida trying to create phony narratives because she understands: Florida has stood up to the left's agenda. We have beat the left's agenda in the state of Florida. And so she thinks she can come down and lie about what we're doing in the state of Florida. I'm not budging an inch. We are going to fight back against these people. And we are not letting them take over our schools any longer. We are going to get this right as a nation.
We will also end the weaponization of federal agencies like the FBI and the Department of Justice. On day one with me as president, you will have a new director of the FBI—long overdue.
You will see a housecleaning at the Department of Justice and we are personally going to hold them accountable. We are not going to allow them to target people like parents going to a school board meeting, pro-life demonstrators just speaking their mind or are targeting religious groups like observant Catholics. Weaponization ends on day one of our administration and we are going to re-constitutionalize this federal government once and for all.
I'm proud to be the only candidate running for president on either side of the aisle this year that's actually served in a war. I served in Iraq as a naval officer alongside Navy Seals in Fallujah and Ramadi and places like that. Not exactly Club Med, but it was duty that called.
And, you know, I had opportunities to do a lot of other things in my life, I was a blue collar kid, I worked minimum wage jobs, didn't necessarily have anything handed to me. But I put myself in a position to do well, but then 911 happened, all volunteer forces—I said I need to do my part. So we served. And when you wear the cloth of your country, you wear that American flag on your uniform, you serve beside fellow patriots, and you serve a mission greater than yourself. That's a noble calling. And I thank all the veterans in Iowa and throughout this country who have worn the uniform because at the end of the day, a veteran is somebody who at one point in their life has written a check payable to the United States of America for an amount up to and including that individuals life.
We have a situation now in this country where our recruiting into our military is at the lowest level since the end of the draft during the Vietnam War. And the reason why –and I have veterans coming up to me saying 'Governor, I don't know that I'd want my kids or grandkids to join today's military.' Why? Because they're indulging in social experimentation. They're pursuing political agendas, woke ideology, they've taken their eye off the ball. As commander in chief, on day one, we are going to rip the politics out of the military. We're going to end the woke agenda, and we are going to restore the military to mission first. And we are going to make people proud to serve again and join again. And that's going to make our country stronger.
So here's the thing. We're not getting a mulligan on 2024. We either win this election and make good on all the promises that we're making, or the Democrats are going to throw this country into a hole that's going to take us a generation to come out of.
I believe that decline is a choice. I believe success is attainable. And I know that freedom is worth fighting for. This is our chance in 2024 to send the Biden-Harris administration to the dustbin of history where it belongs.
We have to rise to the occasion. We have to fight the good fight. We have to finish the race. And we have to keep the faith. The time for excuses is over. We must get the job done. I will get the job done. God bless you all. Thank you so much.
We're doing all 99 counties in Iowa, because this caucus demands that you earn it, and you got to go meet the folks. So you'll see me everywhere. God bless you all. Thank you so much. Let's win in 2024.

ICYMI: Ron DeSantis Responds to Tim Scott's Criticism of Florida's Education Standards: ""The way you lead is to fight back against the lies.""
OSKALOOSA, Iowa.— At a meet and greet in Oskaloosa today, Governor DeSantis pushed back against Tim Scott's recent criticism:
Watch the clip HERE.
GOVERNOR DESANTIS: ""Part of the reason our country has struggled is because D.C. Republicans all too often accept false narratives, accept lies that are perpetrated by the Left. And to accept the lie that Kamala Harris has been perpetrating even when that has been debunked, that's not the way you do it. The way you lead is to fight back against the lies, is to speak the truth. So I'm here defending my state of Florida against false accusations and against lies. And we're going to continue to speak the truth.""

"Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Says NH Fentanyl Crisis Made in China, And U.S. Must Respond",2023-07-28T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-says-nh-fentanyl-crisis-made-china-and-us-must-respond,"
NH Journal by Mitchell Scacchi
During a roundtable on rising opioid addiction and death rates in Manchester Wednesday, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley took a hardline stance against China regarding fentanyl in the United States.
""We have to kick this where it starts. And that means you go to China and say, 'We will end all normal trade relations with you until you stop killing Americans.' We have to be that firm, we have to be that tough,"" said Haley, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination.
And she told WMUR-TV she would also include direct military action against the cartels in Mexico.
""You do that by having your special operations go and eliminate those cartels,"" Haley said. ""We have to get our military on the ground and treat those cartels like the terrorists that they are.""
Talking with faith-based and community leaders, including former state Rep. Victoria Sullivan and former Speaker Pro Tempore of the state House Kimberly Rice, Haley asked about the attendees' efforts to combat addiction in New Hampshire while also discussing her own personal experiences with the issue.
""My niece, when she was 16, had to have back surgery. She had been given some sort of heavy medication,"" Haley recalled. ""We spent the next 12 to 13 years, longer than that, watching her go from addiction to worse addiction to worse addiction to worse addiction. And we literally waited any day to get that call that she had died. By the grace of God, she is now clean.""
And, Haley added, many Granite Staters have had similar experiences.
""I look at New Hampshire; it's really been ground zero for addictions for a long time.""
The number of opioid overdose deaths peaked in the state in 2017 (at 490) before declining slightly in the following two years. But now the bad news is inching back up, hitting 486 drug overdose deaths in 2022, according to the state's chief medical examiner's office. That was an 11 percent jump from 2021, while the nation as a whole experienced a 0.5 percent increase.
entanyl was involved in more than 80 percent of those deaths last year.
Manchester and Nashua are bearing the brunt of the crisis. The latter saw a 16 percent spike in opioid-related deaths in May 2023, while Manchester hovered around last year's record-breaking numbers, according to American Medical Response (AMR).
A synthetic opioid that can be 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, fentanyl is the driving force behind the state's opioid epidemic. And Haley didn't mince words when condemning China for supplying the fentanyl that's been pouring into the United States. ""I will make sure as president, I will make sure as a candidate, everybody needs to know how dangerous China is.""
While China placed fentanyl under a controlled regulatory regime in 2019, it has done little to hinder the flow of the deadly narcotic. The country is still the primary source of fentanyl in the United States.
""Y'all are trying to fix what's on the ground, we gotta fix it from where it's coming from in the first place,"" Haley noted.
According to the Brookings Institute, ""Instead of finished fentanyl being shipped directly to the United States, most smuggling now occurs via Mexico. Mexican criminal groups source fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and increasingly pre-precursors from China, and then traffic finished fentanyl from Mexico to the United States.""
Chinese actors, especially those in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, play an important role in supporting Mexican distributors by both laundering money and violating regulations to source their operations.
""Don't think for a second China doesn't know what they're doing when they send it over,"" Haley told the roundtable. ""That's the issue. And what we saw was [Secretary of State Antony] Blinken went there and basically said, 'We're going to start having talks about fentanyl.' There's nothing to talk about. Let's be clear, we know who the culprit is. We know exactly what they're doing, we know exactly why they're doing it, we just need to act on that.""
Haley's comments come about a month after the U.S. Justice Department arrested eight executives and employees and charged four China-based chemical manufacturing companies ""with crimes related to fentanyl production, distribution, and sales resulting from precursor chemicals"" – the first such charges against China-based companies and nationals for fentanyl-related crimes.
Meanwhile, the problem has been intensifying at the U.S.-Mexico border. So far this year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has seized 21,846 pounds of fentanyl at the border – nearly 8,000 pounds more than it seized all of last year (14,104 pounds).
""We had enough fentanyl cross the border last year that would kill every single American,"" Haley said. ""The number one cause of death of adults 18 to 49: fentanyl.""
Ironically, Haley made her comments the same day Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. He told the committee the Biden policy at the border ""is working,"" a claim most Americans reject. A poll released in June found just 33 percent of Americans approve of the job President Joe Biden is doing controlling the borders, his lowest number ever.
Fentanyl is extremely lethal, even in small doses. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, just one kilogram is potent enough to kill 500,000 people. But while Haley is focused on dealing with China and the supply side of the issue on a national level, she also stressed the importance of local control in combating addiction.
""I think that a lot of what needs to happen at the national level is, rather than D.C. holding all this money and putting all these programs out, they need to pass it down to the states and reduce the size of government, and let the states handle it.""
Haley continued, ""Your addiction issues in New Hampshire are different than the addiction issues in South Carolina, which are different than every other state. You know best how to handle it. Places like this are exactly the way you do it.""
Highlighting the interconnectedness between addiction at home and confronting China abroad, Haley added, ""Addiction needs to be front of mind for every American….And how we're going to deal with China needs to be top of mind.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.- Governor DeSantis joined the Megyn Kelly Show in what she called ""the most robust exchange he's had since he declared his presidency."" Read the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On Kamala Harris' lies about Florida's education standards:
Well, the White House has been obsessed with us in Florida from the time they took office. Clearly, they view us as a threat, and so [they do] anything that they can do to try to be noticed. But I think in this case, people looked at it, and they think, because she was lying, and she was demagoguing it. I mean, this stuff was bedded. This was all public. People can do comments, everyone was praising what a thorough job they did, then all of a sudden, they cherry pick something, take it out of context, and then try to demagogue it. Because if you look at the entire standards, there is no way you can view those standards and not come to any other conclusion that they are very, very honest about the injustice of slavery. That is time and time again, you see through that. I think the thing that is instructive though, is you have Harris doing this in Biden's White House. Corporate media, you know, [are] they are really truth tellers, if they are not holding the powerful accountable? They would have pushed back on this. They would have said, wait a minute, that is such a big one, we have had Dr. Alan on to shoot it down. And instead, they try to concoct the narrative even further and push it. So, I think people like Harris do it because they know they can get away with it with a lot of our corporate press.
On Bidenomics:
Well, first of all, what what's the root of the high prices? The root is government. This is a government-induced inflation crisis starting in March of 2020, with the $2 trillion CARES Act, the FED printing money. December 20 had $2.2 trillion out the door for Biden when he came in. Biden did [the] American Rescue Plan, another &2 trillion. When you borrow, print, and spend trillions and trillions of dollars like that, you are going to get inflation. Milton Friedman said, 18 months after this happened, you're going to get it. And then you had the Federal Reserve. Not only did they print all this money, they said, 'Oh it's transitory. Don't worry about the inflation.' It started going. So now they've been jacking up interest rates because they got behind the ball. So now the average person...can't afford a new home. If you make the median income compared to the median home price with the interest rate early on, it does not work financially. It's harder to afford a car and of course, daily expenses like groceries. We have to rein in Congress's spending, which has caused this.
On combatting Biden's border crisis:
Day one I will declare it a national emergency. I'll mobilize all resources, including the military, to go over and stop the invasion. We're not going to entertain the bogus asylum claims. We are going to actually build a wall, because I do think that's important. But we're going to have both Border Patrol and the military authorized to use deadly force against the Mexican drug cartels who are infiltrating our country. I was actually down there and there were some weathered pieces of a wall there. I go, and it's big steel beams, and these guys are working on it with you - and they're like, 'well, the cartels cut through the wall and then they bring in drugs. And basically, Biden just lets it happen.' So for us what I've said [is], if you're doing that and you've got a backpack full of fentanyl on and you're trying to scurry in, it's going to be the last thing you do. You are going to end up stone cold dead, because I'm going to let our folks do their job. If you just do that a few times, you are going to see a major, major change. But here's the thing. Tens of thousands of people are dying in our country because of fentanyl overdose. You can't go to a community in this country without running into a mother who's lost a child, and we're just supposed to just shrug our shoulders and let that happen? We're going to lean in against the cartels in ways that other presidents have not been able to do. That is going to make an impact, but we cannot allow this poison to just keep coming into our country and killing our young people.
On bringing energy to the executive:
They used to kind of serve in their prime and then pass the baton to the next generation. I think this generation has not really been as willing to do that. One of the reasons I'm running in comparison to Biden, my God, we need energy in the executive. We need some vigor and vitality. And when I go in on day one... we will spit nails starting January 20th, 2025. It will be day, after day, after day. We are going to have all the executive orders written before we take office, all the legislation we want will be done. We will have thousands of appointees to send to the Senate for confirmation. We are not going to miss a beat. We are going to take advantage of every opportunity, but you got to be vigorous, you got to have energy to be able to do that. I think the American people are ready to say, okay, let's try the next generation.

Republican presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., took aim Thursday at the ""forces within Biden's DOJ"" that he said seek to protect the president and his family, suggesting that there may be individuals within the Justice Department that have been ""suppressing"" certain information.
""The only explanation for the sweetheart deal is forces within Biden's DOJ protecting his family. We've seen it time and time again – DOJ weaponized to hunt Republicans and protect Democrats. It's unAmerican and when I'm president we're going to clean house and start over,"" Scott said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""It shouldn't take years for evidence and information on Hunter Biden's transactions from drugs to guns to contracts to come to light unless there are forces within Biden's DOJ suppressing that information.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Focuses on Opioids and China in New Hampshire,2023-07-27T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-focuses-opioids-and-china-new-hampshire,"
NBC News by Greg Hyatt
MANCHESTER, N.H. — The opioid epidemic has been a hot topic on the campaign trail in New Hampshire for years. Now, Nikki Haley is combining it with one of the key focuses of her campaign: China.
Haley discussed the impact of fentanyl at length during a community discussion with the organization Freedom Movement in Manchester Wednesday afternoon. She said her time serving as ambassador to the United Nations in 2017 and 2018 allowed her to realize ""how dangerous China is.""
On the campaign trail, Haley has called for ending normal trade relations with China as a solution, arguing the U.S. needs to look at, ""the source"" of where fentanyl is coming from.
It's part of a broader campaign theme for Haley. She talks on the campaign trail about favoring a direct, confrontational approach with China on a number of issues, including but not limited to addressing the alleged source of fentanyl.
Ken Farnaso, a Haley spokesperson, said in a statement that Haley is ""China's worst nightmare"" and that New Hampshire families ""are reeling from the fentanyl crisis.""
Opioids have had a major impact on New Hampshire. According to 2022 data from the state's chief medical examiner, overdose deaths in New Hampshire rose 11 percent, to 486. Of that number, 410 involved fentanyl.
The leading New Hampshire county in deaths for 2022 was Hillsborough County, which is anchored by Manchester, the state's largest city.
Data from the National Institute of Health show that nationally, ""drug overdoes rose from 2019 to 2021 with more than 106,000 drug overdose deaths reported in 2021.""
Haley said at her Wednesday event that opioids need to be a priority discussion, saying, ""Addiction needs to be front of mind for every American."" She said resolving the crisis revolves around treating addiction as health care, educating youth about the perils of fentanyl's omnipresence and securing the southern border.
Wednesday's discussion wasn't her first event on the state's fentanyl crisis, according to Haley's campaign. Haley held a law enforcement roundtable with Hillsborough Sheriff Chris Connelly to discuss the fentanyl crisis and crime in New Hampshire.

Pence Campaign Press Release - Pence Releases the Pence Plan to Fight Inflation,2023-07-26T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-pence-releases-the-pence-plan-fight-inflation,"
Vice President Mike Pence today released his top economic policy priority to fight Joe Biden's inflation nightmare. The comprehensive four-part plan addresses Biden's bloated spending spree, failed economic policy, supply chain breakdowns, and foreign energy dependence. With prices up more than 16% and real wages down 3%, Vice President Pence will not rest until prices are lower and inflation is ended.
""Government cannot spend its way to prosperity, and yet Joe Biden is set on dismantling our once great economy and hurting families who can no longer afford food or find a good paying job,"" Vice President Mike Pence stated. ""My top economic priority will be to renew American prosperity by cutting wasteful government spending, restoring the value of the dollar, building resilient supply chains, and restoring American energy independence.""
From day one, President Pence will bring skyrocketing prices back to earth with common-sense policies:

Stop record-breaking government spending that is driving inflation;
Reinstate a sound money policy and stabilize wildly fluctuating interest rates;
Bring manufacturing and production supply chains back home to reduce costs; and
Produce cheap, abundant American made energy to power our economy.

The Pence Plan to Fight Inflation will:
1. Stop the Government's Deficit Spending SpreeThe federal government has been overspending for decades, and it's only gotten worse under Biden. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, Biden's unprecedented spending spree has sent inflation through the roof. The Pence Administration will end runaway deficits by freezing non-defense spending, eliminating unnecessary government programs, repealing over $3 trillion in new spending under Biden, and reforming mandatory programs that drive our debt.
2. End the Dual Mandate and Stabilize Interest RatesThe Federal Reserve's monetary policy has increased the money supply by $5 trillion since 2020 and resulted in wildly unstable interest rates. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money for things like cars and homes, while destroying the value of every dollar Americans earn. It is time to bring stability to interest rates. We must end the Fed's dual mandate and make stable interest rates its sole focus as the country winds down monetary stimulus.
3. Bring Supply Chains Back Home to AmericaGlobal backlogs have driven up prices since the pandemic. We need to reduce the supply chain costs associated with shipping products from overseas by boosting manufacturing here in the United States. The Pence Administration will create the conditions to bring production back to this country by removing regulatory burdens, enacting pro-growth tax policies, and ensuring access to abundant American energy. We will fight inflation by making America the best place to do business again.
4. Restore American Energy Independence Since Biden took office, the price of electricity to power our homes has increased by 25%. Gas has gone up 60%. These higher prices for energy are passed on to consumers and increase the cost for every product that is grown on a farm, built in a factory, or shipped on a truck. It is time to reverse Biden's attack on American energy by restarting oil and gas leasing on federal lands, opening the Arctic and offshore regions for exploration, approving safe transportation of oil and gas, mining rare earth minerals, and rejecting climate change hysteria that is causing U.S. energy production to fall.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Governor DeSantis joined Clay Travis on Outkick: The Show. Read the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On Kamala Harris' fake narrative about Florida's education standards:
""Obviously she's lying, but you know that there is going to be corporate press that are going to run with that and try to create a narrative. There's actually been some that have pushed back because it's so egregious. When we got rid of critical race theory a couple years ago, in the bill that we did, we said you must teach accurate history, you must teach about racial discrimination, you must teach about all aspects of African American history, because we believe in true history. The left and the media at the time was saying, Florida doesn't want to have any African American history. The standards were developed [by] black history scholars...It's very, very thorough. And it [includes] every little aspect, not just slavery, but the black experience in America, from colonial times to beginning. No one can read those and think somehow that they are shilling. It's ridiculous. Everybody knows that. But she said that there wasn't going to be any black history, and now they're saying that somehow this is not accurate. And the reality is, they're lying, and they're creating an narrative. But you actually had some of these guys go on TV. One of them is an African American scholar. And he [said] everything we did here is factual. It's truthful. We are not doing an agenda. We're just telling the truth. And I think the reason why Harris and Biden and the left in the media react is because they see [what] we're doing in Florida. We've kneecapped their ability to use American history to advance their modern-day agenda. That is not the appropriate use of history. So now they're saying there is a provision in there that says somehow this [slavery] was good. That's not what it says. What it says was there were slaves that developed skills, which they did, but that was in spite of slavery. It wasn't because of slavery. And then they used those skills postbellum to be able to provide for themselves and their families. And so this scholar who's been on TV, he said, ""that's my history, I'm not going to let Kamala Harris erase my history."" _
On de-weaponizing the DOJ:
""What this shows with the whistleblower is that this weaponization of these agencies, on the one hand, there's parents going to school board meetings in Virginia, [they] sic the FBI on them. That's clearly an abuse [and] weaponization. But the flip side of that is, when you're connected to the ruling class, the DC ruling class, you get away scot-free with stuff. So many things should have launched a really serious inquiry. You're going to go guns a blazing on some of these offenses against people you don't like, like a massive investigation. And this? Did you even send a subpoena out? Did you ever even go to a grand jury? It's kind of like with Hillary. One of the things that bothered me with Hillary was not just the decision, which I disagree with. Comey said no reasonable prosecutor. That's not true. They never impaneled a grand jury. They never did a search warrant. They let Hillary's staffers look at the emails. And so the weaponization is, [if] they don't like you, they'll get you for jaywalking, but the flip side is, if you're on the team, you get out of jail free."" _
**On why he's running for president: **
""At the end of the day, I'm running for president to beat Biden. I'm reliable, I reflect the values of our voters and I will deliver on all this stuff. I've shown the ability to do that in Florida. Doing number two, it just doesn't appeal to me and I don't think I would be good at it. And I think I'm probably more valuable doing other things. You know, some people run for President because they want a cabinet position or VP or TV contributorship. I'm not that. I don't want VP, I don't want cabinet, I don't want to be a contributor. I'm running to win. That's the only reason I'm running, so we'll either do it or not."" _

On VP Kamala Harris' fake narrative about Florida's education curriculum:
""Well, she hopped on that plane very quickly on Friday to come down to Florida to spew this hoax. She wasn't going down to the border to actually do the job there to secure it. She wasn't working on all the cities that are decaying because of Soros-backed prosecutors. She's not worried about the military running low on ammo and weapons stocks. No, she's here to try to push a fake narrative about what Florida did. The interesting thing about this is, Florida eliminated critical race theory from our K-12 schools. We've got to stop indoctrinating kids in this country, and we can't be teaching them to hate America. But in that bill, we were accused of not wanting to teach African American history. [The bill] actually required that that be done, including talking about racial discrimination, and these standards really were born out of that. These are very thorough standards done by African American history scholars. There is no agenda here. It is just the truth. And they talk in gory detail a lot of the bad in American history, including, of course, the injustice of slavery. But she is trying to perpetuate a hoax, and I know they're using it to attack me because Biden's administration and Harris have been attacking me since they got in office and they [are] always attacking Florida, but they're really impugning the work of people like Dr. Allen, who were not involved politically, were just trying to do a good job and produce really robust standards."" _

Background:

Also, in June 2023, The Florida Police Benevolent Association (PBA) announced their endorsement of Ron DeSantis for President.
Florida PBA President John Kazanjian said:
""In major cities and communities across America, many Americans are grappling with increased crime rates that not only jeopardize public safety, but also threaten the quality of life in their communities. The ideological experiment of defunding the police and scapegoating law enforcement for America's social problems has failed. Now more than ever, Americans must elect the one candidate for president who has a proven track record in enhancing public safety and investing in the essential men and women who help maintain public safety every day. For the over 30,000 men and women in the Florida Police Benevolent Association, the choice for us could not be clearer. Governor Ron DeSantis and his administration have made Florida a law-and-order state, by investing in and supporting the thousands of law enforcement officers, who serve on the front lines in keeping our communities safe and secure. From investing over $100 million dollars to increase the salaries of state law enforcement officers to recruiting the best men and women across the country to join our ranks, to investing $20 million to local law enforcement agencies to support their battle against the Fentanyl epidemic, to toughening the penalties for major crimes, Governor DeSantis has made Florida a destination for all Americans to live safely and freely. He is one of the most effective Governors in the nation and he will take his proven track record to the White House, where he will continue to have the backs of law enforcement officers and make public safety a top priority. For these reasons, the Florida PBA is proud to endorse our Governor, Ron DeSantis, for President of the United States and we will do all that we can to help him prevail.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley to Discuss China and Fentanyl Crisis in New Hampshire,2023-07-21T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-discuss-china-and-fentanyl-crisis-new-hampshire,"
Washington Examiner by Misty Severi
Republican presidential contender and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will discuss China and the fentanyl crisis at a gathering in New Hampshire next week.
Haley, who has made the fentanyl crisis and China's ties to the crisis an important part of her campaign in New Hampshire, is making a swing through the northern state next week, which will also include two town halls. The event will be on July 26 in Manchester, New Hampshire, and will be a joint conversation on the crisis between Haley, former Republican state Rep. Victoria Sullivan, and Freedom Movement New Hampshire.
""Many New Hampshire families are reeling from the fentanyl crisis and Joe Biden's refusal to crack down on China,"" Ken Farnaso, a spokesman for Haley, told the Washington Examiner. ""Nikki Haley is China's worst nightmare, and Xi Jinping knows it. We look forward to working with the Freedom Movement New Hampshire next week to talk about Nikki's plan to stop the flow of fentanyl.""
New Hampshire is experiencing a growing trend of fatal drug overdoses, which caused more than 400 deaths in the state in 2022. In 2019, approximately 80% of fatal overdoses in New Hampshire included fentanyl, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The former governor unveiled a plan in April to stop the flow of fentanyl if she's elected president next year, which included ending relations with the Chinese government until it stops its part in the crisis and securing the United States's southern border with Mexico.
Chemicals for fentanyl and other drugs are supplied by China, which gives them to Mexico, which mass produces liquid fentanyl and fentanyl powder that's mixed into fake prescription drugs, Haley said. But China claims the chemicals used are common chemicals often sold through normal trade.
""In international trade, it is the importer's duty to prevent such chemicals from falling into the hands of illicit drugmakers,"" the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement last month. ""As China and the rest of the world strengthen control of fentanyl-related substances, the fentanyl issue in the U.S. has been deteriorating and taking away even more lives. The U.S. needs to do some serious reflections on this.""
Haley was the first presidential candidate to visit the border and rode along with Border Patrol to see the drug crisis firsthand. Her visit occurred in April.
The South Carolinian has hosted events on fentanyl in New Hampshire before, including a roundtable with Hillsborough County Sheriff Chris Connelly that focused on the drug crisis and crime in the state. Her swing through New Hampshire next week will also include two town halls, one in Barrington and the other in Hollis. Both will take place on July 25.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - In the News: Washington Examiner: Florida does not teach students that slavery was good,2023-07-21T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-the-news-washington-examiner-florida-does-not-teach,"
Washington Examiner: Florida does not teach students that slavery was goodHudson CrozierJuly 20, 2023Washington Examiner
Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has done a lot to scale back the Left's outsize influence over education. To rile up resistance, activists, politicians, and the media have spread almost every falsehood imaginable about what his anti-woke education policies actually do.
Those same forces have mobilized against Florida's new standards for history courses, which they accuse of ""whitewashing"" the truth about slavery and racism. It's hard to keep up with the deluge of flat-out lies they are relying on.
Critics claim the curriculum portrays slavery as ""beneficial"" to black people. The word ""beneficial,"" however, does not appear anywhere in the document in relation to slavery. Their issue is with one sentence that reads, ""Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.""
The guidelines do not, by any stretch of the imagination, describe slavery as a positive thing. They emphasize the brutal ""conditions"" of slaves, how ""an enslaved person"" was treated as ""property with no rights,"" and how slavery was at odds with ""founding principles of liberty, justice and equality."" Including facts about what slaves did to help themselves in these circumstances does not change that. It's simply a relevant part of the history of slaves.
Another controversial passage reads, ""Instruction includes acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans but is not limited to 1906 Atlanta Race Riot, 1919 Washington, D.C. Race Riot, 1920 Ocoee Massacre, 1921 Tulsa Massacre and the 1923 Rosewood Massacre.""
This ""suggests that the [Ocoee] massacre was sparked by violence from African Americans,"" said Florida Democratic state Sen. Geraldine Thompson. ""That's blaming the victim."" Journalists have explained what white people did to ignite the deadly race riot as if to debunk the guidelines.
But the sentence is not assessing the blame in any of the particular Jim Crow-era events listed. When discussing incidents of racial violence, such as the four mentioned, the state wants teachers to include any known details about violence committed by both groups. Are we supposed to believe that whites were never among the casualties? Again, these are just relevant, neutral pieces of information.
The local newspaper Florida Phoenix was so caught up in the narrative that it misquoted the standards as saying ""violence perpetrated by African Americans,"" leaving out the ""against."" At publishing time, it has not bothered to correct the error in its incredibly misleading article.
Liberal activist Genesis Robinson even claimed that Florida's secession from the Union during the Civil War is not mentioned in the curriculum. Once again, the easiest way to defend it is to quote its exact words: ""Describe Florida's involvement (secession, blockades of ports, the battles of Ft. Pickens, Olustee, Ft. Brooke, Natural Bridge, food supply) in the Civil War"" (emphasis mine).
And what fake racial controversy would be complete without melodrama from the NAACP?
""Today's actions by the Florida state government are an attempt to bring our country back to a 19th century America where Black life was not valued, nor our rights protected,"" NAACP President Derrick Johnson wailed.
I appreciate Johnson for articulating the pure paranoia driving this entire ""whitewashing"" hoax. Many on the Left are desperate to prove that conservatives want to erase history, desensitize the next generation to the evils of racism, and ultimately reintroduce discriminatory systems and the subjugation of blacks. It's one of the most difficult conspiracy theories to defend, so when they cannot find evidence for it, they make things up.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Rips AOC Over Israel Resolution Snub: 'You Would Fit Great with the Anti-Semites' at UN,2023-07-21T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-rips-aoc-over-israel-resolution-snub-you-would-fit,"
New York Post by Ryan King
Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley blistered Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) Thursday after the ""Squad"" member voted against a House resolution supporting Israel earlier this week.
""Why does Israel get under your skin? Because it's democratic, pro-American, or Jewish? You don't get worked up about massive human rights violations in China, Iran, Cuba, & Venezuela,"" Haley tweeted.
""You all would fit in great with the anti-Semites at the United Nations.""
Haley took an initial shot at the Bronx and Queens lawmaker shortly after she and eight other House Democrats voted against a resolution that stated Congress believes ""the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state;"" ""Congress rejects all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia;"" and ""the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel.""
The former South Carolina governor and US Ambassador to the UN posted the names of all nine ""nay"" votes Tuesday and vowed: ""We will remember this vote.""
""Oooh, a list!"" Ocasio-Cortez exclaimed in response on Twitter. ""Remember to call it 'People in Congress who think apartheid is wrong' or alternatively, 'People in Congress who don't ignore human rights abuses against Palestinians.'""
Other Democrats who joined AOC in opposing the resolution included Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), Summer Lee (D-Pa.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.) Andre Carson (D-Ind.), Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.).
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who triggered the resolution by declaring Israel to be a ""racist state"" this past weekend, voted ""yea"" on the resolution.
Haley has long been a staunch supporter of Israel and ardently defended the Jewish state during her tenure at Turtle Bay.
Ocasio-Cortez, by contrast, has been an outspoken critic of Israel, particularly the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Monday, Haley called for the censure of Ocasio-Cortez and her progressive peers following Jayapal's comment.
""[Biden] has AOC and the Squad in his party,"" Haley said during a speech at the Christians United for Israel conference. ""And just this week, a leading Democrat called Israel a 'racist state.'""
""The Democratic Party is the definition of extreme,"" she added. ""It's time to censure the Squad and get anti-Semitism out of America – for good!""

""I'm running for President because I want to reverse the decline of our country, I want to give this country a new birth of freedom. And together, we're going to be able to get that done.

That is not a recipe for success for people to realize the American dream... We also need to ensure that we're not empowering the Chinese Communist Party with our economic policies. I want American jobs, American business, and American industry. I don't want it all going over to China... My message is this: The decline of this country is not inevitable. It is a choice. It is a choice we will make. I'm going to win the White House because we are going to reverse this decline: economic decline, military decline, cultural decline. All of these things can be remedied, but we have got to get after it right now, and we cannot give up 2024.""
""Florida has one of the lowest unemployment rates, one of the best economies, and is one of the fastest growing states in the nation, and I believe that's why Governor DeSantis needs to be President of the United States,"" said Utah Senate President Stuart Adams.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis joined Hugh Hewitt on the Hugh Hewitt Show. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On the meaning behind his ""Mission First"" military policy:
""We just rolled out a policy about getting rid of the wokeness in the military and getting it focused back on the mission. I'm relying on my experience of being in an organization where at that time, it was mission first, and you checked a lot of this political stuff at the door; you try to get over any differences people have and unite to be for a common purpose. That's just how I always thought it was. I think that's how most veterans think it was. Now, with the recruiting crisis, there's a lot of people that, understandably, aren't signing up because they say, 'the military has lost its way.""
On being the only veteran in the race:
""We were in Al Anbar Province, places like Fallujah and Ramadi; this is Al Qaeda in Iraq during the troop surge of 2007. I think it began maybe [in] late 2006. I was there in 2007. And from a military perspective, it was a very successful operations. I mean, these guys were routed out; you started to have US forces work constructively with the Sunni Arab tribes. By the time we left, I mean, it was basically peaceful. I would say 99% of the casualties that the American troops were taking at that time were not in Al Anbar Province, they were in the Shia-dominated areas, where you had Iranian militias that were killing US troops with things like ESP devices, and so that was a success. The issue was trying to cobble together a democracy in that part of the world, which was something that was really beyond the military's capability to do. So, I came away from that having confidence that if you give us a concrete mission as an American military and show you know that we have the means to achieve it, our guys will execute that. We're not going to be able to socially engineer societies around the globe, and that was something that was readily apparent to me from being there. So, I'm very sensitive. If there's ever US troops involved, I just want to make sure that that mission is very clearly defined, and that we'll know that we can accomplish it, and we'll know when we accomplish it. I think we get into trouble when we get into situations where the mission is a little murky, where we don't necessarily know when we have a victory. And of course, if you look at the last two decades, we haven't had clear-cut victories in the conflicts that we've been engaged in.""
On whether Sen. Tuberville should reverse his position on military promotion holds:
""The military's policy is not following U.S. law. They are using tax dollars [and] they are funding abortion tourism, which is not an appropriate thing for the military to be doing. So, I think our Republicans in Congress should just take a stand on this. The DoD should stand down. We have all these other problems in our military, you know, we need more ammunition. We need more recruiting. We need all these other things and yet they're focusing on abortion tourism, so that'll be an easy thing for me day one as Commander in Chief, that policy will go out the window and we're going to focus on mission accomplishment.""
On combating the Chinese Communist Party:
""I think Xi is the most ideological Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. I think he has more global ambitions than any Chinese leader in our lifetime. They have built up a very powerful military, not at our level yet, but they're getting there. They're investing in things like artificial intelligence with their defense weapons, so I think that they have designed to not just on Taiwan, throughout the entire Indo-Pacific. And of course, as we've seen, even in our own hemisphere here. So, we're now in a situation as a country where I don't think the Biden administration has responded appropriately to that threat. I think that they view the Chinese as kind of a friendly competition. They've been more deferential lately, that ultimately is not going to work. Ultimately, what XI respects and what the CCP respects is hard power. So, we need to marshal more hard power in the Indo-Pacific. One of the things that we'll do is- and I think you can do this, and you know, all this stuff, through budget reconciliation, given what Biden did. I think you can do a multi-year a naval build-up, started in that first year in office, because ultimately, that's what we're going to need to do to project that type of power, we need to deny China the ability to dominate the Indo-Pacific.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis joined Mark Levin on The Mark Levin Show. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On confronting the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party:
""Biden's people, they think China is just like a friendly competition. No, it's not. China's looking to dominate the world. They are, to our generation, what the Soviet Union represented to the post World War II generation. They're the foremost geopolitical threat that this country faces. And they're the most formidable adversary we faced since the Soviet Union. In some respects, it's a more, it's a bigger challenge than the Soviets, at least in this respect. China's strength has been built off American policy empowering them economically over many decades. There was a decision made to grant them most favored nation trade status, put them in the World Trade Organization. Corporate America has subcontracted out so much to China, and they've gotten rich in corporate America. It hasn't been good for our country. It's been very, very good for China. So, the economic integration that we have, we never had that with the Soviet Union. The dependency of our country on the Communist Chinese economy for key things that matter, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, all these things, puts us in a very precarious situation. So yes, we need more hard power in the Pacific. At the end of the day, what Xi respects is he respects strength, and if we're projecting strength, working with our allies, they're going to respect that. We have got to declare independence from them economically, because that is what's fueling this military buildup. This is a problem that's been created by American elites who took their eye off the ball. They may have gotten rich off this, but it has not been good for our country.""
How he curbed CCP influence in Florida as governor:
""Part of countering China is yes, military, economic independence and then recognizing their cultural influence. So in Florida, for example, we eliminated Confucius Institutes from universities. They're not allowed in Florida. That's what the CCP will use to spew propaganda. We also prohibited land purchases by the CCP in the state of Florida; farmland, land near military bases, the whole nine yards, done. We need to do that stuff nationwide, because China's smart, they infiltrate and they exert a lot of influence over our society, I think, in ways that the Soviet Union was never able to do even at the height of the Cold War.""
On restoring the military to serve its core function:
""We're at a generational low in recruiting. We're at the lowest level since the draft ended after the Vietnam War. And the reason is- I think there's a number of reasons, but one of the reasons is the military has lost its way. They're indulging in social experimentation, political ideology, a woke agenda, that's taking the mission off of the core function of the military and focusing on all these extraneous things. I'm a Navy veteran, as you mentioned, and I've seen the Navy use drag queens to recruit. We've seen all these different examples of what's going on at the service academies, and what's going on in different services, and morale is low, they've driven a lot of warriors off. And we just can't be in a situation where we're going to be able to counter the threat from China if we're elevating social experimentation over mission accomplishment. When we have things like drag queens for recruiting in the military, China is laughing at us. They know that that's a sign of American weakness. And so all this stuff with DEI, all these other things, we're going to rip it out on day one, we're going to return the military to serve its core function. There's a difference between military life and military leadership, and civilian life and civilian leadership. Right now, what they're trying to do is they're trying to make the military be a reflection of how Goldman Sachs would operate, or consultant firm, or things like that. That is not what you want. You want the military to have a different set of values that are distinct from civilian society, and you want to be able to promote people based on merit and based on whether they're actually moving the ball forward. Right now, you may be able to be a one star just based on merit. But to get that second, third and fourth star, if you don't toe the political line, you will simply not advance in today's military. I don't think General Patton could probably make it past colonel in today's military.""

When you look at your children and they don't know...they have no idea what mama went through. As a matter of fact, when I was going through six rounds of chemotherapy, six weeks of radiation, and three surgeries, I couldn't really use my left arm. A lot of times, I told them I just hurt my arm, because they didn't want to tell them. But through God's grace, I'm here. And this guy [Ron DeSantis] helped me more than you will ever realize.""
On the Mamas for DeSantis Initiative:
Governor DeSantis: ""I think at the end of the day, she's just a very genuine person. She really believes in this country. She really cares about the country's future, because our three young kids are six, five and three. When she does things like rally mothers, like she did throughout the state of Florida, and grandmothers, since it is Florida, we want to include them, and now she's doing it around the country. It's because a lot of the issues that these parents are facing, we're facing. We're in the same boat. We're very sympathetic to that. And so, she is somebody that is very, very strong on the rights of parents and the well-being of children.""
First Lady Casey DeSantis: ""We feel that if we can do something to change the trajectory, and indeed preserve our American Republic, and we can take one for the team by getting hit on behalf of the people of this country- we're going to do it. We're going to fight for your family, we're going to fight for our family, and we're going to fight for America going forward.""
Governor DeSantis on the importance of participating in presidential debates:
""Oh, I think we'll do well either way. I mean, I think he owes it to people to participate. Nobody is entitled to be nominated. You've got to earn it. You gotta earn everything in this world. So, I think you show up. I think you participate. I think you make your case. And I think you answer questions. So, we're going to be doing that, regardless of who else shows up. Yeah, I think he ought to participate.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis joined Mark Levin on The Mark Levin Show. The highlights are below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On confronting the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party:
""Biden's people, they think China is just like a friendly competition. No, it's not. China's looking to dominate the world. They are, to our generation, what the Soviet Union represented to the post World War II generation. They're the foremost geopolitical threat that this country faces. And they're the most formidable adversary we faced since the Soviet Union. In some respects, it's a more, it's a bigger challenge than the Soviets, at least in this respect. China's strength has been built off American policy empowering them economically over many decades. There was a decision made to grant them most favored nation trade status, put them in the World Trade Organization. Corporate America has subcontracted out so much to China, and they've gotten rich in corporate America. It hasn't been good for our country. It's been very, very good for China. So, the economic integration that we have, we never had that with the Soviet Union. The dependency of our country on the Communist Chinese economy for key things that matter, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, all these things, puts us in a very precarious situation. So yes, we need more hard power in the Pacific. At the end of the day, what Xi respects is he respects strength, and if we're projecting strength, working with our allies, they're going to respect that. We have got to declare independence from them economically, because that is what's fueling this military buildup. This is a problem that's been created by American elites who took their eye off the ball. They may have gotten rich off this, but it has not been good for our country.""
How he curbed CCP influence in Florida as governor:
""Part of countering China is yes, military, economic independence and then recognizing their cultural influence. So in Florida, for example, we eliminated Confucius Institutes from universities. They're not allowed in Florida. That's what the CCP will use to spew propaganda. We also prohibited land purchases by the CCP in the state of Florida; farmland, land near military bases, the whole nine yards, done. We need to do that stuff nationwide, because China's smart, they infiltrate and they exert a lot of influence over our society, I think, in ways that the Soviet Union was never able to do even at the height of the Cold War.""
On restoring the military to serve its core function:
""We're at a generational low in recruiting. We're at the lowest level since the draft ended after the Vietnam War. And the reason is- I think there's a number of reasons, but one of the reasons is the military has lost its way. They're indulging in social experimentation, political ideology, a woke agenda, that's taking the mission off of the core function of the military and focusing on all these extraneous things. I'm a Navy veteran, as you mentioned, and I've seen the Navy use drag queens to recruit. We've seen all these different examples of what's going on at the service academies, and what's going on in different services, and morale is low, they've driven a lot of warriors off. And we just can't be in a situation where we're going to be able to counter the threat from China if we're elevating social experimentation over mission accomplishment. When we have things like drag queens for recruiting in the military, China is laughing at us. They know that that's a sign of American weakness. And so all this stuff with DEI, all these other things, we're going to rip it out on day one, we're going to return the military to serve its core function. There's a difference between military life and military leadership, and civilian life and civilian leadership. Right now, what they're trying to do is they're trying to make the military be a reflection of how Goldman Sachs would operate, or consultant firm, or things like that. That is not what you want. You want the military to have a different set of values that are distinct from civilian society, and you want to be able to promote people based on merit and based on whether they're actually moving the ball forward. Right now, you may be able to be a one star just based on merit. But to get that second, third and fourth star, if you don't toe the political line, you will simply not advance in today's military. I don't think General Patton could probably make it past colonel in today's military.""

Burgum Campaign Press Release - Doug Burgum Surpasses RNC Donor Threshold for Debate,2023-07-19T00:00:00+00:00,Doug Burgum,/documents/burgum-campaign-press-release-doug-burgum-surpasses-rnc-donor-threshold-for-debate,"
Follows New Hampshire Poll Showing Burgum Tied for 4th
Doug Burgum announced today that he has exceeded the donor requirements set forth by the Republican National Committee to qualify for the first debate.
Burgum has received over 40,000 individual donations including more than 200 from 20 different states. Burgum achieved these metrics six weeks after announcing his campaign despite having never held or run for national office before.
""Doug Burgum is well on his way to appearing on the debate stage after meeting the donor threshold and surging in New Hampshire,"" said campaign spokesman Lance Trover. ""Voters know America needs a governor and business leader like Doug to fix the economy, unleash American energy and win the Cold War with China.""
Burgum met the donor requirements the day after the University of New Hampshire released a poll showing the governor and business leader moving up to 4th place in the state and earning the support of 6 percent of voters. The poll found Burgum placing ahead of Mike Pence, Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, all of whom either entered the race well before Burgum or with much higher name recognition.

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Governor DeSantis in Columbia, S.C.",2023-07-18T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-governor-desantis-columbia-sc,"
""I have heard it on the ground in every one of my visits to South Carolina since entering this race — Joe Biden is failing the people of this state.""
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Today, Governor DeSantis visited Columbia, South Carolina, to register as a candidate in the presidential primary and to unveil his policy to restore our military.
Governor DeSantis started the morning at the South Carolina Republican Party headquarters, where he filed paperwork to officially enter the Republican presidential primary in South Carolina, making him the first GOP candidate to file in any state. Governor DeSantis was joined by South Carolina leaders State Senator Josh Kimbrell, State Representative Chris Murphy, and South Carolina GOP Chair Drew McKissick.
""I have heard it on the ground in every one of my visits to South Carolina since entering this race — Joe Biden is failing the people of this state,"" Governor DeSantis said. ""I'm excited to be the first Republican candidate to file candidacy paperwork in South Carolina as we continue our mission to reverse American decline by rejecting Bidenomics, stopping the invasion at the border, combatting communist China, and ensuring a better future for our children. Help is on the way.""
He then sat down with pastors for a discussion of issues such as protecting religious liberty and parents' rights.
Later in the day, Governor DeSantis held a press conference in Columbia, S.C. where he unveiled his plan for a ""Mission First Military."" This was the governor's second policy announcement of the campaign, following the plan he released last month to stop the invasion and secure the border.
""There was no greater honor than knowing I was wearing the cloth of my country when I served in the military, but our nation's once-proud fighting force has been infected and paralyzed by a political agenda."" Governor Ron DeSantis said. ""It is time to rip the woke out of the military and return it to its core mission. We must restore a sense of confidence, conviction, and patriotic duty to our institutions — and that begins with our military.""

Governor DeSantis ended the day with an interview on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper, where he talked about his new plan for a mission first military.
Watch a clip from the interview HERE.
On the problem with military recruiting:
""Why do we have the worst recruiting that we've had since the Vietnam conflict? Why have great warriors been driven off, such as with the COVID-19 shot mandates? These are people that had been performing admirably. A lot of them had COVID, they had natural immunity, they were told to take this shot or leave. I think you've had a big problem with morale [and] you clearly have a problem with recruiting. And at these levels, everybody has acknowledged these recruiting levels are at a crisis. Why is that the case? I think it's because people see the military losing its way, not focusing on the mission, and focusing on a lot of these other things, which we see that in other aspects of society as well. People want to join the military because they think it's something different. And I think some of the civilian leaders in the military are trying to have the military mimic corporate American academia. That's ultimately not going to work.""
On wokeness in the military:
""A lot of people who railed against wokeness can't even define it, so I think it's a sense of, you know, this is not something that's holding true to the core martial values that make the military unique. And I can tell you, the veterans, you don't have to look far and wide. Go to a VFW hall, go to an American Legion. There's huge amount of concern about the direction that the military is going in. And here's the thing, things like DEI and all that stuff, it hasn't worked in other aspects of society. It very well may be on the constitutional chopping block in light of the Supreme Court's decision on racial discrimination in higher education. And so it's not a model that I think is going to be successful in the military. So we're going to do what has been successful in the past, [and] I think you're going to see better recruiting as a result.""

""It is time to rip the woke out of the military and return it to its core mission."" - Governor Ron DeSantis
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Governor Ron DeSantis today released a detailed plan to restore America's military and make it mission-focused once again. The governor announced the proposal during an event with voters and residents in Columbia, South Carolina.
""There was no greater honor than knowing I was wearing the cloth of my country when I served in the military, but our nation's once-proud fighting force has been infected and paralyzed by a political agenda."" Governor Ron DeSantis said. ""It is time to rip the woke out of the military and return it to its core mission. We must restore a sense of confidence, conviction, and patriotic duty to our institutions — and that begins with our military.""
DeSantis' plan features four key pillars:

Ripping Political Agendas Out of Our Military
Restoring Military Standards
Breaking the Swamp & Promoting Accountability
Turning the Tide Against Biden's Military Recruitment Crisis?

DeSantis volunteered to join the Navy after graduating from Harvard Law School where he deployed in support of SEAL Team One as a JAG officer in Iraq and was awarded the Bronze Star.
This is the second major policy proposal Governor DeSantis has announced since launching his campaign. It follows the plan to stop the invasion and secure the border that DeSantis unveiled last month. He would be the first veteran president to serve in a war to be elected since 1988.
Ron DeSantis' Plan for a ""Mission First"" Military
Rip Political Agendas Out of Our MilitaryI. Eliminate ""Diverse-aucrats"" (Diversity Bureaucrats)

Get rid of Diversity and Inclusion administrators for each military department and end all DEI hirings.
End Military Departmental task forces, working groups, advisory boards, and other panels that focus on DEI. (For example, Task Force One Navy, Army Project Inclusion, and DOD Racial Disparity Reviews)
Task and hold accountable a Secretary of Defense who will elevate and consider generals, upper tiers of Pentagon flag officers, and military civilian leadership whose focus will be on lethality, readiness, and capabilities.

II. End Woke Operating Policies

End drag shows on military bases.??
Prohibit the Department of Defense from conducting business with advertising with left-wing firms that blacklist conservative news sources.
Revoke Executive Order 14004, which allows transgender personnel to serve in the military in their preferred sex and provides taxpayer funds for sex change hormones and surgeries, which cause issues with readiness.
Close the ""Defense Equity Team,"" and the ""Defense Advisory Commission on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.""
Prohibit Department of Defense contracts to Federally Funded Research and Development Corporations related to DEI until their policy changes.
Reform the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness to focus on the critical challenges facing the military such as recruiting, retention, and healthcare.

III. Ban Woke Indoctrination

Defund and prohibit any courses associated with Critical Race Theory at service academies.
Require that fields of study at service academies be in fields traceable to military needs such as military history, leadership, nuclear engineering, personnel management, or software development. Because the U.S. taxpayer is fully underwriting the cost of this education, the list of available academic disciplines should be narrowly focused on the needs of the Department of Defense.
Prohibit the instruction or propagation of theories such as Critical Race Theory (CRT) as part of military training.
No government building should raise any flag except the U.S. and military flags (except flags from foreign countries for official events, POW/MIA flag).
Ban woke recruitment content and the use of military social media accounts for activist content. Stop social media accounts of military accounts from posting on topics or issues that are not within their mission or are not recruitment messages.
Study the role of social media on military servicemen and Department of Defense civilian workforce.
Expand school choice and parental rights for families with children in Department of Defense schools.
Establish a ""Merit, Fairness, and Equality (MFE) Task Force"" to review the curriculums of the service academies and training in the military.
The entire Professional Military Education (PME) system produces substandard quality education. A critical first 100-days priority must be repealing the accreditation requirement for PME programs and to launch an immediate study to reforge all schools into competitive, rigorous, focused schools of operational and strategic excellence. Warfighting and lethality must be the overriding ethos of Professional Military Education and only the best should be allowed to graduate.

IV. Focus Veteran Benefits on Supporting Veterans, Not a Social Agenda

End equity plans that prioritize certain veterans for benefits over others based on their race.

Restore Military StandardsI. Recognize Differences Between Men and Women. Eliminate Racial Preferences in the Military. One Standard of Readiness.

Require all military services to have physical qualifications according to gender neutral standards.
Require statistical data transparency for performance and end any equity initiatives related to standards and readiness.
Ban race and gender quotas in military recruiting and promotions and mandate personnel decisions including accession, assignment, selection, and promotion based on merit.
Establish Department of Defense service standards based on readiness. Select the best applicants regardless of identity categories, rather than engaging in racial preferencing policies.
Oppose any efforts to draft our daughters.
Investigate any commander suspected of using racial or gender preferences in promotions.

II. Reinstate Un-Vaccinated Servicemen

Disallow the Pentagon from punishing troops based solely on their Covid-19 vaccination status, and allow troops who were kicked out for refusing the vaccine to reenter service with a changed reason for discharge and reinstatement to their prior rank from before they received punishment for their Covid-19 vaccination status.
Back pay active-duty members basic pay rates for time they missed as a result of punishment (discharged, separated, retired, or reassigned) for not receiving the Covid-19 vaccination.

III. Prioritizing Lethality, Readiness, and Capabilities, Not Ideology and Climate Change

The Department of Defense should never prioritize climate politics over national security and any environmental projects should require a cost–benefit analysis that prioritizes national security needs.
End activist climate change programs and focus on national security needs at-large.
End the requirement for Department of Defense contractors to track and slow their greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of readiness.
Stop EV funding that was initiated because of climate change activism rather than military readiness.
Stop funding programs for environmental justice.

III. Stop the Weaponization of Tools Intended to Root Out Legitimate Threats to Good Order and Discipline

Maintain a proper enforcement of a Uniform Code of Military Justice and end the costly Biden Administration's Department of Defense Countering Extremism Working Group.

Break the Swamp & Promote Accountability

Enforce Article 88 (Contempt Toward Officials) of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice which courts have found applies to retired generals and admirals. Any service member may be prosecuted for ""contemptuous words against the President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Security, or the Governor or legislature of any State, Commonwealth, or possession in which he is on duty or present.""
Cease issuing security clearances to retired Department of Defense senior leadership that go on network and cable news shows and who, as paid analysts, monetize and politicize their access to so-called ""inside information."" This should include removing security clearances from the 51 individuals who signed on to the Hunter Biden laptop ""disinformation"" letter in October 2020.
Institute a cooling off period for Pentagon top officials both before and after their tenure from serving as?military?contractor board members and lobbyists. These officials are leveraging their Pentagon and security positions before and after they serve as civilians.?
Issue an executive order to fire immediately any high-ranking?military?or intelligence official who knowingly lies under oath to a federal official or Congress. No longer will there be zero consequences and lack of accountability.
Fire immediately any joint chiefs officer who contacts an enemy counterpart without the knowledge of the president and overrides the authority of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.?
Within 6 months, the performance of all personnel in 4-star command and staff billets will be reviewed. Anyone determined to have promoted policies to the detriment of readiness and warfighting will be asked to resign or otherwise be removed from those positions. Similar reviews will be conducted over a longer time horizon for 3-star command and equivalent civilian SES positions.

Turn the Tide Against Biden's Military Recruitment Crisis
I. Restore National Pride in Our Military

Use the ""Bully Pulpit"" to engage all Americans on the power and meaning of its all-volunteer fighting force and a meaningful, purpose-driven military force that will have the resources, backing of their Commander-in-Chief, and the American people to defend the Constitution and the United States.
Develop a program for schools to teach that our military is and has been a force for justice and good in the world.
Order the Department of Defense to collaborate with external organizations to encourage open expression of honest views on perceptions and morale from potential recruits, voluntary military departures, and current personnel. Special focus will be given to addressing the perception of politicization within the military. Currently, there is a significant lack of available data in this regard, and the existing data is exclusively controlled by the executive branch. To rectify this, a public disclosure of the problem's nature is necessary, allowing my administration to identify and correct any mistakes. This transparency will play a vital role in rebuilding trust and confidence among servicemembers, their families, and the broader American public.

II. Expand Recruitment Programming

Expand JROTC programs and civics programs in secondary schools.
Work with the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition to promote military recruitment.
Allow military families to request the creation of educational savings accounts for their children.

Statement by Governor Asa Hutchinson on News of Donald Trump Being a Target of the January 6th Investigation,2023-07-18T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/statement-governor-asa-hutchinson-news-donald-trump-being-target-the-january-6th,"
WASHINGTON — The Asa for America campaign released the following statement today in regard to the news that Special Prosecutor Jack Smith has notified Donald Trump that he is a target of the January 6th investigation. This statement can be attributed to Governor Asa Hutchinson:
""I have said from the beginning that Donald Trump's actions on January 6 should disqualify him from ever being President again. As a former federal prosecutor, I understand the severity of Grand Jury investigations and what it means to be targeted by such an investigation. Donald Trump has confirmed that he is a target of this investigation and will likely be indicted once again. While Donald Trump would like the American people to believe that he is the victim in this situation, the truth is that the real victims of January 6th were our democracy, our rule of law, and those Capitol Police officers who worked valiantly to protect our Capitol. Anyone who truly loves this country and is willing to put the country over themselves would suspend their campaign for President of the United States immediately. It is disappointing that Donald Trump refuses to do so."" — Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the 46th Governor of Arkansas and a current Republican candidate for President

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Slams Biden: 'Acting Just Like Obama Did When it Comes to Netanyahu',2023-07-18T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-slams-biden-acting-just-like-obama-did-when-it-comes,"
Jewish News Syndicate by Mike Wagenheim
Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, took to the stage on Monday evening at the annual Christians United for Israel (CUFI) Summit in Washington. The former governor of South Carolina played to an adoring, pro-Israel crowd as a darling of its movement.
Haley, who trails well behind former President Donald Trump in polls very early in the presidential primary cycle, spoke with reporters before assuming the stage. She seemed prepped for a foreign-policy debate, covering an array of issues from China to Russia and, of course, Israel.
Haley dug into U.S. President Joe Biden for his slow-rolled invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit the White House, which Biden only extended in a phone call on Monday—more than six months after Netanyahu was re-elected.
""It's about time. I mean, look how long it's taken here,"" Haley told reporters. ""You have a friend and ally that shares the same values. We share the same enemies. And yet you refuse to ask him to come for the longest time.""
""Now, suddenly, you want to talk to him. I mean, it's Joe Biden. He's acting just like Obama did when it comes to Netanyahu,"" Haley continued. ""Now you see him wanting to criticize the judicial reforms in Israel. He needs to stay out of it.""
The Biden administration is ""very preachy to Israel,"" and the president ""always wants to talk down, like they should listen to us,"" Haley said.
She intimated that Biden is missing the forest for the trees. When Israel is safe and strong, the United States is safer, she said. ""We need to start treating them like the ally that they are.""
'Antisemitism is hate'
Haley also rapped congressional Democratic leaders for failing to take to task a handful of hard-left House members who are boycotting Israeli President Isaac Herzog's speech to Congress on Wednesday. The boycotters, in part, have claimed that Israel is racist.
""Antisemitism is hate. Antisemitism needs to be treated exactly like racism,"" Haley said. ""It used to be that Republicans and Democrats were both pro-Israel. It used to be that Republicans and Democrats both defied racism. But you're not seeing that anymore.""
She equated a lack of action on this issue with a de facto endorsement of the progressives' behavior.
""The Democratic Party owes us an answer on this,"" Haley said. ""They cannot continue to spew this hate. Not when antisemitism is hitting the levels that it is today.""
""We should never tolerate it, and they always treat antisemitism differently than racism. They shouldn't,"" Haley said. ""It's just as evil, and they need to start calling it out.""
The same goes for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) calling to account Republicans who take part in antisemitic activity, according to Haley.
According to polls, Trump maintains a very solid lead in the Republican primary in a crowded, diverse field. But the former president's legal woes and what many view as negative baggage could make for a volatile campaign, potentially allowing another candidate to break through.
Of the value of her pro-Israel bona fides to the Democratic-leaning American Jewish electorate in a general election, Haley said he hopes that ""everyone will remember what a good friend I was to Israel, and realize that I've never let up on that.""
""I will continue to be the most pro-Israel candidate that is running for president,"" she stated.
Being pro-Israel isn't about political expediency to Haley, the candidate said.
""I believe it,"" she said. ""In my heart, I know it's the right thing to do. I know that we need to make sure that they never think anything less of the United States but as their absolute best friend, and I will ensure that that happens.""
A media analysis of Haley's donors shows high levels of giving from prominent Jews, and her inner-campaign circle features several Jews. JNS asked Haley why Jewish donors have flocked to her, and why she surrounds herself with so many Jewish consultants.
""I would like to think they trust me,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, that's what you want, is for people to trust you. You want them to feel like they know exactly what to expect from you. With the Jewish people, I've always fought really hard in support of the pro-Israel community.""
She added that she would ""like to think that they just feel like this is a strong bond and relationship. And I hope that they'll continue to strengthen. And I hope they know that I'm going to continue to fight for the things they care about.""
'All they've done is tried to weaken sanctions'
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has failed to launch an investigation into the origins of drones, with which Russia is attacking Ukrainian civilians. The United States and other Western allies, including the three European signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, say the evidence points to the drones being manufactured and supplied by Iran, in violation of the accord.
JNS asked Haley to comment on the lack of investigation from the global body—a familiar target of hers.
""The United Nations refuses to acknowledge Iran for being the terrorists that they are,"" Haley said. ""This regime was not following resolutions when I was there. This regime continues to export oil with the help of Biden. This regime continues to fund and fuel terrorists. This regime continues to work on building a nuclear bomb.""
Meanwhile, she said, U.N. leadership remains silent on the issue.
""That's the reason Iran has gotten away with so much. All they've done is tried to weaken sanctions with the help of Joe Biden, weaken how much is said to Iran with the help of Joe Biden, and now, Joe Biden wants to further chat with Iran,"" she said.
""You can't work with people who say 'Death to America. Death to Israel,'"" she said. ""It doesn't make any sense.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Calls for Censure of the 'Squad' Following Israel Comments,2023-07-18T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-calls-for-censure-the-squad-following-israel,"
Washington Examiner by Brady Knox and Conrad Hoyt
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley called for the censure of the ""Squad"" following a series of ""anti-Israel"" comments.
In a speech at the Christians United for Israel conference on Monday, Haley lambasted the Biden administration's alleged abandonment and mistreatment of Israel but took particular aim at the group of progressive congresswomen who have made several comments directly critical of Israel.
""Biden has AOC and the Squad in his party,"" Haley said. ""And just this week, a leading Democrat called Israel a 'racist state.'""
""The Democratic Party is the definition of extreme,"" she continued. ""It's time to censure the Squad and get antisemitism out of America — for good!""
The former United Nations ambassador contrasted the Squad's treatment of Israel with her own during her tenure, pledging to continue that support if she is elected president next year.
House Democrats have come under fire recently for comments viewed as being against Israel. This past Saturday, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), a member of the Squad, compared Israel to Russia, likening the ""occupation and displacement"" Ukrainians face due to Russia's invasion to that of those in Palestine.
Around the same time, comments from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) perhaps caused an even bigger stir. Jayapal told protesters at a conference in Chicago that she wanted to let them know, ""We have been fighting to make it clear that Israel is a racist state.""
While not a member of the Squad, Jayapal is the chairwoman of the House Progressive Caucus and thus often aligned with Omar and other members of the group, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Jayapal later apologized for her comments, saying, ""Words do matter and so it is important that I clarify my statement. I do not believe the idea of Israel as a nation is racist.""
The Democrats' comments came just days before Israeli President Isaac Herzog is set to address Congress in a joint session on Wednesday. At least four House Democrats have said they'll skip the event, including Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush (D-MO), and Jamaal Bowman (D-NY).
In advance of Herzog's address, House Republicans are set to force a vote on a resolution affirming congressional support for Israel, wanting Democrats to go on the record as the party remains split on the issue of support for the country.
Haley's speech thus came at a most opportune time, and she made sure to target President Joe Biden as well for his treatment of the Middle Eastern country.
The presidential hopeful said Biden's policy regarding Israel was a continuation of that of the Obama administration and has weakened the United States on the world stage.
""For the sake of America and for Israel, we need to make Joe Biden a one-term president,"" Haley said. ""We need a leader who advances peace in the Middle East.""
She gave high praise to Israel throughout her speech, portraying the country as the sole beacon of freedom and democracy in a volatile region.
""Like you, for me, supporting Israel is a matter of faith,"" Haley told the crowd. ""But supporting Israel is also a basic test of American leadership. It's not just the right thing. It's the smart thing. Standing with Israel has always been in America's interest.""
""Think about it. Israel shares our values and our vision for peace,"" she added. ""She's a nation of faith and a beacon of freedom — a democratic island in a sea of tyranny.""

Thank you, Pastor Hagee.
You know, we've stood side-by-side in this cause for quite a while now.
We've come to Washington together. We've gone to Israel together. And we've prayed together, many times.
I've learned so much from you and Diana. And while this is a night to honor Israel, this is a year to honor you.
Congratulations on your 65 years of preaching the truth – and your lifetime of service to Israel and the Lord of Israel!
It's so good to be back at CUFI.
This is one of my favorite nights of the year. Being here always warms my heart.
As you know, this isn't my first time speaking to you.
But this is the first time I've joined you as a candidate for President of the United States.
I'm running for President for so many reasons.
To make America strong.
To make America proud.
And I'm running to restore America to its rightful role in the world.
We need a leader who will stand by our friends and stand up to our enemies.
And we must have a president who stands with Israel – without apology!
Like you, for me, supporting Israel is a matter of faith.
But supporting Israel is also a basic test of American leadership.
It's not just the right thing. It's the smart thing. Standing with Israel has always been in America's interest.
Think about it. Israel shares our values and our vision for peace.
She's a nation of faith and a beacon of freedom – a democratic island in a sea of tyranny.
And Israel isn't just a friend. We share the same enemies.
Virtually everything about Israel justifies America's longstanding support.
When she is strong, we are stronger. When she is safe, we are safer.
The leaders of both parties have understood this for 70 years.
Republicans and Democrats have stood with Israel.
That is, until recently.
When I say this president has been a disappointment, it's the understatement of the decade.
From day one, Joe Biden has weakened America and failed to stand by Israel.
America is in global retreat. Israel is in greater danger.
It doesn't have to be like this. And we can't afford four more years of weakness – or even a year and a half.
We need a pro-Israel president – whoever she may be!
We need a leader who not only respects Israel, but also respects her people's right to govern themselves.
Joe Biden has attacked that right.
I'm sure you remember earlier this year. Israel was debating judicial reforms.
The back-and-forth was intense. But that's what happens in a democracy.
You debate. You disagree. You find a way forward.
Israel, like America, has the right to decide its own laws. No other country should dive into its internal debates.
A wise president would have known that.
But Joe Biden continues to show us what a weak president looks like.
He called on Israel's Prime Minister to, and I quote, ""walk away"" from his reforms.
He then said the Prime Minister ""cannot continue down this road.""
And just today, Biden called Netanyahu to complain.
He won't let it go. And he's more focused on Israel's domestic debates than the mess he's made in America.
This isn't just wrong. It's dangerous.
Joe Biden is risking our friendship with Israel – just because he doesn't like Benjamin Netanyahu.
And for the record, it took Joe Biden far too long to invite Netanyahu to the U.S.
He finally made the offer today. But as recently as last week, he refused. And Biden tried to justify it by pointing to the Prime Minister's coalition partners.
That's pretty rich, coming from Joe Biden.
He has AOC and the Squad in his party. And just this week, a leading Democrat called Israel a ""racist state.""
The Democratic Party is the definition of extreme. It's time to censure the Squad and get anti-Semitism out of America – for good!
This is not what an ally does. This is not how a friend treats another friend. And it's certainly not how I treated Israel at the U.N.
But this isn't just an insult to Israel. It makes America look small and petty.
Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot. If Israel's leader demanded that America stop some judicial reform.
We would never tolerate that. And we shouldn't.
The conclusion is unmistakable.
Joe Biden needs to stay out of Israel's business! And he should end the chaos in America that he's created!
We need a leader who builds bridges with our friends. Not someone who puts a gulf between us.
When I was ambassador, I worked hard to deepen our friendship with Israel.
Lord knows, it was no small feat.
Just before I got to the U.N., the Obama Administration threw Israel under the bus.
They abstained on the resolution condemning Israel – in front of the whole world. It was shameful.
Until then, the U.S. had vetoed that resolution for decades.
Staying silent was a failure of moral leadership – and a slap in the face to our friend.
It was my job to clean up the Obama administration's mess. I took my duty seriously.
When I arrived at the United Nations, we ditched protocol.
The U.S. had always met with the same countries, in the same order. Israel was nowhere near the top of the list.
But I made meeting with Israel a priority.
And I told their ambassador I'd never abstain – that I would always have Israel's back.
I'll send an even stronger message as president.
When Joe Biden took office, he ignored our best friend in the Middle East for a whole month. That's how long he took to call Israel's leader.
Not me.
As president, I'll call Israel on day one – and I'll make clear that we stand together!
We need a leader who does the right thing.
Not like President Biden, who recently declared a boycott of Israel.
We're stopping cooperation with Israeli science and research projects in Judea and Samaria.
The White House says such partnerships are quote ""inconsistent with U.S. foreign policy.""
No, they're not.
But the president's actions are consistent with his and Obama's opposition to Israel.
If these were science projects in China, you can be sure Biden would fund them. But not Israel!
We shouldn't be canceling cooperation with Israel. We should deepen our ties.
And the only thing we should boycott is BDS, like I did as governor of South Carolina.
We were the first state in the country to do so – now 37 states have followed our lead!
We need a leader who knows the difference between right and wrong.
It's not hard.
It's wrong to support a group that routinely calls Israel evil, while ignoring real evil.
It's wrong to be part of an organization that teaches children to hate Israel.
When I was ambassador, the United States pulled out of U.N. agencies that spew hatred toward the Jewish State and the Jewish people.
The U.N. Human Rights Council does little more than criticize Israel. For the record, Israel has an excellent human rights record.
Meanwhile, the Council ignores countries like China that are actively engaged in genocide.
That's why we pulled out of the Human Rights Council.
And the same goes for UNRWA. That U.N. organization uses American money to feed Palestinian hatred of the Jewish State.
We said no more. We cut ties with UNRWA.
And we pulled out of UNESCO, too. That agency is supposed to protect the world's heritage. Instead, it denies the Jewish people's history.
America should fight anti-Semitism – not fund it with tax dollars!
Apparently, Joe Biden disagrees.
Remember how it took him a month to call Israel's prime minister? It only took him two weeks to announce he'd rejoin the Human Rights Council.
Not long after that, he started giving American money to fund UNRWA again.
And just last month, the Biden administration announced we're jumping back into UNESCO.
This is insane! It's insulting to Israel and America.
None of these groups are doing anything different. The Biden administration didn't demand reforms as a condition of U.S. membership or taxpayer money.
They are doing the bidding of tyrants and anti-Semites – all with the blessing of the United States.
But not for long.
Less than two years from now, the Haley administration will pull out of every anti-Israel group – period!
We need a leader who stands up to bullies. We need a president who makes the Middle East safer.
We know it can be done.
Just a few years ago, we finally took major steps toward peace between Israel and the Arab world.
The Abraham Accords are one of the greatest foreign policy achievements of the 21st Century.
And I intend to build on that achievement. We'll bring peace to the Middle East once and for all!
People said it would never happen. I know, because they told me when I was ambassador.
They couldn't have been more wrong. The Arab world just needed a little push. And the United States just needed to stand strong.
The truth is, we could have gone even further. More countries were close to peace with Israel.
But not anymore.
The same people who said peace was impossible are back in charge, in the Biden administration.
Turns out, they're the ones who pushed peace out of reach. They're doing it again.
Biden has continued to push friendly countries away. And he's pushing them into the arms of our enemies.
Today, countries like Saudi Arabia think China and Russia are better partners than the United States.
Think about that. They'd rather work with a communist tyrant than the leader of the free world.
For the sake of America, and for Israel, we need to make Joe Biden a one-term president.
We need a leader who advances peace in the Middle East.
And of course, we need a leader who will stop Iran from starting a war.
How is it that Joe cozies up to Iran while dissing Israel?
When I spoke to you last year, the situation with Iran was bad.
It's even worse now.
Many believe Iran is only months or even weeks away from having the capability to get a nuclear bomb.
But the Biden administration has done absolutely nothing.
Actually, that's a little unfair.
Biden hasn't done nothing. He's given Iran exactly what it wants.
The president waived sanctions on Iran's nuclear program.
He's lifted sanctions on some of its missile companies. You know, the ones that make the missiles that will carry nuclear weapons.
What's more, Joe Biden is letting Iran skirt sanctions on oil exports.
Talk about foolish! We've given away our best bargaining chip. When Iran feels pain, it feels pressure to change.
Biden has taken the pressure off. And in its place, he's done nothing but talk.
Joe Biden thinks the ayatollahs are negotiating in good faith.
They aren't. They never have. And they never will. They hate us and they hate Israel.
Iran is playing Joe Biden like a fiddle – just like it did Barack Obama.
After years of talking, Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than ever before. But what does the president want to do?
You guessed it. He wants to chat some more!
The Biden administration has now reopened discussions for a new Iran deal. It's unbelievable.
Iran spent the past two years saying it wouldn't budge. Biden showed weakness. Now the ayatollahs are in a stronger position. And he thinks now they'll do what we want?
No chance. They're not going to give up anything – especially their nuclear program.
A nuclear deal will only lead to more Iranian oppression and more Iranian terrorism.
If you want a preview, just look at what happened in Jenin over the past few weeks.
That place is a hive of terrorists who do nothing but attack Israel – with Iran's support.
Israel was right to go into Jenin. And Joe Biden is wrong to support creating more Jenins. That's exactly what a new Iran deal would do.
But the worst part of a new Iran deal is that it guarantees Iran will get a nuclear weapon.
Joe Biden should know that. It says a lot that he doesn't.
You might have seen that I have called for mental competency tests for politicians who are over the age of 75.
It's a very basic test that most would pass. But Joe Biden's pursuit of a new Iran deal is the best proof yet that he would fail!
Israel's survival hangs in the balance.
The ayatollahs have promised to destroy Israel – many times. We have to take them at their word.
Make no mistake: Israel will act before that happens. It will do what it's always done and protect itself from annihilation. It must do that.
The Biden administration should support Israel.
But if it does not, then Israel should do itself and the rest of the world a favor.
I hope it doesn't come to that, but if it does, then Israel should end the Iranian nuclear program – once and for all.
America has a duty to support Israel.
But we also have a deeper duty to ourselves.
The only way we'll stand with Israel is if we first stand for America.
There's a reason we've come to this dangerous place.
There's an explanation why our bipartisan consensus on Israel is falling apart.
Too many of our fellow citizens have forgotten the principles that bind us together. We've lost trust in each other, and we've lost faith in God.
We need to regain our pride and patriotism. And we need to remember… God is just getting started with America.
I firmly believe we'll come through this difficult time. We always have. I've seen it throughout my own life.
Thank God for the great men and women in our military.
Michael's service reminds me of America's special role. And my time at the U.N. reminded me of our nation's exceptionalism, too.
One day stands out among the rest.
It was the day I stood on the Simon Bolivar bridge between Colombia and Venezuela, watching thousands of Venezuelans holding their children, walking for hours in the hot sun to get the one meal they might have that day.
They were coming from a land of socialist tyranny where people were killing zoo animals for food. I stood there for what seemed like hours. The flow of people never stopped.
When I left the bridge, I went to a nearby shelter where the Venezuelans were gathering. You won't be surprised that it was run by a church.
I met with some of the refugees and hugged them. Then more and more families started to gather around.
I didn't get it. Why were they flocking to someone they'd never met?
Then it hit me. They didn't care who I was. They cared where I was from.
In me, they saw America, and in America, they saw hope.
It's up to us to renew that hope, for our country's sake, and for the sake of Israel.
I believe, with all my heart, that we're up to the challenge. And like all of you, I look to the Bible for inspiration.
We will fight the good fight… we will keep the faith… and yes, my friends… we will finish, and win, the race.
Thank you. God bless you – God bless Israel – and God bless America.

Pence in WSJ: Only Weapons Can Win Ukraine War,2023-07-17T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-wsj-only-weapons-can-win-ukraine-war,"
Europe should provide humanitarian aid so the U.S. can provide tanks, F-16s and artillery shells. by Mike Pence 
Please read the full article HERE.
I recently traveled to Kyiv to meet with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. I can report that what Russian troops are doing to Ukrainians is not just war—it is evil. After my visit, I am more resolved than ever in my belief that it is in America's national interest to give the Ukrainian military the support it needs to repel Russia. Sadly, President Biden has made the U.S. a laughingstock on the world stage. Beginning with his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mr. Biden has exchanged American exceptionalism for international disgrace. In Ukraine, it is clear that Mr. Biden has no plan other than committing America to a new ""forever war,"" running up a costly tab of Ukrainian lives and money that neither the U.S. nor Ukraine can afford to pay. He has said we will support Ukraine ""as long as it takes,"" but the truth is that it shouldn't take very long.
…
Make no mistake: This is not America's war. But freedom is America's fight. And I believe that if Mr. Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, the day will come when a NATO ally is directly threatened, tragically pulling American forces into a war that could have been avoided if the U.S. had done more to support Ukraine's courageous stand.
…
Securing victory in Ukraine and restoring American greatness on the world stage will require a decisive reversal by America's leaders. But America's history has proven indisputably that we have the mettle to rise to the moment and stand strong against our nation's most fearsome foes.

Michael's service reminds me of America's special role. And my time at the U.N. reminded me of our nation's exceptionalism, too.
One day stands out among the rest.
It was the day I stood on the Simon Bolivar bridge between Colombia and Venezuela, watching thousands of Venezuelans holding their children, walking for hours in the hot sun to get the one meal they might have that day.
They were coming from a land of socialist tyranny where people were killing zoo animals for food. I stood there for what seemed like hours. The flow of people never stopped.
When I left the bridge, I went to a nearby shelter where the Venezuelans were gathering. You won't be surprised that it was run by a church.
I met with some of the refugees and hugged them. Then more and more families started to gather around.
I didn't get it. Why were they flocking to someone they'd never met?
Then it hit me. They didn't care who I was. They cared where I was from.
In me, they saw America, and in America, they saw hope.
It's up to us to renew that hope, for our country's sake, and for the sake of Israel.
I believe, with all my heart, that we're up to the challenge. And like all of you, I look to the Bible for inspiration.
We will fight the good fight… we will keep the faith… and yes, my friends… we will finish, and win, the race.
Thank you. God bless you – God bless Israel – and God bless America.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Eight Counties in Two Days: Ron and Casey DeSantis Spend the Weekend in Iowa,2023-07-16T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-eight-counties-two-days-ron-and-casey-desantis-spend,"
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Covering eight Iowa counties in just two days, Ron DeSantis and Casey DeSantis blitzed the Hawkeye State over the weekend. They met with Iowans in Webster, Hamilton, Boone, Story, Marshall, Madison, Warren, and Polk counties.
On Friday, Governor DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis spoke to a packed room of Iowans at Olde Boston's Restaurant and Pub in Fort Dodge.
Following this, Governor DeSantis joined Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig for a tour of the POET Biorefining plant in Jewell, IA. He later heard from farmers, producers, and agricultural leaders at a roundtable in Boone County with Secretary Naig. The group discussed energy independence and Joe Biden's suffocating regulations, which have hurt farmers in Iowa and across America.
Governor DeSantis then headed to Des Moines to speak at the annual FAMiLY Leadership Summit, where he delivered the best interview performance of all the Republican presidential candidates. Watch his full remarks here.
Florida's First Lady Casey DeSantis spent time hearing from local residents at a coffee shop in Ames, followed by a stop at the Central Iowa Fair in Marshalltown. There, she spoke with mamas, grandmas, and parents about Mamas for DeSantis: an effort she launched last week in Johnston alongside Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds to elect Ron DeSantis as President of the United States.
On Saturday, the Governor and First Lady DeSantis hosted another meet and greet in Winterset at a packed Pizza Ranch. Iowa Senate President Amy Sinclair introduced the governor for his remarks.
After this, they met with 35 pastors and faith leaders in Indianola. They discussed their faith, the Governor's leadership in Florida, and the First Lady's Hope Florida initiative before taking questions from the group. The pastors then prayed over the couple on their journey.
To top off the trip, the Governor headlined Congressman Zach Nunn's Top Nunn: Salute to the Troops BBQ celebrating and honoring veterans alongside the congressman and Senator Joni Earnst. After speaking, the three leaders launched paper airplanes into the crowd and then stood together for a press gaggle.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Today, Governor DeSantis joined Howie Kurtz on Fox News Channel's Media Buzz. See the highlights below.
Watch the interview HERE.
On combatting false media narratives:
""I think the good thing about it is Republican primary voters are very smart. They know where these corporate outlets stand on the political spectrum. And so the extent that they become convinced that the media does not want me to be the nominee above all else, that will in the long run absolutely help me. And I think it's interesting that they're talking about some of this campaign process. We were five and a half weeks as a candidate in the second quarter for fundraising. We raised more money than Joe Biden did in the second quarter, who's the sitting president, and we raised more money than Donald Trump did into his campaign, who of course was the former president, and yet they tried to spin that negatively. So I think they have a predetermined narrative. But here's the thing, Howie, we were just in Iowa on Friday at the Family Leaders Summit. That was effectively the kickoff to Iowa caucus season so Iowans are starting to pay more attention to it. We were able to talk to thousands of people over a two-day period. The number one thing I hear from people is this, they come up to me [and say] ' know you did good in Florida. I heard good things, but I hadn't seen you yet, and now that I've seen you, I'm for you.' And so that's going to be what we're going to do over the next six months.""
On participating in debates:
""I'm going to be at the debates. I think it's a great opportunity. And especially for a guy like me, there's a lot of Republican voters out there - they like what we've done in Florida. They know I'm a good governor, but they haven't seen a lot about me up close and personal. So that gives us a great opportunity to be able to share our vision. How are you going to beat Biden, how are you going to be able to get this stuff done? What are the key things that you want to be able to do, from getting rid of Biden's damage, to stopping the invasion at the border, to slaying the administrative state, all those things are really, really important. And I think that first debate, you're going to have, millions and millions of people are going to tune into it. So I look forward to it. I think it's great to be in an environment where you're asked tough questions and having to articulate why you should be the next president of the United States and what we found on the campaign trail, [in] these early states when we're able to make that case to voters directly, we get a tremendous response. And so we're excited for the debates in August.""
On his plan to break the swamp:
""Some of these people have proven to be fiercely partisan in how they actually apply power, and that's a huge, huge problem because you can win the electoral college as a Republican, you get in there, and then what the executive branch continues to go left because these are ""supposedly nonpartisan people,"" but they're acting partisan. So we're going to reduce through attrition. We are going to remove - we're going to order every Cabinet Secretary to reduce the footprint of employees within DC by 50%. So some of that may mean more people retire, some you don't fill the positions, but people are going to be transferred to other parts of the country and I do think Presidents have more ability to fire bureaucrats than they've tried. So for example, we're going to create something called Schedule F. Anybody that has any policymaking role is going to be recategorized, not subject to civil service and can be fired at will. So we have a lot of levers at our disposal and we are going to push those levers because we cannot have a situation where we the people have the bureaucracy unelected constantly imposing its will on us. We're going to impose our will on it.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Has the Courage to Take on China,2023-07-15T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-has-the-courage-take-china,"
The Nashua Telegraph by Melinda Tourangeau
The following op-ed was published in the Nashua Telegraph July 15, 2023.
I know what American strength looks like. I saw it when, as an officer in the U.S. Air Force, I worked on President Ronald Reagan's historic Star Wars initiative – a program that scared the Soviet Union so much, it contributed to that regime's collapse and our victory in the Cold War. It was proof that peace comes through strength, a lesson I learned time and again in 17 years in uniform.
I also know what American weakness looks like. We're seeing it under Joe Biden. He's retreated from the world and let our enemies rush into the breach. They're laughing at our impotence. Especially Communist China. They're the new Soviet Union in a second Cold War. Yet the U.S. isn't fighting to win.
I know America deserves a better leader. Someone who can end this era of weakness, restore our strength, and protect our country and families in the 21st Century.
Joe Biden is clearly not that leader.
I believe Nikki Haley is.
Nikki Haley has the courage and confidence that this moment demands. She proved it in her time at the United Nations. As Ambassador, she stood toe-to-toe with the world's worst dictators. Russia. North Korea. And yes, Communist China. She never apologized and she always showed strength. She rallied countries to stand with America, precisely because she believes in America and fights for our freedom.
Nikki Haley proved her strength again in a speech last month on the Chinese threat. She recognizes that China is using every tool at its disposal to weaken us. It's in our colleges. It's corrupting our economy. It's infiltrating our culture. And it's trying to overtake our military. Nikki is the only candidate with a comprehensive strategy to protect our people and preserve peace.
In that sense, Nikki Haley is the polar opposite of Joe Biden. She is strong where he is weak. And where he's created and worsened problems, she's offering real and achievable solutions.
Look at fentanyl. China is behind the surge of drugs that's coming over our border and killing our loved ones, since Chinese companies make most of the chemicals. Biden has done nothing to stop the flood. Nikki is calling to end normal trade relations with China until it stops killing our people.
Look at our economy. China is stealing our best technologies to strengthen its military. Amazingly, Joe Biden is still allowing sensitive high-tech exports to China. Nikki has called to end those exports, stop American investment in Chinese companies that threaten our national security, and rebuild our manufacturing base so we aren't dependent on China for critical things like medicine and computer chips.
Look at our homeland security. China is running propaganda centers at our colleges, buying farmland next to our military bases, and lobbying our own government with Communist lies. Joe Biden has let all of this happen without a response. Nikki has laid out a plan to get Chinese influence out of America for good.
And of course, look at our military – the same military in which I proudly served. China is building the biggest navy the world has ever seen, as well as more nuclear and hypersonic missiles, stealth fighters, and even space warfare technologies.
We have to stay ten steps ahead of China. Yet under Joe Biden, our Navy is shrinking, our hypersonic missiles are grounded by red tape, and our Armed Forces can't meet their recruiting goals. Nikki Haley has promised to roll back the woke nonsense in our military, roll out the weapons and tools we should have had ten years ago, and keep the peace by ensuring we can win any war. I know she means it because her husband is deployed overseas at this very moment.
How do you know Ambassador Haley is on the right track? Because the Chinese embassy lashed out at her speech. It said that standing up to China ""will ultimately harm everyone's interests."" It even threatened that anyone who threatens China ""will end up on the ash heap of history.""
The Chinese government doesn't respond to people it doesn't see as threats. Clearly, China is worried about Nikki Haley. It should be.
Nikki's strategy to confront China springs from her deep love of America. She knows that our freedom is worth defending, especially from an enemy that wants to swallow our country in communist tyranny. Nikki Haley is proud of America, and as she often says, ""we have a country to save.""
I did just that in the uniform. Now I'll do it again by doing my part for Nikki in the first primary state in the nation.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - What I Saw In The North Country,2023-07-15T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-what-i-saw-the-north-country,"
The Conway Daily Sun by Nikki Haley
You learn a lot from rural life. I certainly did growing up.
When my parents came to America from India, they settled in Bamberg, South Carolina – population 2,500. The small town represented the best of this country. As a child, I saw a deep love of freedom, a deep kind of faith, and a deep sense of community. Neighbors would help neighbors. It was one family.
Small-town life had a big impact on me. It shaped my view of America and my respect for the values that make our nation exceptional. And when I stepped into public service, especially as governor, I knew I had to represent the rural areas I grew up around. I fought for the people who others forget — the people who know this country is blessed, and bless it further by their hard work.
This was on my mind last week as I traveled through New Hampshire's beautiful and rural North Country.
Like my hometown, the North Country is the kind of place that most people overlook and undervalue.
It's off the beaten path, so candidates almost never go there. But it's as much a part of New Hampshire as the rest of the state. For that matter, it's every bit as American. And the great people who live there want a leader in Washington who will fight for them.
My time in the North Country took me far and wide. We started near the Maine border in North Conway and made our way across the state to Lancaster, Lincoln, Littleton, and Hanover. I answered voters' questions at town halls, visited a local café (the cookies at The Moon Bakery and Café are worth it), talked with veterans on a motorcycle ride for charity, and attended a summer cookout.
People told me about the problems they face, and the problems facing America. They're looking for the solutions that will help the North Country, and America, thrive.
There are so many challenges. Fentanyl is killing friends and loved ones. Despite President Joe Biden's insistence that ""Bidenomics is working,"" inflation is still strangling family budgets. And parents who've sacrificed day after day wonder what kind of future their children will have. People are worried the next generation will be worse off, that America is in decline.
I understand the fear. China and Russia think we're in decline, too. They see the Biden administration and so-called progressives destroying America from within by telling our children that the freest country in human history is racist. An entire generation is being raised to believe that America isn't worth fighting for.
But I know better. And my message in the North Country was simple: America will survive.
How do I know this? Because we're going to restore respect for the principles and practices that define places like North Conway, New Hampshire and Bamberg, South Carolina. We're going to bring back America's best.
The biggest reason our country is struggling right now is because too many people have forgotten that love of freedom, powerful faith, and profound community that exist in small towns. We need those things more than ever. We need to make America strong and proud again.
This starts by electing a new president. Biden has made America weak and woke, not strong and proud. When we defeat him next year, we can end this weakness and get rid of the wokeness.
That means securing our border and rebuilding our military. It means standing up to our enemies and having the backs of our allies. It means reining in reckless spending and building a booming economy that works for rural communities as much as big cities.
And it means moving people from welfare to work while preparing our children for a life of purpose and patriotism. We have to stop poisoning our children's heads with lies. We need to tell them the truth: That even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America.
The good people in the North Country know it. I heard them say it, over and over. They're proud of our past, but frustrated with the present. And they know we can make a change to ensure a brighter future.
It's time we had a president who hears their voices and reflects their values. I will do just that.

"Remarks at the Tennessee GOP Statesman Dinner in Nashville, Tennessee",2023-07-15T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/remarks-the-tennessee-gop-statesman-dinner-nashville-tennessee,"
Good evening, Tennessee. I had to come up and see where people who leave blue states move to when they don't choose Florida so it's great to be here. I'm excited because 2024 is our opportunity to send Biden to his basement in Delaware where he belongs. Now, we, my wife and I were in Iowa earlier today and so this is the second state on our agenda. Biden, I think has been in two states to today. Confusion and disorientation. But that's just another day at the office here. Look, you got to kind of admire this is a guy that wakes up every morning and his people let him know that he's the President of the United States. Imagine finding that out every morning.
So, we we've got a lot of work to do. This country is in decline. We see it with our own eyes. We can feel it in our bones. Biden is the custodian of American decline. As our country declines, our freedoms have become under assault. I think our mission is very simple. We must reject the idea that as Republicans, our job is to just manage the decline a little bit better than the Democrats. I am not interested in managing the decline of this country. I want to reverse the decline of this country. We need a new birth of freedom in this country. The problems that we face economically are problems that have been induced by the government itself. They have borrowed, they have spent, they have printed trillions and trillions of dollars. Look, if you could just print and spend money with no consequence, why not just do 20 trillion, 30 trillion and we could all just live happily ever after. But we know instinctively that somebody has to pay the bill. So, who has paid the bill for what Washington has done? Average Americans, working class people, small businessmen who have to pay more for everything? The inflation that we've seen in the higher prices is an invisible tax that has affected each and every American in this country. Washington has benefited - seven of the 10 wealthiest counties in this country, our suburbs of Washington DC. How does that happen? They're not producing anything of note except mountains of debt and quite a bit of hot air. No, they are doing these policies because people that are connected to the political class benefit and all the rest of the American people get left holding the bag. In Florida, we've actually done it right. We are just rated by CNBC, which is not a fan of me. We just got rated the number one economy in the United States - massive growth, low taxes. miniscule debt. Our state government footprint is the lowest amount of government workers per capita in the entire United States of America. We get out of people's way and we manage the budget effectively. We've actually paid down billions of dollars of state debt, and we have set the second lowest per capita debt in the country. Don't tell me this can't be done. We need to have a president that can go into Washington and will actually hold the line on excessive spending and we haven't had that probably since Ronald Reagan. If you look at the debt that's been accumulated, yeah, we can sit here and hit Biden and he deserves a lot of it. But it wasn't just the Democrats. Republicans and Democrats in DC are both responsible for putting us $32 trillion dollars in debt. It's time to stop and go a different direction.
And part of the way we do that is we actually grow the economy. We need to open up all of our domestic energy for production. We should be energy independent in this country. And part of that means the federal government should not be forcing you to do an electric vehicle. If you want to do it, do it, that's fine. But to force people in that, like California wants to force people to do electric vehicles within like the next few years, and they can't even keep the power on for their people. Now, when we had hurricane Ian in Florida at the end of September, you know, we had massive power outages but we had people ready to go, got the power back on everything like that. Two weeks after the storm, there was a higher percentage of people in California without power than in Florida. And that was just the normal course of how they do business. So, then you're going to have 10, 15 million electric cars plugging into the power grid. It will not work and oh by the way, who benefits when we force people into electric vehicles? China benefits because all the materials that go into those are produced in China. So, I want our own domestic energy. I want the jobs associated with that. And I want to save the American automobile, so we are ripping out all of Biden's electric vehicle mandates on day one. And speaking of China, we should not have, and in Florida we prohibited land purchases by the CCP, no farmland, no land near military bases, nothing. We should have done that in this country by now. And we need to do that so that we can protect the American people.
We're also going to make sure on day one, that we prevent the imposition of something called the central bank digital currency. And I think most of you know what that is. For those who don't know what that is what they want to do. And this is people in DC. It's people in Davos that like the World Economic Forum, and this is something that people affiliated with China also want for their country. They want to go to a cashless society. They want to eliminate cryptocurrency, and they want to force all transactions through this central bank digital currency that will be supervised by the Fed. Why do they want to do that? Because they want to impose a social credit system on this country. They want to be able to police purchases that they don't like. So if you're doing too much gasoline, they'll stop a purchase. You're buying too much ammunition they won't like that they'll stop a purchase. It's a way for them to exert total control over your economic behavior. Biden is studying this. The Fed is thinking about potentially implementing it. In Florida, I signed legislation banning it in our state and as president on January 20, 2025, CBDC dies in this country because we are going to toss it in the trash can. And we're not going to let it happen in the United States of America. But make no mistake, your economic freedom is under assault by these people, and they want nothing more than to exert more control over how you use the resources that you burn.
We also need to restore this country's sovereignty. You cannot have an open border where millions and millions of foreign nationals illegally pour into this country. So on day one. - on day one, we will declare the border to be a national emergency. We will marshal all available resources, including the US military to stop the invasion cold. Yes, we will actually build a border wall because I think you do need it. But we will do something no president has been willing to do hold the Mexican drug cartels accountable for what they are doing to our country. And that means be very honest about what we're going to do when I was down. I was down in Texas a couple of weeks ago, it just kind of wide open. I was in Arizona a few weeks before that they actually had portions of a border wall. It's kind of these reinforced steel beams. And I was looking at it and I saw these guys sitting at the base of the wall doing work and I said what do you guys doin? And they're like, we're repairing it. I'm like what happened? They're like the cartels cut a hole through it and started running drugs through it. And so now we're repairing it. And I'm like, What did anyone stop them? Like now the Border Patrol doesn't care. They just kind of let it happen. Well, there'll be new rules on January 20, 2025. Because if a cartel is trying to cut through a border wall and run product into this country, that's going to be the last thing that cartel operative ever did because they are going to end up stone cold dead._
We will restore the sovereignty of this country. We also need to restore religious freedom in this country. We have situations. You know you y'all hear about some of these Supreme Court cases a Coach Kennedy in Washington State wins at the Supreme Court. He lost his job as a football coach, because he wanted to hold a prayer at midfield after a high school football game. So he loses his job. He's got to go all the way to Supreme Court and yes, he wins. And that's, quote, 'a victory.' But our Founding Fathers would have never believed that saying a prayer would have caused you to have to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. We see this 303 Creative Case. They go all the way to the Supreme Court to say wait a minute, Colorado can't force you to do messages that you disagree with and that conflict with your Christian faith. Yeah, a victory. But you had three justices that ruled against them. That said the government can compel you to do so here's where we stand with respect to religious freedom. We believe in religious freedom like the Founding Fathers envisioned it in like our Constitution requires. The left in this country - the left in this country wants to take us back to pre-constitution days. What did they do prior to the American Constitution, they had toleration of religion. And that was something that our founders rejected. George Washington wrote a letter to the Hebrew congregation in Newport, Rhode Island in 1792. And he said, how happy it is to live in America, where we don't speak of mere toleration of religion based on the whims of political elites, but we recognize your right to practice religion as a gift from the Almighty. That is what we should be upholding. That is not what the left wants. What the left wants. And at the end of the day, the left's religion is woke ideology and leftist ideology. So they want to establish that as our country's orthodoxy, so they would say you have the right to practice your faith, say as a Christian but only insofar as it doesn't conflict with their agenda. That is not religious liberty, that is toleration. So when we become - when we get in, we're going to make sure that every single American has full religious liberty without regard to what any leftist elite has to say about it. We also see the family and parents are under assault by leftist ideologues. Parents have a fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children. That's the law in Florida. That needs to be the law in every state in this country. The left doesn't believe that they believe that well, you hear Biden, what does he say? He says, Hey, these are all of our kids, not your kids. They're all of our kids. First of all, Joe, they're not your kids. Second of all, before you're saying they're all of our kids, why don't you spend some time with your granddaughter in Arkansas, or at least recognize her existence before you start worrying about our kids. So we have a right as parents to direct the education and upbringing of our kids. And in Florida, we've had to take very strong stance on that. We had to stand up against critical race theory and we have eliminated that from our K through 12 schools. We stood up. We stood up against gender ideology in our schools, it is wrong to tell a second grader that she may have been born in the wrong body or that her gender is a choice, yet that is what the left wants to impose in schools across this country. Now when we did that in Florida, the left got very upset. The media got very upset. And we actually had a business in Central Florida that some of you may have heard of – Disney - that got very upset. And if you know anything about Florida politics, Disney's basically the 800 pound gorilla anytime they weigh in on something. That's pretty much the end of it. I think they've gotten pretty much everything they've wanted for almost 60 years until me, and so that was people said this isn't going to happen. Governor's not going to be able to sign the bill. Yada yada yada well. I did not take an oath of office to subcontract out my leadership to a woke corporation based in Burbank, California. That's not leadership. And that's not what we're doing. We're going to put our kids first. We're going to put our parents first and we're going to make sure of course that we signed the bill. We've now expanded the bill and everything is fine, but I'll tell you, I have most of these Republicans attacking me for siding with the children versus Disney. And that's a vision of the Republican Party when you're siding with woke corporations over your own constituency that is not going to win elections. And it's not the morally right thing to do. We have to draw a line on the sand when it comes to our children. We oppose the sexualization of minors and we will battle anybody who seeks to rob them of their innocence. Even the biggest baddest Corporation of them all. We will stand for what's right. And if you can't do that, you've got no business being elected dog catcher as a Republican.
And we see the same thing with how they want to keep parents out of knowing what curriculum is being used in the schools. Florida we pass curriculum transparency, you as a parent have a right to know what is being taught in your kids school and you have the right to blow the whistle. And object. If you have something that's inappropriate, and unfortunately, they are trying to jam pornographic materials in the schools. So we've done it in Florida and the parents have blown the whistle. The media says Florida is banning books. They're trying to ban books. First of all, you can go to Florida and get whatever you want. I actually did a press conference where I showed all the books that had the parents had objected to and we put it on a big screen. The news stations had to cut their feed because they said it was too graphic to air on TV. Well if it's too graphic for the six o'clock news, how's it okay for a 10 year old school child? You got to wonder the motivations of some of these people. If as an adult if you want adult material, the proper place is not a fourth grade classroom. Okay, go view Hunter Biden's laptop for all I care just keep it away from our kids. But it all goes back. I think a lot of these problems we see in the economy at the border with the indoctrination of schools and all goes back to this woke mind virus that is really swept through a lot of liberal elites and a lot of elite institutions and I know there's some people that say, Don't worry about Whoa, you know, who cares all this other stuff. And first of all, let me tell you woke is a form of Cultural Marxism. It is trying to take apart this society, it is trying to ignore things like merit and achievement and base our society on identity politics. It represents a war on truth. Don't tell me that a man can get pregnant and expect me to accept that because I will not accept that because it is not true. Don't tell me that you can swim on the men's team for three years, then switch to the women's team and somehow be declared the women's national champion. I won't accept that because it is not true. The truth will set you free. You need to have a foundation of truth in this country. So there's value in defeating the world just on the plane of ideas alone, but woke when it corrupts institutions. It has a devastating impact on our society. I remember, I was just in Iowa, we did an event for congressman Zach Nunn and it was a salute to the troops and it was about our veterans. And I remember when I was a blue collar kid growing up in Florida as a baseball player, you know, my parents were working class and so you know, I didn't have anything handed to me. I had to work hard. I worked minimum wage jobs to get through school and everything like that, but I had accumulated some degrees and I had opportunities to be able to make a lot of money and I had different plans to do that. But 9/11 happened. And you know, we don't have a draft or anything, but I felt that I should do my part, however small, to be able to serve the country when we are in a time of conflict. And so I volunteered to serve, ended up deploying to Fallujah, Iraq. I was attached to Navy SEAL Team One during the Iraqi surge against Al Qaeda in Iraq way back in the day.
And I've always reflected on the experience I had and said, you know, I would have made a lot more money doing something else but being able to wear the cloth of your country, being able to serve honorably alongside fellow patriots, and being able to serve a mission greater than yourself, well, that provides a sense of satisfaction money just can't buy.
And I've always been proud to be associated with the military. I'm proud of our veterans, from World War Two all the way to the present. And I know a lot of people feel that way, and for people that have served, thank you for your service.
And yet, having said all that, we now have a situation where veterans come up to me frequently and say, ""I don't know if I'd want my son, daughter or grandkids to join today's military given all the nonsense that's going on."" And you don't even need to believe me. Just look at the numbers. Morale is low. They've driven off a lot of warriors and recruiting is at a post-Vietnam low. Why is that? It's because they're doing social experimentation. They're doing woke and political ideology. They are taking away from the core mission, and they're taking their eye off the ball. That is not a military that's going to be able to stand up to China. It's not a military, when the Navy is using drag queens to recruit new people, that's going to be able to defend American freedom abroad. No, that's a military that's on the wrong path. So I think on day one, we need a commander in chief that's going to remove some of the people that have created this, like General Milley, and will take the woke out of our military, rip it to shreds. focus back on the mission of what it means to serve in uniform.
So woke matters when it gets into something like the military. Woke matters when it takes over parts of our economy. You see these things like ESG that they're trying to do- in Florida, we banned ESG. It's not allowed in our pensions, no social credit scores, none of that. No woke banking, they can't discriminate against you if you're a gun owner, conservative, or Christian or any of that. So we've leaned in on it. We actually took from our pension that was being managed by Blackrock--$2 billion--we took it away from them and said we don't want your nonsense in Florida.
We stood up against it, but it's percolating in other parts of society. We're going to need to rip it up on January 20 2025. Because if ESG and other woke ideas take over our economy, the average person will end up poorer as a result of that. It will hurt people's standard of living.
Our education system. When woke overtakes the education system, and ends up indoctrinating kids into a bunch of nonsense, and the average student becomes dumber as a result of this. Do you see test scores going up in any of these woke liberal states? No, they're going down because they're focusing on all the wrong things. And look at some of the cities around this country when they get overtaken by a woke agenda. San Francisco--I was there a few weeks ago and you hear different things about San Francisco, there's--I don't know if you have ever seen on the internet there's like a map where they have dots on every place where there's been public defecation and it like fills up the entire city. It's like you can't walk anywhere that's not somebody having done, you know, done their business on the sidewalk. Not great when that's happening in the city.
So I show up. Within 15 minutes, I see some guy on the sidewalk, relieving himself, and I'm just thinking to myself, this is just standard. I saw people doing fentanyl, smoking crack right in the open. People can get mugged and nothing ever happens to the perpetrators. And that is all a function of leftist ideology. And so, the city's been hollowed out, there's not one jurisdiction in this country, city, or state that has been governed by leftist ideology that is succeeding. They are all failing and many of them are failing spectacularly.
This is a huge thing. Because if this continues to take over other institutions throughout our country and continues to take over the federal government, it will destroy this country. In Florida, we are the only place in this country, that on all these different issues, we have beat the woke; we've made the state of Florida the place where woke goes to die, and now it's our mission. It is our mission as Americans to ensure January 20, 2025, that starts where we leave woke ideology in the dustbin of history -- where it belongs.
You have some of the most important issues facing this country: what kind of energy you can use, what kind of car you can drive, that are decided not by your elected representatives, but by nameless, faceless bureaucrats sitting in the bowels of the bureaucracy up in Washington DC. We are going to return this government to its rightful owners, we the American people.
That means we're going to take parts of these agencies and parcel them out throughout the country. We're going to reduce the number of employees in DC by 50%. We are going to end the weaponization of this government once and for all.
We can't have a system where there are two standards of justice: If you're connected to the DC ruling class, then you get away with murder. I mean, if Hunter were a Republican, he would have been in jail years ago,a nd we all know that. Yet, if you're on the other side, you can get put into prison for jaywalking in DC. That is not a system that is consistent with American liberty and with the rule of law.
But in order to get there, you ,as president, have got to be willing to wield your Article 2 power. It's not something that they're going to give up. The power that they've committed, they're not going to give that up willingly. They're going to fight you tooth and nail. The bureaucrats will fight you. The media will fight you. The left will fight you. Hell, a lot of big businesses will probably end up fighting you. So in order to do it, you've got to be focused. You've got to be disciplined. You've got to know what levers are available to pull, and you've got to have the backbone to be able to pull those levers even when you're going to face intense political opposition.
In Florida, we've done without question, draining our swamp. I got into office. I removed the bad election supervisors in southwest Florida so that we could have integrity in our election system. I removed the sheriff down in Broward County who bungled the Parkland massacre the year before I became governor. And when we had a prosecutor, like you see in San Francisco, LA, Chicago, who was funded by George Soros, and said that he was not going to enforce laws in Florida that he didn't agree with. I removed him from his post. He is gone.
So what that means is you've got to be committed, and with me you don't have to worry about where I stand. You will have a new director of the FBI on day one.
You will have an Attorney General with a backbone made of steel who is going to turn the place upside down. And as President, I'm going to be willing to stand in and make the tough decisions. You can't coddle bureaucrats like Dr. Fauci. The way you treat somebody like Dr. Fauci is very simple. You tell him, Anthony, you're fired.
So here's the thing. 2024 I think gives us the best opportunity to put the country on a significantly better path for the first time since Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in 1980. I think the American people look at Biden, they know he's failed. They know the country is in the wrong direction, and they want a fresh start. They want to go in a different direction. I think we need to have a vision of that in a way that's going to be able to attract those voters who haven't voted for Republicans in recent years like we did in Florida, like some other candidates across the country have been able to do. Because we if don't do that, we're going to end up in a pit that we're not going to be able to get out of. The Democrats are playing for keeps in this country. If they're able to win the presidency again, they will almost surely take the House of Representatives and win the US Senate and with that power. They're not just going to try to hike the tax a little bit or do a little more welfare. They may try to do that, and I'm not saying those aren't important issues. But our politics right now is not about what the tax rates going to be or how many welfare benefits are going to be distributed. Our struggle right now is that are we going to reject the heritage of freedom that our founding fathers have bequeathed to us, or are we going to revive that heritage of freedom. The Democrats know that if they get in, they're not going to worry about all the small stuff. They're going to try to pack the US Supreme Court with liberal justices, erasing the conservative majority on the court. They're going to try to eliminate voter ID across the country and mandate ballot harvesting. They're going to make Washington DC a state, and they are going to eliminate the electoral college. That is a party that's trying to ensconce themselves in power for a generation, and it'd be very difficult for our voices to be heard in national affairs if they're successful about doing that. So, we cannot let them get away with it. There is no substitute for victory. We can sit here and talk about this, that, all these other things. We cannot have a culture of losing in this party where we give up winnable elections all across this country, and then have recriminations or excuses about why you can't win. Don't tell me you can't win. Go out there and get it done.
In Florida, we showed it can be done. When I got elected, our state had been one point state. President and governors' races for a decade prior had been decided by one point or less. My race was decided by half a percentage point, 32,000 votes. A lot of people said okay, because it's close, bide your time. eep your head down. Don't make any waves. You don't want to upset this political balance. I rejected that advice. My view is I may have gotten 50% of the vote but I earned 100% of the executive power. I intend to use it to advance an agenda that I believe in and that I think is the best agenda for the state. It was by governing not in pale pastels, but in bold colors that has caused Florida to have a growth and success the likes of which we've never seen in the modern history of the state. We're the first state probably in the country that has had people come from all the way across in massive numbers because of the way the state is governed. We had people, I just ran into someone the other day. So yeah, I met some guy in Orlando that came from California. Why did you come? And he's like, well, I came because I like what your governor is doing and that's usually not the way it is. But our boldness was so much different than what they were seeing in these other states that we attracted people to our cause. We ended up winning reelection, not by 32,000 votes, but by 1.5 million votes. We won the largest Republican governor landslide in the history of the state of Florida. And it's not just about me, we got in super majorities of the Florida legislature. We added four Republican members to the US Congress. We even elected, with our support, 29 new conservative school board candidates across the state, because all this is important. Politics is a team sport. You gotta do it.
We did it by winning voters who had not voted for Republicans in the past. Miami Dade County is our biggest county -- 2.8 million people. How have Republicans done in urban areas in recent years? Not very good. Hillary Clinton won Miami Dade County in 2016 by 30 percentage points. We not only won Miami Dade, we won Miami Dade County by double digits. Nobody thought that was possible just four or five years ago, and yet we did it. We did it through boldness, and we did it through leadership that I think at the end of the day is the key ingredient in terms of where we find ourselves. You can be right on policy, and, Lord knows you have to be right on policy, because what the Democrats want to do is disastrous. But being right on the issues is not enough. In this day and age, when you step forward and you stand for what's right, and you speak the truth. Whether you're a governor like me, whether you're a school board member, whether you're a parent who's concerned about your kid's education, you are going to face blowback. You will face blowback from the media, from the left. You may face blowback from the federal government itself, as we've seen where the FBI was going after parents who were going to school board meetings in Northern Virginia. You are going to have to sacrifice, whatever level you are, you're going to face blowback. So the question is, is that something that you're comfortable with? Are you going to be willing to sit there and take the arrows and continue to soldier on. That, ultimately, is the key ingredient to Florida success. Because when the country had lost its mind during COVID, when common sense suddenly became an uncommon virtue, Florida stood as a citadel of freedom and a refuge of sanity not only for our citizens, but for people all throughout this country. We fought the media. We fought the left. We fought bureaucrats like Fauci and we kept our state open. We kept our kids in school, and we ended up booming like never before. But it was not easy. Every single decision I made was met with a torrent of criticism from the usual suspects on the political left in the media and even by some Republicans. A lot of people said your political career is over. First of all, I don't care about a career. I can do a lot of other things. I'm here to serve. It's not about me. I was totally fine with that. But they're saying you got to reverse course. You can't be doing this. People are after you. But you know, a leader has got to stand in that fire and stand up for the people that he represents. You have to be more concerned about protecting the jobs of the people you're elected to serve, than you are about protecting your own political hide. And that's what we did in Florida, on COVID, on Disney, and all these other issues where we stood up and did what was right. That's the type of fortitude, that's the type of backbone that it's going to take to be able to unwind all these problems in Washington, DC. So, we're going to have to work hard. There's going to be some sacrifices, but I'm confident that it can be done. I think we have no other choice but to get it done. Not just for ourselves, our kids, our grandkids, but we owe a debt to people in prior generations who have fought for us and preserved our freedom.
I used to take the flight to Washington DC from Florida. There was a particular route you could take where you went flush parallel to the National Mall. If you looked out the left side of the plane, you would see the great monuments, Lincoln, the reflecting pool, Washington, and the other monuments. Ten up on the Hill, the beautiful US Capitol dome, and you felt a sense of pride as an American because that was symbolic of the principles that has made the country unique. I remember the tourists love that because that was kind of the first time a lot of them saw it. What I realized after doing that trip a few times was the best monuments to freedom were not seen on the National Mall looking out the left side of the plane. Because if you looked out the right side of the plane, you looked over the Potomac River, you saw a very small nondescript monuments arranged over the rolling hills of a place called Arlington National Cemetery. It occurred to me then, and I believe now that you can have the best Constitution in the world; you can have the best Declaration of Independence in the world; these things do not run on autopilot. They require people, at critical moments in history, to stand up sometimes put a uniform at risk o their lives and indeed give the last full measure of devotion and service to this country. And we can look back at those sacrifices and look what we have to do now. We're not called upon to do anything even close to that. Yeah, people may attack you. They'll say bad things about you. There are people that have given it all so that we can be free. So, we owe it to them to not squander the legacy of freedom that they have bequeathed to us. And we will get it done. We will stand firm for the truth. We will not back down to these people. We will fight the good fight. We will finish the race, and we will keep the faith. No excuses in 2024, we have got to get the job done. Thank you all. God bless you. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. God bless you, Tennessee.

And along with the culture of grievance comes this drug of victimhood, the narcotic of despair. Folks actually have figured out that you can make a profit off of conflict. I want to stand in the gap and say the truth of my life disproves the lies of the radical forces that believe that we should be in constant conflict with each other.

Yes, Biden is leading this and, in some respects, but he's really a symptom of a lot of the underlying problems. When you go in there as a new president, and you're standing for the right things, you better be prepared: the blowback from the media, from the left from the bureaucracy, all across the board, if you're standing for what's right, in this day and age, you are going to face a lot of blowback. I think what I've been able to do as governor - whether it's COVID, whether it's standing up for the innocence of our children, and on down the line - is stand into that breach, stand for people's rights and freedoms, and stand for what's right, and not give an inch to these people.

""I want to just let everyone up there know how much I respect what your governor and the legislature have done with passing the heartbeat bill. That was a big victory for life.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Focuses on Small Towns in Her New Hampshire Pitch,2023-07-13T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-focuses-small-towns-her-new-hampshire-pitch,"
NBC News by Emma Barnett
LANCASTER, N.H. — During presidential candidate Nikki Haley's latest swing through New Hampshire, she's visiting some places that don't have many voters.
Haley visited three small towns with less than 5,000 people on Thursday and Friday, holding events in North Conway, Lincoln and Lancaster. She's making a push in the northern part of the state, known as the North Country, to prove to voters that she's willing to work for every vote.
""There's not a lot of people here, but every vote counts,"" Haley said in a brief interview with NBC News on Friday, later adding, ""We want to make sure every person hears us, sees us, knows that we fought for their vote.""
After each event, Haley, the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor, has spent time looking people in the eye, listening to their stories and shaking their hands.
Haley says voters have told her, ""nobody else has been here. And so they're thrilled that we were — we took the time to come out.""
Ken Farnaso, a Haley spokesperson, said in a statement that Haley is the first ""top-tier candidate"" to visit the North Country. Farnaso noted that the area is similar to Haley's hometown in rural South Carolina.
""Our campaign never takes any vote for granted, and Nikki will work to earn every Granite Stater's support,"" Farnaso said.
Haley pointed to her small-town roots during her town hall in Lancaster, where she told voters ""I knew we were going to these small towns and I grew up in a small town, but I didn't grow up like this. This is beautiful. Like truly beautiful. This is like God's country. Like I've never seen.""
Colin Christie, a Lancaster voter, told NBC News he is ""removed from a lot of the limelight"" as a resident of a small town and he appreciated Haley's visit.
""It was important that we get a chance to voice our opinions as opposed to the general consensus of more populated areas in the southern part of our state,"" he said.
On Saturday Haley will remain in the Granite State for another town hall in Hanover as well as a summer house party in Henniker. By the end of the day on Saturday, Haley will have done 39 events in New Hampshire, according to her campaign.

Sen Scott: Well, I certainly know I have the chance to win the nomination and I plan to be the nominee. I didn't read the story and I thank God that Mr. Galston spent some time talking about how any American, from any community can live the American dream. I believe America can do for anyone what she's done for me. And that's why I'm focusing on restoring hope, creating opportunities, and protecting the America that we all love, and Pierce, I gotta tell you, Mesha is a hundred percent right. It is time for us to understand and appreciate that the Democrats, the far left weaponizes, the issues of race and class to hold onto their power and vulnerable people continue to be underrepresented in their party. Lots of folks being elected, but the difference in the communities can be measured in progress. I look forward to presenting a solution that works for all of America, because all of America wants their kids going to a safe school, all of America wants their kids growing up in safe neighborhoods, all of America wants their grandparents not locked in their houses from the time the sun goes down until the time the sun goes up. We have the solution. In my administration, we'll make sure that streets are safer, kids have a chance because their parents have a choice. This is not just a GOP message, this is what we call in America, common sense.

""Howie, the corporate press in this country does not want me to be the Republican candidate because they know I will beat the Democrats, I will beat Biden. But I think more importantly, they know I will actually get all this stuff done. I mean, what we were able to do in Florida is take an evenly divided state politically, go on a leadership where we were doing huge things from illegal immigration... we're leaning in on all these issues, delivering big results. Stood up during COVID, and we ended up winning reelection by 20 points. They see that, and so ever since our reelection, they've been doing whatever they can to try to create narratives that trip me up. Here's what I can tell you, you know it better than anyone because you're up in New England, we don't have a national primary. We have a state-by-state process so, what we focused on is getting footholds in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. I'm going to be in Iowa the next few days, we're going to be back in New Hampshire very soon, same with South Carolina, and you build support. It doesn't happen overnight. And I can tell you what we found with Republican voters, we get very favorable views, in terms of, they know I've done a good job as governor, when they come out and hear me, they sign up and they want to support us. Now that's not going to be 100,000 people at one time, it's going to be slowly but surely. So, we do that, we have the path, and we've been able to do a lot of great things. And oh, by the way, you mentioned donors, they were saying this four or five months ago, and yet we, first five and a half weeks, we raised 20 million. No one as a nonincumbent has raised that much in that period of time, you know, big support on PACs, and all this other stuff. So all that stuff is going great. And at the end of the day, it's just about putting in the work and letting people know, who am I, my bio, my family, my achievements, and my vision for the country as president. And once that's clear, we do very well.""
On the importance of putting in the work to earn the nomination:
""Nobody is entitled to this nomination. You have got to earn the nomination and do things like The FAMiLY Leader event in Iowa, doing things like these debates, they're important parts of the process. So, I'm going to be in Iowa for that. I will be in Milwaukee for the first debate, and I'll be at all the debates because the American people deserve to hear from us directly about our vision for the country, and about how we're going to be able to defeat Joe Biden.""
On the Biden administration's failed foreign affairs policies in China:
""There's a whole host of things around the world that we've got to be concerned with, and I think Biden is ignoring a lot of other threats. Of course, they think China is just a healthy competitor. I can tell you, China's not a healthy competitor. China is an adversary. China has very significant ambitions. I think a strong America with hard power will successfully deter China. But I think the direction that Biden's going is inviting a conflict with China.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis spoke with Mark Levin on The Mark Levin Show. See the highlights below.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On woke ideologies corrupting the military:
""They're letting the institution be corrupted with social experimentation and woke ideology. Mark, I joined after 9/11. I had opportunities, I was a blue-collar kid growing up, minimum wage jobs, my parents worked hard, but I never really made any money. I was kind of in a position to make some money. 9/11 happened so I was like, you know what, I've got to serve. So, I volunteered to serve, volunteered, served in Iraq, I did some other stuff. And you get a sense of pride, being able to wear that flag on your uniform, being able to wear the cloth of your country serving alongside fellow patriots, I think a lot of veterans feel that way. Yet now, for the first time in my life, veterans come up to me all the time and they say, 'I don't know if I'd want my kids or grandkids joining today's military, because of all the stuff that's going on.' Recruiting is at a post-Vietnam low. When I was in Fallujah, in the height of the Iraq war, we still had people willing to join the Marines and the Army knowing they would get sent to Iraq, and they were still willing to serve. Now, it's very difficult to get people to serve, they have driven off a lot of good warriors. Partially with this- I also think the vaccine mandates really hurt the military because it was totally unscientific and unjustifiable. So, they lost good people from that. Now you're in a situation- how are we going to be able to deter China from dominating the world, if we don't have a fighting force that has high morale, and that is really focused on the mission. So, we're going to be doing an announcement on what we're going to be doing to combat that very soon. But at the end of the day, day one as Commander in Chief, we're going to rip all the politicization and all the Biden agenda out of the military, and we're going to restore it to its proper function and morale will increase, and recruiting will increase as a result of that.""
On appointing a new director to the FBI:
""I've said very clearly since day one that I launched my campaign for president January 20, 2025, as soon as I get sworn in, there will be a new director of the FBI. This is insane, what's been going on. I saw it, I thought it was disgraceful. So, we clearly need new leadership there. I mean, we need to clean house far beyond that. But that has got to be one every presidential candidate acknowledges: he's failed, and we need to have somebody new in there. I've said that from day one.""
On protecting parents' rights:
""These parents are sending their kids to school in parts of the country and their kids are being indoctrinated. You have first graders being told that they may be born in the wrong body, and they may be a different gender. You have places in Florida- we actually, part of the reason we did our Parents' Rights in Education, you know, we had a girl who went to school, and administrators and teachers 'transitioned her' behind her mother's back. Her mother became a friend of ours, and she became an activist for this bill. So, this is just outrageous. That violates the rights of parents. That violates the freedom that Americans have to raise their kids with the values that they see fit. Schools serve an important purpose: private schools, charter schools and school districts, but they do not supersede the rights of parents. I think when you say that you're just not going to do it and let the indoctrination continue. You cannot have a healthy economy if you allow the education system to be corrupted with no push back.""
On securing the border:
""We're going to be very tough on the border, we're going to finally put this issue to bed once and for all. And that includes empowering both the Border Patrol and military to use deadly force at the border against these drug cartels that are killing Americans by the tens of thousands. They try to break into this country with fentanyl, they're going to end up stone cold dead… We obviously have situations where states like California are providing benefits to illegal aliens. In Florida, we don't do that. In fact, we just said no out of state licenses are recognized. We don't issue those licenses in Florida, and we've really gotten strong on that to try to protect our population, but you're not a country without borders. You've got to have borders. And I think some of this is there are business interests out there that just want to import cheap foreign workers to be able to undercut the wages of Americans, and I don't think that that's good policy for the United States.""

Scott Campaign Press Release - The First Six Weeks...,2023-07-12T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-the-first-six-weeks,"
JULY 12, 2023
MEMORANDUM
TO: INTERESTED PARTIESFR: JENNIFER DeCASPER, CAMPAIGN MANAGERRE: TIM SCOTT FOR AMERICA: THE FIRST SIX WEEKS

Tim Scott, the only candidate to show movement and momentum since announcing, enters the summer armed with $21 million cash-on-hand. As he prepares to take the debate stage, it is clear he not only is the best messenger and most consistent conservative in the race, but also has the resources to win.
THE RESOURCES TO WIN
Our campaign begins this next stage of the race with over $21 million cash-on-hand after raising $6.1 million in Q2. We can also proudly confirm Tim will be on the debate stage for months to come thanks to over 145,000 donations from over 53,000 unique donors across all 50 states.
No presidential candidate in American history has ever started from such a grassroots-powered position of strength. Tim's unique voice and ability to lead on today's most pressing issues, in a way that only he can, is why last cycle we had over 750,000 donations online.
He is taking his message directly to voters – whether on the set of The View, at a town hall in rural Iowa, or at a parade in New Hampshire. Tim knows his message connects with those starving for a positive, optimistic campaign. This is one of the reasons why nearly 150 South Carolina leaders endorsed him last month, and the campaign boasts a 70-person strong finance committee in his home state.
When voters see everyone from President Obama to President Biden, and even the ladies of The View attack Tim Scott, they know it isn't an accident. Tim Scott is the candidate the radical Left fears most.

NBC News: ""Few Americans know Sen. Tim Scott, but some Democrats see him as a tough general election opponent""
The Wall Street Journal: ""Editorial: Why Barack Obama Attacks Tim Scott""

WHAT IT MEANS
On Day One of our campaign, we were fully-funded through South Carolina. But this impressive grassroots-powered effort allows us to execute our plan and run this campaign on our terms.
We enter the third quarter with over $21 million COH. That's more resources ready to spend at a moment's notice than almost any other campaign in the race. Combine that with our $6 million ad buy currently running in Iowa and New Hampshire and you see a candidate with steady momentum who is ready to build on the success of the last 6 weeks.
What makes the $6.1 million raised in Q2 even more impressive is that the vast majority of it was raised in the 6 weeks since Tim announced and is solely for use in the primary. At the end of the day, candidates can post any number they want. But the name of the game is how much actual cash you have on hand that's available for use in the Republican primary.
As the campaign continues to take shape, you'll continue to see Tim Scott on the airwaves – whether on the news or in ads. But most importantly, you'll continue to see him travel across the early states, just like he's done for the last several months, introducing himself to voters, hearing what's on their minds, and earning every last vote.

Inside Elections: ""A little over a month into his presidential campaign, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has managed to do something no other hopeful has yet accomplished: show some momentum.""
The Wall Street Journal: ""Could Tim Scott Pull An Upset?""

His name is Tim Scott.
We'll see y'all in Milwaukee.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Candidate Haley Vows to Stand Up to China,2023-07-11T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-candidate-haley-vows-stand-china,"
The Conway Daily Sun by Daymond Steer
CONWAY — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said China won't be allowed to bully and steal from Americans any longer if she is elected president next year.
That's what she told a gathering of 260 people who turned out to listen to her Wednesday evening at the North Conway Community Center. The event was organized with help from the North Country Federated Republican Women and the Mount Washington Valley Republican Committee.
Haley, 51, was governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017, and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, from January 2017 to December, 2018.
She was introduced by MWV Republican Chair Jerry Goodrich and state Sen. Jeb Bradley.
""So we decided we were going to come to the North Country,"" said Haley, adding she had a couple reasons. ""One because we want you to know how hard we're going to work for you. Two, I wanted to see what it was like. I wanted to see what everybody was talking about.""
She was taken aback by the size and beauty of North Conway and added it has a lot more going on than in Bamberg, S.C., where she was raised.
""We were all excited the day we got a Hardee's and I'm looking at this place going, oh my gosh, this is heaven,"" she said.
While she is of Indian heritage, her parents taught her to view herself as being the same as the other children in their community.
While at the UN, Haley helped move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, passed strict sanctions against North Korea and pulled the U.S. out of the Iran deal.
""We took the kick me signs off of our backs,"" said Haley, adding these moves were intended to make other nations respect the U.S.
What's more, said Haley, she showed then President Donald Trump that the U.S. was giving foreign aid to hostile regimes and he ""lost his mind"" when he saw where American taxpayer dollars were being spent.
In the recent past, the U.S. has given aid to Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Russian ally Belarus and even China.
""I'm president, we will no longer give money to countries that hate America,"" she said.
She said China is the United State's biggest enemy.
""It is not being dramatic when I tell you, China is preparing for war against the United States,"" she said. ""It's all around us. You can look at the infiltration.""
She said this infiltration is multifold. She said China's is funding American universities, sends fentanyl over the border, sent a spy balloon over American airspace, opened ""spy centers"" around the country and China has even purchased of 400,000 acres of farmland.
""If they want normal trade with America then quit killing Americans,"" she said of China's role in the fentanyl epidemic. ""We've got to start being harsh with them.""
Haley pledged to ""stop them (China) being able to buy any American soil whatsoever and we take back the American soil that they've already bought.""
She said China steals $600 billion worth of intellectual property per year and the federal government does nothing.
She said there would be ""no more spy balloons over our airspace unless they're prepared to pay a price for it.""
""They (China) know what they're doing with artificial intelligence and cyber,"" said Haley. ""What are we doing? I'll tell you what we're doing, our military's taking gender pronoun classes. Think about that. They're laughing at us. We look so distracted.""
While seeking to be tough on China, Haley said she understands the needs of military families too.
Before entering politics, Haley got an accounting degree from Clemson University and worked in the private sector.
""I'm not a lawyer, accountants are problem solvers,"" she quipped.
One problem she encountered in her early days in politics, as a state representative, was that the other legislators voted themselves a pay raise on a voice vote and this ""infuriated"" her. So, she filed legislation to create transparency, and she was stripped of her seniority. This only motivated her to climb higher on the political ladder.
""So, I ran for governor and I'm proud to say one of the first bills we signed into law in South Carolina is now everything debated on the floor of the House to the Senate requires a legislative vote on the record,"" said Haley.
After becoming governor, she reversed the state's double digit unemployment crisis by bringing in major companies like Mercedes and Boeing.
""We basically dropped the 11 percent unemployment rate down to 4 percent,"" said Haley. ""We announced jobs in every single county. And then I got the call for the United Nations.""
Other accomplishments as governor she listed include passing some of the toughest immigration laws in the country and voter ID.
In terms of domestic issues, Haley, who is personally pro-life, but added, perhaps enough consensus could be reached, that there could be federal laws on late-term abortions and not jailing pregnant women seeking abortions.
She stressed as president she would clamp down on illegal immigration and take back control of the border in part by reinstating President Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy.
Asked how she would rein in the deep state, Haley said she would do it the same way she did it as governor of South Carolina and that's by replacing every agency head under her command, giving them a series of performance benchmarks to hit and incentives to save money. She would also meet with governors once per quarter not once per year as most presidents do.
During his introduction, Bradley said he debated with himself if he should first introduce Haley as governor or ambassador and he asked her preference.
""She said, 'Nikki works the best,'"" said Bradley.

"Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: ""Faith Is Always A Personal Journey""",2023-07-11T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-faith-always-personal-journey,"
CHARLESTON, SC –  Tim Scott joined The Washington Times to discuss his 2024 presidential campaign and his personal faith journey.
WATCH HERE
Tim ScottThe Washington TimesJuly 10, 2023
Billy Hallowell: Well, let's talk about your personal faith, because your Christian faith, it shines through and I've heard you speak a lot on it. We've interviewed in the past, and when you talk about faith, it's very clear that this is very real to you. It's who you are. It's a part of your journey. Let's kind of go back in time, and feel free to to dive into your personal story here, but how did you come into faith?
Tim Scott: I was on that football scholarship, a very small football scholarship at Presbyterian College. I was at an SCA meeting. I had had a horrible car accident the year before during my football season where I lost my first six weeks of my senior football season. Because I fell asleep driving at the wheel, went through the windshield, came back in, and ultimately ended up because of that car accident, missing the first six weeks of my senior football season. And I thought my life was over because football was my life, Jesus was just a game. But on a small football scholarship at Presbyterian College, I realized I had it inverted, that actually Jesus was my life, and football was just a game.
And as a kid raised in poverty, as I've said before, in a single parent household, I always wanted a father's acceptance. I always wanted to be defined by my family lineage, and what I found in my faith was just that. Galatians 3:28 says, I was adopted into the family. If I wanted you to know more about my Abba father, I could read his good book called the Bible, and I could discover all that he said about me. But more importantly, all that he said about himself and all that he is. And when you realize that faith is always a personal journey towards significance, never is it really about success. It's about significance. But the good news is, the more significant you are, it leads to a lot of success.

MILWAUKEE, Wisc. — Ron DeSantis joined Mark Belling, on WISN 1130 AM, The Mark Belling Show.
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On how to build a coalition and win the White House:
""I look at Wisconsin, and I say, if you can't win Wisconsin, you will not get the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is a must win state for a Republican. It's a very closely divided state kind of like Florida was before I came on the scene. I think we have the ingredients with how unpopular Biden is to move Wisconsin red in 2024 and build off that success going forward. How do you do it? You have got to make sure your base is coming out, which in Florida we did. I got the highest percentage of Republicans that any governor candidates ever gotten in history. But we won 62% of Latinos, we won women by 8%, we even won independents by 18%. I think it's important that Republicans will win if we can appeal to people outside of our base.""
On Mamas for DeSantis:
""When you go after the children, you awaken a sleeping giant with the mothers in this country, and we've already shown it in Florida. We protected them from the school closures and the mask mandates. Some of it was just, quite frankly, protecting their jobs with all that, but we leaned in on protecting their kids from indoctrination. When we fought on gender ideology and tussled with Disney, the media was upset at us, the left. I'll tell you, the parents across party lines agreed with us. They want schools focused on basics. They don't want schools doing things behind their back, and they want a seat at the table. We really believe that parents have a fundamental role in the education of our children, and we're going to continue stressing that.""
On ending the weaponization of government:
""I was actually in Congress when the whole collusion hoax started. I was one of probably five congressmen who actually spoke out very early. One, a lot of Republicans believed in collusion at the time. There were Congressional investigations launched in 2017, with Republican majorities on Trump, Russia collusion, and I was there really on the front lines, saying that it was a hoax. Obviously, as we got more and more information, the amount of power that was abused by the FBI, DOJ, by the intelligence agencies, was really just jaw dropping and it was something that represented one of the biggest abuses of power that we've seen in modern American history. That just goes without saying, and I have a very clear record on that. I think the question is, is, what are we going to do about it, because we had the swamp, the promise in 2016, was that he would drain the swamp, but the swamp got way worse. It's way worse today than it was in 2016. I will end the weaponization of government. And part of the reason I will do that is because I'm going to come in, and I'm going to make very strong executive decisions to clean house. For example, we will have a new director of the FBI. On day one in my administration, the former president said the jury's still out on the FBI director, I don't think the jury's still out. I think we all know, we need a new direction there, we will clean house at the Department of Justice, we will parcel out parts of these agencies to other parts of the country, so that we can stop the accumulation of power in DC. So, I think what we need to do is look forward and figure out who has the discipline, who has the commitment to detail, who's going to keep their eye on the ball, so that you can actually bring the administrative state to heal, they are not going to give up their power willingly. And they are going to eat the lunch of anybody that goes in there. And isn't focused on this day after day.""
On winning:
""I have a better record than any Republican in the country of actually beating the left. You want to talk about George Soros prosecutors, I'm the only Republican in the country that has removed a Soros prosecutor, which is what I did with one of the guys we had in Tampa. We beat the left on COVID lockdowns, we beat the left on indoctrination of our kids, we beat Disney on sexual indoctrination of our kids, we beat the left on illegal immigration, and so on. We've shown an ability to win these battles against the Democrats and against the left. I think that that's the frame of mind. I just view my job is to deliver results.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla — Ron DeSantis joined Stuart Varney on Fox Business' Varney & Co. See the highlights below.

On reversing Bidenomics:
""I think we have an opportunity to reverse Bidennomics. We need to get spending under control. We do need to do the energy initiatives that you and I discussed. We have to nuke things like ESG. We cannot have a politicized economy. It just doesn't work. We need to rip up all the bureaucratic excess so we can unleash some of the creative forces in our economy. And we do need a better education system. Stop with the indoctrination and let's focus on producing people, maybe with a college degree, but also with vocational skills that can be a part of a new era of advanced manufacturing as we look to rebuild our industrial base.""
On how stopping the invasion and securing the border is a top priority:
""I think it's secure this border, end this invasion, build this wall, and hold these Mexican drug cartels accountable. This has been a colossal failure. We will have a plan on day one to declare a state of emergency. There will be a new sheriff in town, and we will mobilize all available assets to be able to reestablish the sovereignty of this country.""
On his path to victory:
""I think it's pretty clear that the media does not want me to be the candidate. I think they have tried to create a narrative that somehow the race is over. This is going to be a state-by-state contest. We have worked really hard to build the type of organization -- in places like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina -- that you need to actually be able to win these early contests. And we are going to continue doing that. We have got a lot of work, but we have had a very, very favorable response and we're going to keep building off that momentum. At the end of the day, I think the fact that I'm the one that's attacked by the media, by the left, even by the president of Mexico is because people know that I will beat Biden and they know I will actually deliver on all these issues and beat the Democrats at the border. Beat them on things like ESG. Beat them on things like crime, and they don't want to see that. We're going to keep telling the truth and I think you're going to see good results.""
On the smears against First Lady Casey DeSantis:
""It shows my wife is an incredibly strong First Lady of Florida, a fantastic mother, and a great wife. That threatens the left. She and I kind of shrug it off because we know it just shows they view her as a threat. The message she was bringing in Iowa about the rights of parents and how we are not going to take this anymore, with the left trying to indoctrinate our kids, they understand that that resonates -- not just with Republican parents, with independent parents and, yes, Democrat parents. I think they're very worried about her effectiveness and so all that's doing is confirming that she's over the target. She's a great advocate for families, a great advocate for children. And I'm thankful that she's my wife and I'm really honored that she's willing to go out there and press the case. And so we wear criticism from MSNBC as a badge of honor.""

WATCH HERE
Tim ScottSunday Night In AmericaJuly 9, 2023
Trey Gowdy: The polling indicates Americans are down on the country, down on one another, down on the values we used to subscribe to, part of me doesn't blame folks for being pessimistic. When it's all you see and hear, you tend to believe it's all that exists. But what do you make of the polling and the state of the soul of our country?
Tim Scott: Trey, there are a lot of questions that we need to answer, and thank you so much for having me on your show. I would say one of the reasons why I'm running for president is because I understand the answer to this question. We have a lot of reasons to be optimistic about our future and it does take some self-reflection. Three really important reasons why we should be optimistic about our future. The first one is based on the fact that our history proves time and time again that Americans are exceptional because we meet our biggest obstacles by creating opportunities out of them, whether it's the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Jim Crow South, we continue to overcome the obstacles. The second really important reason is that the people like me who grew up on the other side of the tracks, started with a miserable beginning. It was the American people, friends from different neighborhoods, from different races, from different income statuses, came together to help me take personal responsibility, looking in the mirror and taking responsibility for my future. And the third reason why we should be really optimistic about where we're going as a nation is because America was founded upon Judeo-Christian values. Those principles continue to produce the greatest system, the greatest reason for hope in all of the universe, the reason why I consistently talk about Ephesians 3:20, that God is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above all that we ask or imagine. But Trey you know it and I know it, that today there is an entire industry built on grievance and victimhood. The progressive Left continues to sell us that it is somebody else's problem, that you have nothing to do with your condition, that America's a declining racist country, that is a lie from the pit of Hell. There's nothing further from the truth than that. So it's time for us, those of us who believe in the future of America, to stand up and to fight for the future of this nation and to win, and we have to win by persuading people that we're right.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Hauls in Nearly $16M Since Launching GOP Presidential Campaign in February,2023-07-10T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-hauls-nearly-16m-since-launching-gop-presidential,"
Fox News by Paul Steinhauser
Nikki Haley's Republican presidential campaign and two aligned political committees brought in $7.3 million during the April-June second quarter of 2023 fundraising, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.
Additionally, Haley's campaign highlights that the former two-term South Carolina governor, who later served as ambassador to the United Nations in then-President Trump's administration, has hauled in $15.6 million across all three of her fundraising committees since declaring her candidacy for the White House in February.
The filings, which were shared first with Fox News on Monday, indicate that Haley's campaign raked in $5.3 million the past three months, which includes a roughly $1 million transfer from Team Stand for America, her joint fundraising committee, which reports raising $2.6 million during the second quarter. Haley's leadership political action committee, Stand for America, listed $357,000 in receipts in its filing.
Stand for America Fund, Inc. – the super PAC supporting Haley's presidential run – in a separate announcement told Fox News that they've hauled in $18.7 million in fundraising during the second quarter.
Haley's campaign spotlighted that they have received 159,178 donations, with the vast majority of those contributions under $200, in a sign of the candidate's grassroots appeal.
""Nikki is grateful for the groundswell of support from more than 150,000 donations from all 50 states. Voters want their next president to take on China, speak out against socialism at home and abroad, and provide a vision for a strong and proud America,"" Haley campaign communications director Nachama Soloveichik said in a statement.
The campaign reiterated that they had well over the 40,000 individual donations required by the Republican National Committee as one of its thresholds for candidates to make the stage at the first GOP presidential nomination debate. The showdown will be hosted by Fox News and held in Milwaukee on August 23.
The campaign also showcased that they had $9.3 million cash on hand in their coffers at the end of June.
Stand For America Fund, Inc. told Fox News that they had $17 million cash on hand.
""Voters all across America are standing alongside Governor Haley in the fight to take back our country from Joe Biden and the radical left, and we couldn't be happier with the level of support we've received thus far. Every dollar gets us one step closer to winning in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada,"" Mark Harris, the super PAC's lead strategist, said in a statement.
While impressive, Haley's fundraising is significantly less that the $35 million in fundraising Trump's team says that the former president's campaign and Save America, his political action committee, raised the past three months combined. Trump's massive haul appears to be an indicator that the former president's mounting legal troubles have helped fuel his 2024 White House campaign.
During the second quarter of fundraising this year, Trump become the first sitting or former president in U.S. history to be charged with a crime, as he was indicted and arraigned New York City by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office in April and again in June in federal court in Miami.
Trump remains the commanding front-runner in the latest Republican presidential primary polls, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place, trailing the former president by double digits, and Haley and the rest of the large field of candidates in the single digits.
As Fox News first reported on Thursday, DeSantis reported raising $20 million from his campaign launch in late May through the end of June. And Never Back Down, the super PAC supporting the Florida governor's presidential run, in a separate announcement told Fox News that they hauled in $130 million in fundraising since the committee launched in early March.
Candidates have until July 15 to file reports with the Federal Election Commission.
Fundraising, along with polling, is a key metric to gauge a candidate's popularity and a campaign's strength. The money raised can be used for travel, ads, and to build voter outreach efforts.

"Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott: Democrats' Victim Mentality Is ""Hogwash""",2023-07-10T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-democrats-victim-mentality-hogwash,"
CHARLESTON, SC –  Today, Tim Scott joined Fox News'America Reports to discuss his 2024 presidential campaign.
WATCH HERE
Tim ScottAmerica ReportsJuly 10, 2023
John Roberts: So one of the hallmarks of your campaign is that you're taking on the Democrats' victim mentality, head on, but there are a lot of people on the left who say that this idea of up from the bootstraps, which you promote, that everybody could do it if they work hard enough, really is ignoring the basic racial history of this country. What do you say to those criticisms?
Sen Scott: Just one word: hogwash. It's the simplest word I can use. It's just hogwash. The truth of my life disproves the lies of the radical Left. What they hate the most is a candidate like me who actually disrupts their narrative. I'm a kid that grew up in a single parent household, mired in poverty, and because of American exceptionalism, good people, teachers, Chick-fil-A owners, came together to help me understand that if I took individual responsibility for myself, amazing things could happen. But here's the good news. It's not just my life. There are millions upon millions of Americans who started on one side of the tracks and they're now on the other side of the tracks. The great news of America's future is that it's not the color of your skin, it's the quality of your education. And that's one of the reasons why as president of the United States, I will encourage every state to embrace and adopt school choice programs and then take the two major buckets of money from the federal government, Title I and Title II, and send them with the kid. Wherever the kid goes, the dollars should follow. We can change the future of this country. And it starts with our education system. It's time for the GOP, the Great Opportunity Party, to be serious about education.

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Governor DeSantis on The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show: ""Bidenomics basically means you pay more for everything... ultimately to the benefit of places like Communist China""",2023-07-10T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-governor-desantis-the-clay-travis-and-buck-sexton,"
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Today, Ron DeSantis joined The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. See the highlights below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
On Bidenomics:
Bidenomics basically means you pay more for everything, and your standard of living goes down, ultimately to the benefit of places like Communist China. It's important to identify where all this goes back to. You know, the root of this was the COVID lockdowns and the Fauci-ism, and then they did the massive $2 trillion spending plan, spending $2 trillion in March of 2020. You had a massive printing of money by the Federal Reserve. Then December of 2020, another $2.2 trillion, then March of 2021, Biden did $2 trillion, and they've done more and more and more. You cannot inject that much borrowing, printing and spending into the economy and not have persistent inflation. They were warned about doing this. And yet they barrel ahead with it anyways. This has really been a government-induced economic problem, a crisis in terms of affordability.
On defending the innocence of children from woke corporations:
What made Disney kind of the All-American company under Walt and beyond was a focus on family, focus on traditional pro-American values. They would never have wanted to sexualize children the way Disney has. So they just have to look in the mirror [and] understand, first of all, it's wrong. Second of all, people aren't buying this, and it is ultimately to the detriment of the company. It's in the best interest of Disney shareholders that they get refocused on their previous core mission and get the woke out of there. And it goes beyond that [when] you start talking about kids. Because some of the woke in society is kind of annoying, and sometimes you just kind of roll your eyes. When you start talking about our kids, that's when parents really, really rise up in response. And I think it's sad that that's the case, but they have knowingly chosen to go down this road. And I can tell you in Florida, we're one of the few places where we've stood up to these woke companies in defense of parents and children. I get criticized by a lot of Republicans for having done that, but I'll tell you, I would do it again and it was the right thing to do.
On Big Tech censorship:
We will make it very clear that as President, when you're working with tech companies to try to stifle dissent, you are abusing your power, and you are infringing on the Constitutional rights of American citizens, and you will be shown the door. You have got to start firing these malevolent bureaucrats. You can't just let them continue to take more and more of our freedom. And I agree, this is a fundamental issue because the left ultimately wants to dominate every institution in this country and they've dominated a lot of them up to this point, not in Florida because we fought back, but across the country, and they want to impose an orthodoxy. Back during COVID, if you posted an article in those early days criticizing lockdowns, tech companies would pull it down. We had one of our YouTube videos - I had a panel of eminent scientists, people like Dr. Bhattacharya from Stanford, early on in COVID saying kids needed to be in school, that they should not be forced to mask. Google and YouTube took that video down. There was a concerted effort to use massive amounts of power, both corporate and government, to impose an official narrative on the country. And first of all, that's just not what a free society is all about. But also, as you guys know, the official narrative coming out of our elites is almost always wrong, and it's almost always destructive to a healthy society.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Inside Nikki Haley's Quest to be America's Iron Lady,2023-07-10T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-inside-nikki-haleys-quest-be-americas-iron-lady,"
New York Post by Ryan King
LITTLETON, N.H. — When Nikki Haley looks at America, she sees a nation full of self-loathing as its debt skyrockets and a belligerent China emerges as a threat to its pre-eminence.
In her eyes, the US is in a rut that requires an iron will to snap out of.
""I think America needs a woman of steel like no other,"" Haley, 51, told The Post from a hotel in this town of 6,000 just across the Connecticut River from Vermont.
""They need someone who's going to tell them the truth,"" she added. ""They need someone who's going to make the hard decisions.""
To Haley's supporters, this bleak assessment of American in 2023 is no accident, but meant to recall a very different time and place: Great Britain, circa 1979.
""It is my great pleasure to introduce to you who I believe is America's Iron Lady, Ambassador Nikki Haley,"" Kim Rice, former Speaker pro tempore of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, proclaimed at a VFW post in nearby Lancaster Friday as a storm brewed outside.
Haley is a heavy underdog in the dozen-strong 2024 GOP race, dominated by former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
But as the sole woman in the Republican field, the most diverse in the party's 169-year-history, comparisons to conservative icon and late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are intuitive to some of her backers.
""I see her as someone I want my daughters and my granddaughter to look up to, to aspire to be like. She is a formidable leader,"" Rice told The Post. ""No one should underestimate her.""
Like many Republicans, Haley has bristled at identity politics and the purported culture of victimhood in America
Simultaneously, she is quick to remind voters about her upbringing as a ""proud daughter of Indian immigrants"" and how she grappled with that while coming of age in South Carolina only a few years after the height of the Civil Rights Movement.
""We have to end this national self-loathing that has taken over our country,"" she frequently told attendees during her recent stops in the Granite State, noting that her home state made her the first minority female governor in the country back in 2010. ""America is not racist, we're blessed.""
Haley's supporters –and even some undecided voters — make no secret of their desire for the first female president to be a conservative woman.
""She's still dealing with a man's world. She needs support of more men,"" undecided voter Carolyn Grant, 76, told The Post following a meet and greet with Haley at a bakery in Lincoln, in the heart of the White Mountains.
Haley herself has cultivated a Thatcher-like image, at least superficially. Before she officially launched her campaign back in February, Haley paid homage to the former PM in a 2024 Twitter tease and wrote fondly of the British stateswoman (who died in 2013) in her book, ""If You Want Something Done: Leadership Lessons from Bold Women."" (Even the title is a take off on one of Thatcher's most memorable quotes: ""If you want someone to make a speech, ask a man; if you want to get something done, ask a woman."")
Similar to the Iron Lady's consistent anti-Soviet stance, Haley has trafficked heavily in stark rhetoric about foreign threats on the campaign trail, a throwback to her time representing America as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.
""China has been preparing for war with the United States for a long time,"" she warned during some of her stump speeches in northern New Hampshire. ""That's not being dramatic. This is the biggest threat we've had since Pearl Harbor.""
""I think she is very experienced in foreign policy. I think she has the right exact position on China,"" said 33-year-old Dhruv Nandamudi of Pittsburg, N.H., who brought his wife, baby, and dog to Haley's Lancaster town hall.
""No candidate is perfect, but specifically on her foreign policy, I think she was as good as it gets,"" he concluded.
Despite her emphasis on Beijing, Haley pointedly stops short of describing the US rivalry with China as a new Cold War.
""People put too much emphasis on terminology. I see it more as infiltration,"" she told The Post, underscoring Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambition to ""own the data.""
""You can't negotiate with dictators; you can't negotiate with thugs that want to take over the West and want to take over our country,"" she said. ""Instead, what you can do is be strong and show them that we're prepared to defend ourselves.""
But foreign policy isn't everything in politics.
Nandamudi, who said he is still exploring candidates, was critical of Haley for not being more committed to pro-life policies or reforming the Justice Department — a favorite topic of Republican primary voters post-Trump.
In addition, not all of Haley's target audience are fond of hardline approaches in the global arena. Some have been weary of getting entangled in foreign conflicts and railed against the so-called ""neocons"" thought to have been behind the drive to invade Iraq a generation ago.
A sizable number of Republicans in Congress have taken issue with the burgeoning price tag of stockpiling Ukraine with weapons in its efforts to stave off Russian aggressors. The GOP 2024 frontrunner, Trump, only speaks about the war in Europe to promise he'll end it within 24 hours of taking office. DeSantis, meanwhile, caused a firestorm in March by referring to the conflict as a ""territorial dispute.""
Haley, by contrast, has unwaveringly stood by the Kyiv government.
""Winning in Ukraine matters so much because it will be used as a deterrent for China going [and] invading Taiwan. Right now, they're watching everything,"" she said.
Fiscal conservatismIn addition to echoing Thatcher's call for strength abroad, Haley is also mirroring her pleas for fiscal restraint at home, a perpetual rallying cry for conservatives.
""We are $32 trillion in debt,"" Haley lamented to a not-quite-full gymnasium in the ski town of North Conway.
""It would be easy for me to tell you that Biden did that to us,"" she added. ""Our Republicans did that to us.""
Haley is quick to recite what she considers the past fiscal sins of the GOP, such as the greenlighting of COVID-19 relief measures ""without any accountability,"" and touts her pre-politics life as an accountant.
Haley has not shied away from calls for entitlement reform in her pitch for restoring financial order to the country, a bone of contention for some Republicans like Trump, who has warned the congressional wing of the party not to cut ""a single penny"" from Social Security or Medicare.
""The main thing is she won't lie to you,"" said 82-year-old Marie Gray, a volunteer at the meet-and-greet session in Lincoln who was clad in a Haley t-shirt. ""You may not like what she says, but she'll tell you the truth.""
Like many who support Haley (or are at least intrigued by her), Gray is deeply reticent about a third consecutive Trump nomination, especially in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol.
Game plan for victoryThe RealClearPolitics polling average of the 2024 Republican race shows Haley in a distant fourth place with 3.6% support — behind Trump (53%), DeSantis (20.9%) and former Vice President Mike Pence (6.1%) and just ahead of in-state rival Sen. Tim Scott (3.3%).
With almost exactly six months to go before the Iowa caucuses, Haley is running short on time to make up ground. But both the candidate and her campaign insist that she is right where she wants to be.
""This is a marathon. It's not a sprint,"" Haley stressed at the Lancaster town hall Friday. "" In July of 2015, Ted Cruz went to Iowa with 4%. In November, he had 10%. In January, he won the Iowa caucuses with 28%.""
To win the party nod, Haley is betting big on retail politics, repeatedly criss-crossing the first two voting states. Last week's events brought her count of New Hampshire showings to 39, and made her the second Republican candidate after Vivek Ramaswamy to hit up the Granite State's North Country — often overlooked by candidates in favor of the major cities of Manchester, Nashua and Concord along Interstate 93 north of Boston.
During these grassroots events, Haley tries to charm voters with her southern warmth and low-key demeanor.
In sharp contrast to Trump's rhetorical carpet-bombing, and DeSantis' take-no-prisoners culture war stances, Haley tends to pick less high-profile public fights.
""I think Republicans have gotten so used to fighting, that they're forgetting that we win by having numbers. We don't win by the loudest voice, we win by having more people with us than against us,"" she told The Post.
Haley's attention to less populous areas was noted by Jeb Bradley, the president of the New Hampshire state Senate and a frequent presence at many campaign events, though he has yet to endorse.
""Obviously, there's a long ways to go here and in the national polls, but [she's] somebody I think New Hampshire voters will look at pretty carefully,"" he told The Post, praising her ""positive message.""
There's also a lot of money to raise. Haley has reached the funding benchmark to qualify for the first Republican debate in Milwaukee next month, but her campaign has yet to announce her intake for the second quarter of this year — the first full three-month period of her campaign. Trump and DeSantis laid down early markers, with the former president saying his joint fundraising committee had taken in $35 million between April 1 and June 30, while DeSantis revealed his campaign alone had raised $20 million since his late-May entry in the race.

Pence Campaign Press Release - Mike Pence 2024 Announces Indiana Leadership Team,2023-07-09T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-mike-pence-2024-announces-indiana-leadership-team,"
Mike Pence today received additional support from Indiana conservatives in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Governor Eric Holcomb, who endorsed Pence last week, will chair the Indiana leadership team, which includes:

Indiana Speaker of the House Todd Huston (Co-Chairman);
Congressman Greg Pence; and
Congressman Larry Bucshon, M.D.

""Karen and I are truly humbled by the home team's belief in our campaign,"" said Mike Pence. ""Together, with these top conservative leaders of the Hoosier State, we have fought to cut taxes, advance for pro-growth policies to enhance employment, expand school choice, and stood for the right to life.""
""I've known Mike Pence for decades. Throughout those years, he's remained as honest as the day is long. Never once has he sacrificed an ounce of integrity in service to our state and nation. Mike's long been known to be forthright on the issues of the day, convicted in thought, and a consistent messenger regarding America's role, at home and abroad, as a powerful force for good,"" said Governor Eric Holcomb.
""I am proud to endorse Mike Pence for President. He is a proven, conservative leader who will utilize his experiences as a Congressman, Governor, and Vice President to rebuild America. He will be ready on the first day in office to solve the problems facing our country with the character and demeanor so desperately needed in today's politics,"" said Speaker of the House Todd Huston.
""Mike Pence is a man of integrity and courage. This is the man I have known since he was born. Our country needs a man with his character now more than ever. Mike Pence has never abandoned his post, or the Constitution and he never will. He will face every challenge, as he has in the past, with thoughtful and reasoned calm. Our politics have become too divisive, but Mike is an exception to the confused vitriol in today's politics. Mike Pence is the right man to unite our nation,"" said Congressman Greg Pence.
""Congressman, Governor, and Vice President and citizen: Mike Pence is supremely qualified for the job of President. Husband, father, and a man of deep faith: Mike Pence is prepared to be the moral and spiritual leader of our nation. It is with great honor and without reservation that I endorse Mike Pence to be the next President of the United States,"" added Congressman Larry Bucshon.

AXIOS – Pence's McCain moment
Former Vice President Mike Pence was confronted at an event in Iowa last night by an angry voter who claimed his actions on Jan. 6, 2021 — when Pence presided over the joint session of Congress certifying Biden's victory — are the reason Trump is no longer in office.
What they're saying: ""The Constitution affords no authority — to the vice president or anyone else — to reject votes or return votes to the states,"" Pence, a long shot to win a GOP primary dominated by his former boss, patiently explained.""Never been done before, should never be done in the future. I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's actually what the Constitution says.""""And I want to tell you, with all due respect ... President Trump was wrong about my authority that day, and he's still wrong,"" Pence concluded.Flashback: Pence's response drew comparisons to a powerful moment on the campaign trail in 2008, when then-Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) shut down a voter who said she couldn't trust Barack Obama because he was ""an Arab.""""No, ma'am,"" McCain said as he grabbed the microphone, cutting the woman off.""He's a decent family man, citizen that just I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what the campaign's all about.""

…
He said all the right things.  He has years of experience so that is the least we would expect.  But it was not a fake or a purely memorized presentation of himself.  He did give a short intro of his life, but quickly transitioned to a question and answer period.
He said he was going to shake every single person's hand in the room.  He did.
…
This is a man and campaign I can get behind.  Will he be the one?  It's still way to early for that decision.  But he has certainly not been ruled out.

Mike Pence says Iowa will be key to his chances of becoming president. Pence launched his presidential campaign in Iowa in June, and on Wednesday in Le Mars, the former vice president said he must do well in the Hawkeye State in the 2024 Republican Caucuses to remain a viable candidate. ""I think we need to do well in Iowa,"" Pence said during a meet-and-greet event at Wells Visitor Center & Ice Cream Parlor in downtown Le Mars. ""We're going to work our hearts out."" Later, in a one-on-one interview with The Le Mars Sentinel, he repeatedly said Iowa is a priority for him. Pence said he and his wife Karen, who accompanied him on Wednesday, will be in Iowa many times before the caucuses. It reminds him of his home state, he said, with its focus on faith, family and freedom, and he hopes that helps him forge a connection with Iowa Republicans.

… ""One of the things I've learned traveling the nation over the last two years is that I'm well known, but I don't think we're known well,"" Pence said early this morning.
""Most Americans know me as a loyal lieutenant standing beside the president right up until my oath to the Constitution required me to do otherwise, but the story of our family, the story of our service, the story of a family that's lived the American dream, that I've been a champion of the conservative movement all my life — that's a story I'll look forward to telling on the debate stage and in all 99 counties of Iowa before we get to that Caucus.""…

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Sunday Morning Futures: ""All of the Biden bureaucratic regulations will be tossed out. We are going to rip it all out.""",2023-07-09T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-sunday-morning-futures-all-the-biden,"
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis joined Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures. See the highlights below.
Watch the interview HERE.
On reversing Bidenomics:
""I have no interest in managing the decline of this country. I want to reverse the decline. I think Bidenomics really harkens back to the late 1970s. In the malaise of the Jimmy Carter era, people were talking about there was an era of limits, people just needed to be willing to make do with less and Ronald Reagan said, no, that is not acceptable, we can do better. And I think we are in a similar situation here. Bidenomics, at the end of the day, means you pay more for everything, your standard of living declines, you have less freedom, but the government has much more power. They want to wield that power over the economy to advance a very liberal political agenda. You also see how this breeds corruption because you gotta bend the knee to be able to qualify for all these different programs, and it really empowers corporations who want to side with the regime. I think it fundamentally needs to be tossed out and I think we need to put our country on a much different path. For one thing, we need to stop spending so much money. You look at the last three plus years this government has borrowed, printed, and spent trillions and trillions of dollars. You go back to the COVID lockdowns, that really represented the biggest transfer of wealth from middle-class people to big corporations like Amazon and Apple that we have ever seen in American history. That really laid the seeds for the inflation that we are seeing. You have to get spending under control. You have to open up American domestic energy production. We have an abundance of resources. Stop doing the Green New Deal, and let's get serious about producing more oil and gas. You also have to bring this administrative state to heel, the bureaucracy in Washington is totally out of control. It is exerting power that is not therefore under the Constitution, and we need a President to come in and really, really clean house and I will do that on day one. And finally, I think we need to recognize this experiment with the CCP over the last three decades where they were granted ""most favored nation"" status put in the World Trade Organization, you know that has been a failure. We need independence from China. We cannot subcontract out key aspects of our industrial base to a country that does not have our interests at heart and that is our number one geopolitical threat, and we will get that done as well.""
On countering communist China by revoking their most favored nation status:
""I think we are doing that. We probably need Congress, but I would take executive action as appropriate to be able to move us in that direction. Two, I would recognize that China is a threat. This idea of the happy talk that you hear from Yellen, it's a healthy competition. No, they're the number one geopolitical threat this country faces. And what we're going to do is, we are going to have a new commitment to hard power in the Indo-Pacific. The end of the day, what China respects is strength. And if you're showing strength and we have hard power to back it up, they're going to be much less aggressive. And my fear is under Biden is his weakness is really inviting China to do more, not just in their own theater, we see them doing more in our own hemisphere, here in the West. And so there will be a new day on day one. We are going to recognize the threat for what it is and we're going to take appropriate action.""
On reviving economic growth:
""All of the Biden bureaucratic regulations will be tossed out. We are going to rip it all out. The Green New Deal, all these things they have done are bad for growth and we are going to curtail that. If you look at the agencies, Maria, the agencies and government have grown 50% since 2019. Is there any American that's somehow better off as a result of that? No, it's causing a negative impact. So, we are going to do that.""
On fixing the education system:
""We need to reorient our education system. We need to stop producing degrees and things like zombie studies, where kids are going $100,000 in debt, and focus on more concrete skills that can be used in advanced manufacturing as we work to recapture and build a better industrial base. We have done that in Florida. We have doubled apprenticeships. We have created programs in our state colleges, so people don't have to go into debt; they can actually get concrete skills and be put in. When you increase productivity -- that is one of the best things you can do to drive down inflation, but it really starts with the education system. We need less woke indoctrination, and we need more tangible real-world skills applied.""
On Mamas for DeSantis:
""We've had incredible support in the early states, building an organization, signing up the key people that you need to be able to compete in a place like Iowa. We just launched our Mamas movement. My wife was in Iowa with Governor Kim Reynolds launching that. Parents, and particularly moms, I think are going to be the secret weapon both in this primary and in the general election. Nobody has been a better champion for those folks than me.""

Thank you, thanks so much. Great to see you. Great to be in Miami-Dade County. Thanks to the chairman, Alex Rizo. Thanks to all the other elected officials. I saw Danny Perez. I saw Ana Maria. I saw some school board members, so appreciate everything you all have done. It is exciting to say that we are here in a Republican county of Miami-Dade.
I don't know that there is a county larger than Miami-Dade in this country that would be considered a Republican county at this point. I was at the dinner last year when we were doing it, when René García was chairman. And there was buzz in the air about, this is what we need to do, we need to win Miami-Dade county. And honestly, I mean, you all know, if you even come close in a statewide race as Republican, you're going to win statewide, of course. Same with Palm Beach, you know, Broward, you try to mitigate the damage it can do.
So to even be competitive was a win. But we knew that we could actually win it. And we started working on the school board races, to be able to flip seats on the school board. And we now have probably, for an urban district, the best school board in the country here in Dade given the size.
And I know there's going to be more work done on that. And that was in August, and then we came to November, and we knew we were going to do it. We knew we were going to do it because people recognize the success that we've had in the state of Florida. They've recognized and appreciated living in a free state, unlike many other places around the country.
And they saw that leadership matters. And so we were very confident we were going to win the county. But I'll tell you, not only did we win the county, our ticket carried Miami-Dade County by double digits. No one would have predicted that before the election.
And not only that, so we won Dade, I think it was 11 or 12%, which was huge, [but] we also won Palm Beach County, which nobody was thinking about. We were thinking about it, [and] we knew we could do it a little closer than here. Very difficult. And we made really good gains in Broward, believe it or not. Broward used to be like a 70-30 county; we shaved the margin in Broward to 14 or 15%, which is a huge, huge win for Republicans. It used to be that in Florida politics, Democrats would get killed in the rural areas, they'd get killed in southwest Florida, Panhandle, Northeast Florida, you kind of would fight over the center of the state, Tampa and Orlando, across that region. But South Florida is where the Democrats would get big margins: Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach counties. They would get that margin and we just had to figure out a way to mitigate it in other parts of the state.
Well for the 2022 election, if you add up all the votes cast combined in Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami Dade, the Democrats didn't get any margin, we actually won South Florida outright. And that's the first time that's been done in a long, long time.
So job well done. I know a lot of people worked really hard for that. And it's especially important to note this success given how poorly Republicans did around the rest of the country. This was supposed to be a big red wave because you have a president in office who doesn't know which way is east and west and has a very difficult time, you know, getting-- I don't even know, like this cocaine in the White House. I mean I knew Biden was blowing a lot of issues. I didn't think it was quite that literal.
But was it Hunter's? Does everyone think it's Hunter's cocaine? Whose cocaine was it?
I can tell you this. If that were a Republican White House, man, you'd have a special counsel appointed. They'd want to know who the fingerprints—they'd know everything. Now there's 'Oh we were never going to be able to figure out you know, you know what's going on.'
But I think people rightly expected in a midterm election with a failed president- when inflation was 8, 9%, people thought the country was going in the wrong direction. They had a low opinion of Biden. We as Republicans should have been able to do nothing and gain, just given that environment. And yet, across the country, we saw Republican candidates lose very winnable races, that not only was there not a red wave, we actually lost seats in the US Senate. And we won the US House, but barely. And that should have been a tsunami. And so what we did in Florida, it was a true wave. It was a tsunami. What we did in Florida, we didn't have everyone around the country helping. We did it ourselves.
And so I think it's important because this is what we need to start doing throughout the rest of this country. Because I can tell you, I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish in Florida. I'm proud of being a Floridian, and people are proud to be Floridians now--more so than any time in my lifetime. We've got a sense of State pride. People like the fact that we bucked people like Dr. Fauci and made sure that the state was open and kids were in school. And all in all, down the line, people are excited about that. So it's great. And we've been able to do a lot.
But I'll tell you, if you look at what's going on with Biden and the left, they are intent on destroying the United States of America. And I think that if they're able to win in '24, and if we have another disappointing election, like we did in 2022, Katy bar the door because they're playing for keeps. If they win in '24 across the board, they will pack the US Supreme Court. They will add new judges, they will add liberal judges, and they will erase our conservative majority from the US Supreme Court just like that. They will try to make Washington, DC a state, so they get two left-wing, Democrat senators elected basically for life. They will abolish the electoral college. And they will eliminate voter ID in every jurisdiction in this country, and most likely mandate ballot harvesting in every jurisdiction in this country.
Now I can tell you, whatever you think of that agenda, and I don't think very highly of it, I'd imagine if you're sitting in this room you don't either. But it's a fact of the matter. The average American family is not sitting around their dinner table, saying, oh, man, I wish we could just get rid of voter ID. No, they're worried about crime and inflation and education and all these important issues. And so that's not an agenda that's speaking to the average American, that's an agenda where the left is trying to ensconce themselves in power for a generation. And if they're able to do that, it's going to take us a generation to be able to dig out of the hole that they will have dug for us. And this all goes to fundamental issues that are going to affect all of our daily lives. I mean, just think of what we've done in Florida, with respect to recognizing and protecting the idea that the purpose of our school system is to educate kids not to indoctrinate kids.
The Left believes that parents should just butt out of education, that you don't have a right to know what's going on in school, and they believe that because they think if the parents are involved that represents a roadblock for them using the school system to indoctrinate with their ideology. So they reject things like we've done in Florida, like a Parent's Bill of Rights. They want to impose ideology to teach kids to hate our country, to hate each other. Really, really sick stuff. And if you look at patriotism amongst young people right now, it's like 12% amongst people that are under 18. And I think that's by design. I think that that's a concerted effort to try to cause people to not like the foundations of this country. So they want to do that.
We stood against that in Florida. We say you, as a parent, have a right to know what curriculum is being used in your kid's school. It is sad to say, but it's true, that they have put pornography in the schools. You have a fifth grader that's reading this stuff. And it's too graphic to even discuss at a school board meeting- that's wrong. In fact, they'll accuse Florida of ""banning books,"" because we remove pornography from classrooms and school libraries. No one's banning anything, you guys can get whatever you want. But what is appropriate to be in school and what's not? And I can tell you this, we did an event to highlight what the parents had objected to across Florida. And we showed pictures on the video screen about what it was they were objecting to at the press conference. The new stations that were covering that, they had to cut their feed because they said it was too graphic to air on TV. Well, if it's too graphic for the six o'clock news, how is it okay for a 10-year-old school child?
So we believe that parents have the fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their kids. And that means things like curriculum transparency, it also means choosing the school of your choice. And thanks to the legislature, we enacted universal education savings accounts, the largest expansion of school choice in American history just this year.
It also means, and when I look at the education issues, I think most of you know, my wife and I, we've got three young kids, six, five, and three. And this morning, actually my five-year-old son, it was his first- he had been playing T-ball. Now he's in pitch ball, where the coach pitches. He actually did really good because you know, we've been practicing, but we are parents. We kind of go through what other parents are having to go through. And we just believe that parents in this state and in this country should be able to send their kids to school, let them watch cartoons, just let them be kids, without having an agenda shoved down their throats. It is wrong to have things like gender ideology in the schools, where you're teaching a second grader, that they can choose a different gender or that their gender is a choice. That is wrong. And that does not have a place in the state of Florida because we stood up and made sure that we protected the rights of parents. And when we did that, the left was very upset about it because they want, especially in those early grades, that's where they really want to get in and do the agenda. So they were not happy with that. The media was not happy with it.
But I'll tell you parents in this state were happy that we stood up- not just Republicans, [but] Independents [and] Democrats. Kids need to be kids. And we've got to stop targeting our children letting them target are chosen. And you know, Biden, and the Left they say this, but Biden himself will say, 'you know, they're not just your kids, they're all of our kids.' Well, wait a minute. No, no, no, my kids are my kids. Okay, Joe, they're not your kids. And oh, by the way, you say that they're all of our kids, yet, you don't recognize your own granddaughter in Arkansas, thanks to Hunter, you pretend like she doesn't exist. Spare me this idea of all of our kids. But that's their view. And so we have a situation where we stand up against that. And you know, Disney didn't like it when we stood up against the gender ideology. But I didn't take an oath of office to support a woke corporation based in California, I took an oath to support the people of this state. And that's exactly what we did. So, this is a battle line. This is a battle line throughout our society, Florida has come down very strong. We have won the battle for now in favor of parents and students.
But I'll tell you, the left is pursuing this battle all across the country. And I think within the next decade, we as a society, are either going to go down the road of saying no parents are central, or we're going to go down the road like California, where they will go so far as to take away custody of your kid if you don't recognize a, ""gender transition"" of somebody who may be 12 years old. So that's the direction they want to go. That's the stakes of this battle. You also see the stakes of the battle with respect to the economy. What we did in Florida by fighting the lockdowns was very simple. The lockdowns caused the greatest transfer of wealth from working people to big companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, than it's ever happened in modern history.
In Florida, we guaranteed people had the right to work, and that businesses had the right to operate. Working people were able to do well here where they couldn't do it in California and these other places. What happened was, because all these other places were following Fauci for so long, you had the federal government, Congress- they spent and printed trillions and trillions of dollars, borrowed trillions and trillions of dollars. Of course, you're going to have inflation when that happens, that is textbook economics. So the inflation that we've seen has been induced by the federal government's own policies and so the people in DC, do better. Some of the other people in the economy that have certain assets may do better, but the average American does much worse as a result of those policies. Bidenomics means you pay more for the necessities of life, the government gets bigger, and China ends up benefiting. We need to rip Bidenomics up, root and branch, and throw it away.
But I'll tell you what they want to do. They have a vision on the economy, and it's basically to exert more control over your daily lives. That's why they're doing things like ESG, environment, and social governance. ESG is basically just window dressing for them to use the economy to be able to impose their agenda on us and agenda they couldn't get through the normal legislative process. And so in Florida, we kneecapped the ESG. It's not allowed in our pension system. And the banks aren't allowed to do social credit scores, which is what the left wants to do. And like they do in China, we also took action to protect Floridians against the imposition of a central bank digital currency, which they want to do. And if you don't know what that is, you should look it up. Because ultimately, the vision with these elites is to have a digital dollar, have a cashless society, not allow things like Bitcoin, and then they control every one of your financial transactions. And you have people in Davos, Switzerland, these elites who will say, 'Oh, yeah, once you do that, you can prevent, quote, problematic purchases, like gasoline or ammunition, whatever they don't want you to have,' they'll just say you can't do it. So it's a huge threat to freedom, we responded very quickly, I can tell you, January 20, 2025, I'll get into Washington, and we are ending CBDC once and for all. Don't worry about that.
But they want to control, and they want to go after our energy independence because that's a way that they can force people into things like electric vehicles. And if you want an electric vehicle, God bless you. But you should not be forced to do that. A lot of people can't even afford it. And who benefits when they have electric vehicle mandates? China benefits because they make most of the stuff that goes into these electric vehicles. So, we're going to unleash America's energy independence, our oil and our gas to make sure you have affordable, reliable energy. Because I can tell you when we have hurricanes come through Florida, one of the first things you do search and rescue, of course, all that, but the first thing after that is get the power back on. I didn't rely on windmills to get the power back on we need the traditional energy. That's what happens. So, we'll do that. And that'll be something that's very, very significant.
Another thing Biden is doing is he is so subservient to President Xi Jinping and the CCP. They're trying this policy of appeasement. Basically, they're trying to play, quote, ""nice with China,"" they say, 'Oh, well, you know, we're just kind of, you know, in a friendly competition with China,' let me tell you, the CCP is a threat to this country. They want to dominate this entire world; they want to dominate our economy even more than they already have. And if we don't get smart about this, both dealing with the nonsense that we have here at home with woke ideology, but also don't get serious about countering Chinese expansionism. 30 years from now, our kids are going to be learning to memorize 37 different pronouns in Mandarin. So, this is something that's very significant. And we're going to do, but that means having key things produced in the United States, like we need to, you can't rely on China for key things affecting ammunition, affecting pharmaceuticals, and affecting things that are really central to our national survival. So there'll be a new sheriff in town on January 20, 2025. And the CCP should just be prepared for that. And they already can look in Florida because we were right, I think we were the first state to say we're not allowing the CCP to buy land in the state of Florida. And that's the right thing to do.
But what motivates the Left is, you know, they are pursuing basically a religion. It's not a traditional religion as we would practice. But it's a religion based on leftist ideology. And I think the most recent iteration of this is this woke mind virus. But at the end of the day, what they're pursuing is a form of Cultural Marxism. They are waging a war on merit and a war on achievement. And they are trying to elevate identity politics as the most important thing in American life. They are in effect waging a war on truth itself. And because they're waging a war on truth, we have no other alternative but to wage a war on woke, and that's exactly what we've done in the state of Florida. We beat the woke in the schools, we beat the woke in the corporations, and we beat the woke in the halls of the legislature. There are some people that will say 'I you know, this woke stuff who really cares, I don't know, I don't like talking about it all this other stuff.' First of all, there is value in having your society rooted in the truth. I refuse to accept that a man can get pregnant because it's not true, but yet they want us to accept that. So there's value in just speaking the truth.
But even putting that aside, when woke, ideology infects institutions, it has an impact on your daily life. If things like ESG are allowed to take over our economy, the average person will become poor. As a result of that happening. When woke ideology overtakes our education system, the average student will be subjected to left-wing indoctrination, and they will become much dumber as a result of that, when woke ideology overtakes things like the criminal justice system, like we've seen in places like San Francisco, like we've seen in places like Los Angeles, the average citizen becomes less safe as a result of that. And you see these prosecutors who've been elected a lot of times with financial support from people like George Soros, and they get into office, they say, 'we're not going to enforce the law,' you can mug somebody, you can rob them, you can do all this stuff. And they basically let the criminals go. Well, crime goes up, society starts to break down into total disaster, when we had one of those prosecutors in Florida, who said he wasn't going to enforce laws [that] he didn't like, I removed him from his post, he is gone.
So woke is a fight. It's a fight, we need to win. We have done it in Florida, not only with what we've done by removing critical race theory from our schools, eliminating the so called ""DEI"" from our public universities, but also taking on the woke corporations. And here's the thing, these corporations, they are trying to impose leftism on this society, and they're doing it without any constitutional checks and balances. So, if you want a free society, you got to be sure, yeah, woke is in passing legislation. Of course not. But you also have to protect people's freedoms against this being jammed down their throat, in business, or in education, or in all these other aspects of American life. And that's what we've done in Florida, but this battle rages on throughout the country. And I think what we need to do over the next decade is leave woke ideology in the dustbin of history where it belongs. And we'll get that done.
And one of the things that flows from-- Look, I'm I was in the Navy, you know, I volunteered to serve after 9/11. We served in Iraq and served in a bunch of places. And it's something that I think when you wear the uniform of your country, when you serve alongside other patriots, and you're serving a cause greater than yourself, there's a lot of honor in that. There's a lot of satisfaction that you can derive from that because you're part of something that's meaningful. And I know a lot of veterans feel the same way. And yet, right now, I have veterans coming up to me saying I don't know that I'd recommend my son, daughter, or grandkids to join today's military. Why? Because they're promoting political agenda within the military. The Navy, sad to say, you know, they'll have drag queens to recruit people into the Navy. And I'm thinking to myself, What is going on here? So recruiting is at a generational low, morale is at a generational low. And I can tell you, you're not going to deter China, if you can't get good people to sign up for your military. So, first order of business January 20, 2025, rip the woke out of our nation's military and restore it back to its proper glory.
And I think about kind of the stakes that are in front of us and the battles ahead, Reagan used to say, 'freedom's only one generation away from extinction, it's not passed along in the bloodstream. It needs to be fought for, it needs to be cultivated.' And I agree with that. I used to think it was a little bit of an exaggeration. Because after all, we're Americans we have a Declaration of Independence, we have a Constitution. Isn't freedom just in our DNA? How could it actually be a generation away from extinction? But I think anybody that's lived through the last four or five years should appreciate just how fragile freedom really is in this country. And I know being in South Florida, we have a lot of people who understand the fragility of freedom because they've been in countries that have lost freedom. And this has been the place where people have come to. So freedom is fragile. Our founding fathers absolutely understood this.
When they went to Philadelphia in 1787, to create our Constitution, they came armed with having studied the history of every republic in all of human history, so that they can divine the lessons from what had happened in those prior Republic's. And what they found was that there was really only one thing that all these different Republic's had in common it was this, every one of them had failed. And so they understood it fell to the United States of America to determine, can people really govern themselves. Can you have a society based on the idea that our rights come from God, not from the government, that we live under a rule of law, not under the rule of individual men? Or was mankind forever destined to live under various forms of despotism? And they firmly expected this country would answer that question for all of human history. And when Benjamin Franklin walked out of the convention, he was asked, 'did you create a republic or a monarchy?' And Franklin said, 'a republic, if you can keep it.'
They understood that each generation would have to step up to the plate and defend freedom, and this is our generation's time to stand up when the chips are down in this country, and say, not on our watch, we are not going to let this great heritage of freedom be diminished. And I'm motivated to do this partially because I'm a dad with kids, I look forward to them growing up in a society that's prosperous, where they have opportunity. And I know many of you are concerned about your kids and grandkids, and we should be. But one of my motivations for fighting the fight is I understand there's been a lot of people throughout American history that have sacrificed so that we could be free.
I used to go up to Washington, DC and fly into Reagan airport. And one of the routes you could take going into Reagan airport, you would go flush parallel to the National Mall. So if you looked out the left side of the plane, you'd see really up close, jaw-dropping views of the Lincoln Memorial of the reflecting pool, the Washington Monument, and then out in the distance perched on top of a hill, the beautiful US Capitol building, and you feel a sense of pride because those monuments those buildings, they represent the ideals that this country has aspired to. But what I figured out after doing that trip a few times, the best monuments that we have to America, were actually not found outside the left side of the plane. Because if you looked out the right side of the plane, you looked over the Potomac River, you saw very small, nondescript monuments, orderly arranged over the rolling hills of a place called Arlington National Cemetery. And it occurred to me that, you know, you can have the best Declaration of Independence in the world, you can have the best constitution in the world. But if you don't have people that are willing to stand up, put on a uniform risked their lives and indeed give their lives in the last full measure of devotion for this country, then none of those documents, ideals, presidents, leaders, are going to amount to very much. This does not run on autopilot.
It does not run on autopilot and requires us to stand firm for the truth. A requires us to be resolute in defense of the enduring principles that have made this country what it is, and it requires us to have courage under fire. In this day and age with the left controlling the media, and tech, and entertainment, and even business and academia. When you stand for the truth, you will face consequences for that. And it could be a guy like me, who's a governor, you know, running, of course, I'm going to take arrows, I'm proud to take arrows, I'd rather take them so you don't have to.
But it's not just people like me, you could be a mother going to a school board meeting. If you're speaking the truth, do you think you're going to be treated well by the media? Do you think you're going to be treated well, by the left? No, they're going to come at you. They're going to attack you. And so freedom has a cost, preserving freedom has a cost. Leadership has a cost, and you got to be willing to stand your ground when you're in that cauldron, standing in the breach, and say you know what? I am not going to back down not one inch, here I stand, and I'm going to stand for the truth and if we do that over these next-- If we as Republicans just do that, over the next year and a half, then I think we're going to end up in a situation where we're going to have a very good election in 2024.
But here's the deal, we have developed, outside of Florida, and Iowa, and a couple other states, Republicans have developed a culture of losing where they lose winnable races. A lot of times there will be rationalizations for why you lose, there'll be recriminations. Meanwhile, the Democrats get in, and they continue their march towards more leftist government. The time for excuses is over. We're not getting a mulligan in the 2024 election. We've got to step up to the plate, and we have to get it done. And I know all of you are going to be in that fight. I am going to be in that fight. And I'll tell you, we're going to do for America, what we've been able to do for the state of Florida. God bless you all. Thank you. Thanks so much.

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: First Lady Casey DeSantis Launches Mamas for DeSantis, Garnering National Praise and Rave Reviews",2023-07-07T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-first-lady-casey-desantis-launches-mamas-for,"
JOHNSTON, Iowa — Yesterday, First Lady Casey DeSantis launched 'Mamas for DeSantis,' the largest movement of parents in our nation's political history. See the highlights from the launch event below.
Watch the event HERE.
On the inspiration behind Mamas for DeSantis:
""We are going to launch the largest mobilization of moms and grandmothers across the United States of America to protect the innocence of our children and to protect the rights of parents...never back down. And always stay true to what you believe in. Because at the end of the day, you look at yourself in the mirror, and you say, 'I did it right.' I wake up in the morning and I'm knowing I'm doing it for the right reasons- for our children and for our families.""
On Why Ron DeSantis is the fighter mamas should support:
""As long as I have breath in my body, I will go out and I will fight for Ron DeSantis. Not because he's my husband, that is part of it, but it's because I believe in him in every ounce of my being. If you want somebody to go up to Washington DC to clean house, to be able to put this country back on the trajectory where we are talking about our rights coming in from our Creator and our government being put in place to protect our rights that are ours- he is the man to do it.""
On her battle with cancer:
""There was a time in my life where I didn't know if I was going to see my kids graduate from kindergarten, let alone high school. I was able to beat that back and I had some really difficult, long battles. As a matter of fact, the Governor was getting criticized for doing this with me, but I remember every single chemotherapy appointment that I went to, and there were six of them, and they were long and very hard...and he held my hand during every single one of them and he never left my side. And I'll tell you what, when you go through something like that, and you're in the middle of the night scared, and you don't know what's going to happen and you crawl into bed with your kids, and you're getting hope for tomorrow that you can have some more time with them. And then you realize that God has given you more opportunity to be able to live. When you're given that opportunity in life, what do you do with it? Do I care what a headline says? No, I care about protecting the innocence of my children and your children's.""
On the importance of school choice and parental involvement:
""You should not be destined to the zip code that you live in for your opportunities to live up to your God-given potential. It should be up to the parents to decide what education they think is best for their children. And government should get out of the way. But what I've found is there's a nice competitive model. If you have charter schools, and you have homeschooling, and you have private schools and you have public schools, and there's a competition for students, you find everybody does well, because they're all wanting to compete. And at the end of the day, we're looking for the return on the investments of the students, we want them to be able to be happy, which is first and foremost, and productive in society.""
On protecting the innocence of children:
""The Governor passed something in Florida called curriculum transparency. Basically what that was, that enabled parents to be able to go to the schools to say, 'I want to see what curriculum you're teaching out kids.' And if they didn't give that information to the parent in a timely matter, then they had the right of action to be able to sue and it was also tied to the principal's teaching certificate. And what that led to was the discovery of pornography in a lot of these schools in their libraries and a lot of parents were really frustrated. I talked to other parents across the state whose children were being transitioned behind their back without their consent or their knowledge...and this isn't ok. In this time in society, it's not ok to take the rights of parents away from them.""
Earlier on Thursday, Florida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo and Virginia County mom Marienne Jenson joined the American Agenda to share why they proudly support 'Mamas for DeSantis.'
Watch the full interview HERE.
""Just look how good she is at getting her message across, how important it is for our citizens of our country to take back our conservative values, to raise our children the way we want to raise them,"" said Florida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo. ""She is the right person to do it. Because she has three young children, she cares deeply about our educational values. And I think she's going to come out in Iowa and she's going to promote those values. And she's going to do a bang up job. I am so proud to work with her in Florida. And I think she's going to do a great job around the country.""
""Moms will take back this country. Moms will get this country back on track. I'm excited to be a part of this,"" said Marienne Jenson. ""I saw what Governor DeSantis did down in Florida while I was here in Virginia, with our previous governor locking down our children from school and making our children wear masks. I saw what he was doing down there [in Florida] and I am so ready to throw my support behind him. But I know that Casey is the lead in this and mammas will support her and support Governor DeSantis.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Tom Davis: Nikki Haley is the Outsider America Needs,2023-07-07T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-tom-davis-nikki-haley-the-outsider-america-needs,"
The Post and Courier by Tom Davis
When I think about who the next president should be, one thing is immediately clear: We need an outsider, someone who's not afraid to buck the leaders in both parties, take on the hardest fights and figure out how to get things done in an environment that, too often, prizes political attacks over results.
South Carolina has a leader just like that. She's our former governor, Nikki Haley. She has the right values and vision. And she has my vote.
I've known Nikki for 20 years, and I had the privilege of serving alongside her in the General Assembly and supporting her as governor.
She's been an outsider since day one, and never, not once, has she given up and become an insider like almost every other politician.
Think about it. This is the leader who took on the longest-serving Republican incumbent in the state Legislature. He'd been there for 30 years, and he took the low road — which included making pejorative aspersions to her Indian American ethnicity and mocking her as a young mother with no political experience — to fight against her insurgent campaign. She won anyway, not by stooping to his level but by rising above it.
She did it again when she ran for governor, taking on much better-known names from the political establishment. She won that race, too.
A leader is only as good as the laws she gets passed, and on that note, Nikki took on the most outsider fight I can imagine.
She was furious when she learned that the General Assembly didn't cast most votes on the record, making it impossible to hold lawmakers accountable while greasing the skids for unaffordable spending. So she introduced legislation to end that practice and didn't back down — even when Republican Party leaders punished her for going against them.
As governor, Nikki Haley signed the law putting legislative votes on the record. She started that fight and saw it through, delivering a historic victory for transparency and accountability in South Carolina.
The best thing about outsiders is that once they win one fight, they don't just rest on their laurels. They move onto the next problem in need of fixing. Sure enough, Nikki cracked down on illegal immigration and took on Barack Obama when his administration protested. Early in her first term, Nikki signed one of the toughest immigration laws in the country, empowering law enforcement to check people's immigration status and mandating that employers use E-Verify.
She also signed laws to cut taxes, expand school choice, and protect our elections by enacting a voter ID law in South Carolina.
Like every South Carolinian, I was proud to see Nikki take her principled leadership to the United Nations in 2017.
And I couldn't have been more impressed with what she achieved. If you thought it was hard to stand up to the ""old boys"" club here at home, imagine standing strong in the face of every dictator and thug in the world.
What's more, imagine doing that while having to fight the D.C. bureaucracy every step of the way because the ""experts"" in Washington think they know better.
Through it all, Nikki stood for America with grit and grace, confronting China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
And all the while, she kept fighting to protect taxpayers like you and me, making sure we didn't fund all the bogus things they do at the United Nations.
Who else do you know who's taken on so many hard fights, stood up to so many entrenched elites and won so many victories along the way, all while doing it with a style and manner that don't turn people off?
Only a true outsider — someone who never stops fighting for what she knows is right.
Nikki Haley proved it as a lawmaker, governor and ambassador. She'll prove it again, and even more than before, as a president of the United States we can all be proud of.
Tom Davis represents Beaufort and Jasper counties in the S.C. Senate.

"Statement by Will Hurd: ""A Common-Sense Vision for America""",2023-07-07T00:00:00+00:00,Will Hurd,/documents/statement-will-hurd-common-sense-vision-for-america,"
Addressing the Challenges We Face in These Complicated Times
As we stand at the crossroads of history, the soul of our country is under attack. We are facing generational defining challenges.
Our enemies overseas plot, create chaos, and threaten the American dream. At home, we face challenges of illegal immigration, a growing drug crisis, stagnant inflation, growing crime, and persistent homelessness in our cities.
America needs to change course. America needs common-sense leadership in these complicated times.
President Biden can’t solve these problems – or won’t, and if the GOP makes the mistake of nominating a lawless, selfish, proven loser like Donald Trump then Joe Biden will win again in November 2024.
I am Will Hurd, and I am running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States of America.
My Background and Experience – National Security, Domestic Policy, Technology
For the past 20 years, I've been on the front lines of the most pressing fights facing our nation.
After the tragic events of 9/11, I was in the Middle East, hunting down terrorists and working to secure a safer world. It was an incredibly challenging time, but also a time that taught me the value of perseverance, the importance of clear-eyed strategy, and the power of American resolve.
In Congress, I fought to lower taxes, secure our border, and provide more opportunities for the middle class. I saw firsthand the impact of policy on everyday Americans, from the farmer in the Midwest to the small business owner in the South. I learned that when we prioritize the needs of the American people over partisan politics, we can achieve great things.
I've also worked at the highest levels of business, harnessing technology and innovation for the future of America. I've seen how artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other advanced technologies like synthetic biology can transform industries, create jobs, and drive economic growth.
My Dream for America
To have a United States of America where the American Dream is within reach for all, not just a select few we require a government that first, can protect us against external threats.
A Time of Unprecedented Peace
The Chinese Communist Party is trying to surpass the USA as the sole global superpower.
They are building a coalition of like-minded governments to achieve this aim. This will impact our economy. This will impact our kids’ ability to get good paying jobs.
This will impact how comfortable we will be when we retire. I dream of an America that ushers in a period of unprecedented peace because our armed forces and alliances are so strong they deter our enemies and grow our network of friends.
A Thriving Economy
For every American to move up the economic ladder, we need to empower people not the government.
I dream of an America where the economy thrives, because we harness technologies like artificial intelligence to grow American jobs, not unemployment.
World-Class Education Regardless of Age or Location
I dream of an America where we have the smartest kids in the world. Every child in the U.S., regardless of location or age, should have access to a safe, world-class education.
Education is the foundation of our future, the key to ensuring that every American can achieve their dreams. We must invest in our schools, support our teachers, and provide our children with the tools they need to succeed in the 21st century.
Safer Communities
I dream of an America where our cities are the envy of the world because they are not plagued by gun violence, increasing crime, growing drug problems, homelessness, or income inequality. To achieve this, we need to address not only the symptoms of these issues but get at their root causes.
This vision for America is not a given. It can only happen if we focus on our timeless principles and limitless potential, not self-interested politics. As President, I promise to put our American security and prosperity first.
I will provide the common-sense leadership America so desperately needs in these complicated times.
Republicans deserve better. America deserves better. It's common sense.
Choosing a New Direction
In this election, we have a choice.
We can continue down the path of divisive politics and short-term thinking, or we can choose a new direction. We can choose a future that is grounded in common sense, that prioritizes the needs of the American people, and that builds on our strengths as a nation.
Together, we can make this vision a reality. Together, we can create an America that thrives on innovation, that provides opportunities for all, and that leads the world not just in power, but in principle.
The Lessons Guiding My Journey – We Are Better Together
In this journey, I am guided by the lessons I've learned from my past experiences.
The courage I saw in the face of adversity overseas in dangerous places, the resilience of the American people I served in Congress, and the boundless potential I witnessed in the world of business.
These experiences have shaped me, and they have reinforced my belief in the indomitable spirit of America.
I am running for President because I believe in the promise of America. I believe in our shared values of freedom, justice, and equality. I believe in the American dream, and I am committed to ensuring that this dream is within reach for every American.
I believe we are better together.
Addressing the Pressing Issues
But to achieve this, we need to address the pressing issues that confront us. We need to secure our borders while ensuring that America remains a beacon of hope for those seeking a better life.
We need to tackle the drug problem that is ravaging our communities, and we need to ensure that our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.
We need to address the growing divide between the rich and the poor, and we need to ensure that every American has access to quality healthcare. We need to invest in our infrastructure, in our schools, and in our future.
And we need to do all this while maintaining fiscal responsibility and ensuring that our children and grandchildren are not burdened with debt.
Join the Journey for a Better America
These are not easy tasks, but I am ready to take them on. I am ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work for the American people. I am ready to lead with common sense, with integrity, and with a steadfast commitment to the American dream.
I invite you to join me in this journey. I can't do it alone. I need your help, your support, and your vote.
Let's bring common sense back to the White House. Let's work together to build a future that works for all Americans. Let's make our vision for America a reality.
I'm Will Hurd, I’m running for President, and I approve this message.

Tim ScottWake Up AmericaJuly 7, 2023
Rob Finnerty: Senator, you've been really vocal about the Fend Off Fentanyl Act, to get people off Fentanyl. I just want to know what you make of the fact that cocaine was found at the White House six days later in one of the most secure buildings in the country. We still apparently have no idea who brought it in there. What do you make of that?
Tim Scott: Well, I heard that they were going to conclude their investigation sometime soon. I have to say this, Rob, you have to start an investigation to conclude an investigation. Here's what we know today about the people's house, not Biden's White House, but our house today, it is not secure. You cannot have substance – What if it was anthrax? The security risk associated with not being able to find where the cocaine comes from is a problem. Think about the judgment that we're seeing out of the White House, whether it was during Pride month, topless women parading around the White House. And now cocaine sitting around and think about the most important quality that binds it all together, the lack of leadership. This president reminds us of the dereliction of duty that we see everyday, whether it is our southern border, whether it's the White House and cocaine, whether it's with China, whether it's crime in the middle of our streets, whether it's inflation that we can't afford. This president lacks leadership.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis joined Will Cain on Fox News Tonight. The highlights are below.
On Bidenomics:
Bidenomics in a nutshell is: you pay more for the necessities of life, your standard of living goes down, the government gets bigger and more powerful, and ultimately China will benefit from a lot of stuff. The reason why Florida has done good, leading in net-in migration, leading in new business formations – our unemployment rate is way lower than the national average – is because we have rejected Bidenomics. We govern conservatively. We don't spend our state into oblivion.
On his strong fundraising haul and his path to victory:
Did you just see the news today about the record fundraising haul we've had? Nobody has been able to match that in the history of modern presidential politics, so we've got a huge amount of support to be able to take the case to the people. We really have not started that yet, we are in the process of building out a great organization and I think we're going to be on the ground in all these early states. It is a three yards and a cloud of dust type situation, that is what we are going to be doing. At the end of the day, nobody has stood up for hardworking Americans more than I have over these last five years and delivered the level of results that I have. That is going to be a great story to tell because if we did it in Florida, we absolutely can do it as president. That will mean the border, the invasion stops, it will mean the economy's restored, and it is going to mean that woke ideology ends up in the dustbin of history.

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - DeSantis Posts Best First Fundraising Quarter of Any Non-Incumbent Republican Candidate in More Than a Decade, Raising $20 Million in Just Six Weeks",2023-07-06T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-desantis-posts-best-first-fundraising-quarter-any-non,"
DeSantis Surpasses What Trump Campaign Raised During Its First Two Fundraising Quarters in Race Combined
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The DeSantis for President campaign today announced that it raised $20 million in its first six weeks, reflecting the growing enthusiasm for Governor DeSantis' forward-looking vision for the Great American Comeback. The campaign's haul is the largest first-quarter filing from any non-incumbent Republican candidate in more than a decade. It bests the $18.3 million former president and quasi-incumbent Donald Trump's campaign raised during its first two fundraising quarters as a candidate ($3.8 in Q4 2022 and $14.5 in Q1 2023).
""Joe Biden's leftist policies are destroying the country, and Republicans are excited to invest in a winner ready to lead America's revival,"" said campaign manager Generra Peck. ""We are grateful for the investment so many Americans have made to get this country back on track. The fight to save it will be long and challenging, but we have built an operation to share the governor's message and mobilize the millions of people who support it. We are ready to win.""
The strong Q2 haul comes after DeSantis recently eclipsed 250 endorsements from state legislators across the nation and unveiled his plan to stop the invasion and secure the border. The policy rollout was the first of many the campaign has planned in the weeks and months ahead.

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Newsmax: ""We'll rip the woke out [out of the military] on day one""",2023-07-06T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-newsmax-well-rip-the-woke-out-out-the,"
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — In an interview on Newsmax this afternoon, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told Chris Salcedo that putting an end to wokeness in the military and securing the border are both ""day one"" issues. Governor DeSantis also discussed his take on the disastrous consequences of Bidenomics and shared his thoughts on the issue of cocaine being found in the White House.
Watch the interview HERE.
On the rise of wokeness in the U.S. military:
""I had the fortune of volunteering to serve in the Navy, serving in Iraq, serving alongside a lot of great patriots. Wearing the cloth of your country is something that's very meaningful to me, and I know for other veterans. And yet, for the first time in my life, I have veterans coming up to me all the time, saying, you know, I don't know that I'd want my kid or grandkid to join today's military because, exactly what you said, it's become a Petri dish for social experimentation. They're putting political fads over military readiness. Morale is in the tank, recruiting is at a generational low because people want to join a military that's mission focused. They don't want to join the military to be a cog in an overall social experiment. So we'll rip the woke out on day one. And here's the thing, China is absolutely a threat to us. Biden has been very weak on China, obviously, he's had financial dealings, his family's had, with them. So they're being very, very weak with respect to China. I would like to do more with our military to be able to combat China in the Pacific because I think we can deter them. However, you can't pour more resources into it until you fix the underlying culture. So that's a day one issue. There is going to be major changes in all the armed services when I become president. I can tell you this, veterans around the country are going to rally to that, and you're going to see people going to be more willing to sign up for the military as a result of getting us focused back to the basics.""
On securing the border as president:
""Day one as president we'll declare a national emergency, we'll mobilize all available resources, including the military, to stop the invasion at the southern border. Yes, we will construct the border wall because I think that that's important to have. But we're going to reestablish the sovereignty of this country. We are not going to allow bogus asylum claims to overrun our border like it's happened under Biden. And in terms of states, we're going to empower states to enforce immigration law. Texas is putting up barriers, they're putting up barbed wire because they're trying to defend their sovereignty. We have a federal government now that's opposing them doing that. I want the states and locals to be partners with us so we can enforce immigration law. But I think the thing that we're going to do that no one has been willing to do is recognize... I was actually down in Arizona a few weeks before we announced our plan, and I was in a place where we did have the border wall, there were major steel beams. This is really good stuff, right? Well, turns out the cartels will cut through the steel beams, smuggling product, and our federal government does nothing to stop them. And so what I've said is we're going to have rules of engagement on that border. If the cartels are cutting through our border wall to try to move product, that's going to be the last thing they do because they're going to end up stone cold dead. We are going to use force at the border to be able to defend the American people. And we are going to lean in against the cartels directly, not just in terms of what they're doing on the ground, but also interdicting the precursor chemicals to fentanyl that are being brought in by sea from China into these Mexican ports. So I think it requires an all hands on deck approach. At the end of the day, the thing that I saw down there that was, that stuck with me was just the humiliation that as an American, we don't even have control over our own country. We've ceded our border to Mexican drug cartels. That is pathetic. And that is not, I think, what the American people want.""
On the discovery of cocaine in the White House:
""What came to mind for me is, we've seen for over two years, the Biden administration blowing it on a whole host of issues. I guess this means that's a little bit even more literal than we had thought previously. But isn't it interesting how you have this cocaine there? I don't see the FBI and the DOJ mobilizing and doing like a real serious investigation of this. I kind of feel like if they were a Republican White House, that you'd have swarms of DEA and FBI agents trying to get to the bottom of who brought that into the White House. I think with this, they're just treating the Biden administration with kid gloves. And unfortunately, that's what we've come to expect out of this federal government that they just have two standards of how they pursue the law.""
On Bidenomics:
""Bidenomics is very simple: you pay more for less. At the end of the day, it represents a rationalization for a declining standard of living for hardworking Americans. And I think you're--what you pointed out with home prices is exactly right. Given where interest rates are now, getting a traditional three bedroom, two bath house for a family is unattainable for a lot of people now. The amount you're paying in mortgage payments has gone up dramatically, just since Biden has become president. You also have automobiles that are increasingly becoming unattainable. And Biden wants to put all these green mandates and force you into an electric vehicle, which is going to make it even more difficult. And of course, everybody's grocery bill has gone up dramatically. So when they say inflation peaked at say 9%, and now it's quote, a lot less at 5%, you know, that only captures some of this. There's a lot more that's gone into this. People have paid way more than 9% year over year. And at the end of the day, Bidenomics, with the inflation, that's an invisible crushing tax on every single American. The wealthy people do fine on it because they have financial assets. It's really those hard-working people that get swamped. I don't know why anybody would want to sign up for four more years of that.""

Tim ScottAmerica's NewsroomJuly 6, 2023
Bill Hemmer: I don't know how it works out, but South Carolina's first in the barrel. And we'll see whether or not that sticks. He's gonna talk about Bidenomics today. He's gonna talk about the infrastructure deal. He's gonna talk about the Inflation Reduction Act, whatever that is. How's that working out for the people in the Palmetto State?
Tim Scott: Well, I hope he is gonna start his apology tour here in South Carolina because what the president wants the American people to do is to believe what he says and not what we see with our own eyes. What we see with our own eyes, Bill, is a loss of $10,000 of spending power. Since President Biden has taken office, we've seen a 40% increase in gas prices, 20% increase in food. And unfortunately, Bill, $2,000 more is what it costs for electricity coming to your home.
But worse of all, every single month since he's been in office, except for one, inflation is outpacing increases in wages. We've done better. We can do better. And when I'm president of the United States, we're gonna continue what we did before: cutting taxes, putting more dollars in the pockets of the average family, and increasing an incentive-based economy like my opportunity zones, where within those zones, wages went up 8% while inflation was only 2%. We can do better by trusting the American people with their own money.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Governor Ron DeSantis joined Tomi Lahren on Outkick tonight. The highlights are below.
Watch the full interview HERE.
HIGHLIGHTS
On cocaine being found at the White House:
""I have long believed, I think a lot of us have believed, that the Biden administration has been blowing it on a lot of fronts. But I guess it's a little bit more literal than even I had thought. I could tell you in Florida, my wife and I, we have a six, five, and a three-year-old running around the Governor's Mansion. So that's not something that we see. We do have to occasionally get slime out of the carpet and get marker off the wallpaper. But that's the extent of our adventures at the Governor's Mansion.""
On the need to reverse Bidenomics:
""Bidenomics means you pay more for everything in life. If you look at the difference between when he took office and now, how much does it cost to get a mortgage? Interest rates are significantly higher. How much is your grocery bill? How much does it cost to buy a new car? So all the staples of life are increasingly becoming unaffordable for average Americans, and it is a direct result of bad federal policy. Borrowing and printing trillions of dollars- the Fed printing trillions of dollars over the last few years sparked significant inflation. Of course, Biden throws gasoline on the fire, not only with his spending policies, but also a how he's using the bureaucracy. He's kneecapping American domestic energy industry, he's trying to do things like DEI and ESG in the economy, which is not good for opportunity or not good for growth. And he's trying to force everybody into an electric vehicle. So all that means is it's going to increasingly be more difficult for the average family to make ends meet. And so as President, we're going to rip up all of Biden's economic policies, and we're going to restore the economy to something where people can actually succeed again.""
On protecting parents' rights and the innocence of children:
""Well I'll tell you, I think this is going to be a blockbuster issue. I think it's somewhat of a sleeper issue because the media doesn't really understand the potency. But when you start talking about people like Biden and his ilk, what they're saying is, 'these are all of our kids,' that it is not just your kids, it's quote 'ours.' And I'm just thinking to myself, wait a minute, my wife and I have a six, five, and three-year-old; they are your kids too? No, no, they are our kids. We are the parents, we have the fundamental right to direct their education and upbringing. And here is the thing, that is a view of the primacy of parents, that is not just a Republican view, it is not just an Independent view. There are a lot of Democrat parents who agree with us on this. So I think the Left's playing with fire when they think that they can use schools and other institutions to supersede the rights of parents... So we have to reestablish the rights of parents, not just in Florida, which we've done, but all across the country. And I think you have a Left-wing movement in this country that is fundamentally hostile to the rights of parents. The media will say somehow by us standing up for parents, we're just trying to engage in a 'culture war.' Let me tell you, the Left is the one that's waging the culture war; we are simply standing up and fighting back against that and standing up for the freedom of our families to raise their kids the way they see fit.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — This morning, Governor Ron DeSantis joined guest host and South Carolina State Senator Josh Kimbrell for the Greenville, SC-based radio show The Morning Answer. Find highlights below:
Listen to the full interview HERE.
On the significance of Independence Day:
""You know, we -- our Founding Fathers risked their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to establish a nation conceived in freedom. And if they had not been successful, they all would have been beheaded and lost their lives. And they stood up and it changed the course of human history. So, we need to appreciate the uniqueness of America and we need to give thanks for their sacrifice.""
On his plans to break the swamp:
""I'm the only public official in America that has actually removed George-Soros funded prosecutor, which we did in Tampa. When I became Governor, I removed the Sheriff of Broward County who bungled the Parkland School shooting massacre. We've removed local election officials who were bungling elections. We've taken swift, decisive action to be able to ensure that we have a constitutionally accountable government. And I think if you look nationally, we were told in 2016, by then-candidate Trump, he was going to Drain the Swamp. The Swamp got way worse under his administration, and he didn't even fire Dr. Anthony Fauci. And in fact, gave Fauci an award on his last day in office, January 19, 2021. And so, I would have fired Fauci in a New York minute.
When I'm President, we will have a new director of the FBI. It's interesting, Donald Trump says, 'Christopher Wray, the jury's still out on him,' as if you would consider keeping him. That would not be the case with me, you know, we would have top-to-bottom housecleaning. But we'll also have a plan, and you got to be disciplined, you got to be focused, you can't get distracted when it comes to dealing with these people. But we're going to have a plan to systematically remove power out of Washington, D.C., and there'll be a number of different things that are involved with that. But the reality is, we have accumulation of power in the bureaucracy. It has become a fourth branch of government, which our Founding Fathers never intended, and did not put in the Constitution. This bureaucracy acts with impunity against us, it imposes its will on us, when I come to town, it'll be time for We the People to impose our will on it.""
On his plan to stop the invasion and secure the border:
""On day one, we're declaring this a national emergency. That's going to allow me to mobilize all available resources, including the military to get down to the border and stop the invasion. We've got to stop the invasion. Yes, we will construct a border wall. I think it's important. Some people say, 'Oh, just use technology.' No, the border is so big. You have to have barriers there otherwise it's just not going to work. We're also going to fight the Mexican drug cartels. I think if you look at what's happened, these cartels basically operate the border. They move product in with impunity. We have 10s of 1000s of people dying because of fentanyl overdose. It's interesting, Josh, because I've been down to different parts of the border over the last several years. About a month ago, I was in Arizona, and there was a barrier there. Big steel beams, some of it was under Obama, some of us under Trump, but the cartels will actually cut through the big steel beams, and they'll run product in. Yet, we just let that happen. What I said is, you know, we're going to have rules of engagement, so that if the cartels are breaking through our border wall to try to run drugs in, that's going to be the last thing they ever do, because those people are going to end up stone cold dead. We're going to use force to defend our country. We're also going to be willing to be forward leaning against the cartels in Mexico, as well as conduct maritime operations to interdict all these precursor chemicals that are coming in from China.""
On how he has defeated the woke in Florida and would do so as president:
""Woke ideology impacts the economy, the military, criminal law, everything. Our freedom is under assault as woke infects more institutions. I've defeated the woke in Florida. As President, together we will defeat the woke all across this country.""

65% of U.S. Adults Say They Are Concerned That AI Could Lead To Job Losses

Artificial Intelligence and robotics are rapidly evolving industries and technologies, raising the question: ""Will robots take my job?"" I've explored this question for almost a decade. I held the first congressional hearing on artificial intelligence (AI) in 2015, I wrote the U.S. national strategy for AI that was signed into law in 2020, and since being out of government I've both advised and served on the boards of companies on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. I recently wrote a primer on the subject called An Artificial Intelligence Definition for Dummies.
Here is what I have learned from these collective experiences. We can have an economy where AI and automation don't lead to significant unemployment, but instead get a greater number of people engaged in more meaningful, fulfilling work that leads to an improved quality of life for everyone. However, to achieve this vision where AI doesn't replace human workers around the world, we must act now. 
Will A Robot Take My job? – The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Job Market and Economy
Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the way we work, transforming industries and changing the face of businesses around the world. In May 2023, market research analysts from Morning Consult assessed through public opinion polling on artificial intelligence how these trends were being viewed by human workers across several industries.

Nearly two-thirds (65%) of U.S. adults fear AI may cause job losses, according to the over 13,000+ respondents. Tech and finance workers expressed the most concern. However, opinions on AI creating new jobs for human employees were split, with 37% agreeing and 39% disagreeing.

Shares Of Employed U.S. Adults in Each Industry Who Said They Are Concerned That AI Will Result In Job Loss For Their Industry:
AI can be a tool that boosts the productivity and efficiency of human workers by eliminating routine tasks and allowing employees to focus on more value-added tasks. It's only a matter of time before AI is ubiquitous through our society like the Internet or smart phones.
Machines are becoming more intelligent and capable of performing complex tasks that we always thought could only be done by the human brain. This trend is causing many to ask whether automation, AI, or a combination of both will decrease the amount of jobs requiring a human being or even replace human workers altogether in the near future.
The ultimate question we should be asking ourselves, our leaders, and those who are making this technology is: Can we ensure AI creates new jobs and opportunities, while preventing widespread job losses and economic disruption? Put another way, can we ensure we take advantage of technology before it takes advantage of us?
The Relationship Between Artificial Intelligence and Automation

While both automation and artificial intelligence are capable of reducing human intervention in processes, they differ fundamentally. Automation refers to a system or process that operates based on predefined rules, without the need for human involvement. From industrial robots on assembly lines to computer scripts performing repetitive tasks, automation has been a cornerstone of modern industry.
In contrast, AI seeks to replicate human intelligence and decision-making, performing tasks that typically require human cognition, such as pattern recognition, learning from experience, or natural language understanding. Unlike traditional automation, which follows rigid instructions, AI systems have the capacity to learn and adapt over time through machine learning and have even recently displayed the ability to match human creativity.
Historically, human workers have expressed concerns about both automation and artificial intelligence as they have the potential to automate tasks, improve efficiencies, and consequently reduce the need for human intervention in many job roles.
The Historical Impact of Automation on Human Workers

Photo: A drawing of a spinning jenny. It was invented in 1764 by James Hargreaves, an English cotton weaver. Spinners took raw materials (such as wool, flax, and cotton) and turned them into thread. The original spinning jenny did the work of 8 people. – Encyclopedia Britannica
Automation is not a new concept. It has been around for centuries. One of the first uses of automation in the workforce can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th Century. The invention of machines like the spinning jenny and the power loom (a machine for weaving cloth) automated the process of weaving and spinning, which were previously done manually. This marked the beginning of the shift from manual labor to mechanized work in industries such as textiles.
Spinners became angry about the competition and automation risk to their livelihood, because the invention of the spinning jenny enabled a machine to do the work of eight people. In 1768, a group of spinners broke into Hargreaves' house and destroyed his machines to prevent them from taking away their work. However, increased production per person eventually led to the drop in prices paid for thread.
If we consider automation in a broader sense, even earlier examples exist. For instance, water wheels and windmills, used for grinding grain or pumping water, were early forms of automation that replaced human or animal labor, and these technologies date back to ancient times.
In the context of modern automation, the first industrial robot, Unimate, was installed on a General Motors assembly line in New Jersey in 1959 and began to be mass produced in 1961. It performed tasks that were dangerous for humans, such as handling hot die-cast parts and welding. 
The use of automation has allowed for greater efficiency, productivity, and cost savings in many industries. For example, factories have been able to automate their production processes, allowing for faster and more consistent production. However, with the benefits of automation come drawbacks. The increasing use of automation has led to some jobs and even careers becoming obsolete.
Introducing AI In the Workplace

Just like automation, AI is not a new concept. The term ""Artificial Intelligence"" was first coined by legendary American computer scientist and cognitive scientist John McCarthy in 1956, and the first working rudimentary AI programs were developed in the 1950s and 1960s.
AI's integration into the workplace has picked up pace in recent years with developments in the field like reinforcement learning. Having algorithms that can learn from its experiences and make predictions based on patterns it observes, has made AI a valuable asset for many industries.
Pros of AI in the Workplace – Efficiency, Accuracy, and Productivity

Photo: Aurora's autonomous vehicles, transporting FedEx shipments between Fort Worth and El Paso, signify a new era in freight delivery, with daily and weekly trips increasing in frequency.
One of the biggest advantages of AI in the workplace is its ability to increase efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. AI can perform tasks faster and with greater accuracy than humans, reducing the risk of errors and improving overall performance. This allows businesses to focus on more complex tasks and make better use of their time and resources. AI helping businesses identify patterns and trends in data, enables those businesses to make more informed decisions.
As of early 2023, there are roughly 10 million unfilled jobs in the United States alone. Seven million of those job openings are for essential roles in warehouses, transportation, and retail. Attrition rates are high in many of these roles. However, there are only about 6 million people available to fill these open positions. Many warehouse suppliers predict they will run out of people to hire by 2024. This labor shortage scenario could be significantly alleviated by harnessing the potential of AI to automate tasks and improve efficiency.
Cons of AI in the Workplace – Job Displacement, Lack of Human Interaction, and Potential Bias

Photo: An American Express Travel Services Office in London, England. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the number of full-time travel agency employees in the U.S. had fallen from a peak of 124,000 in 2000 to 64,000 twelve years later.
While some jobs will be completely automated, others will be transformed, requiring workers to learn new skills and adapt to new roles. This could lead to a skills gap, where there is a shortage of workers with the necessary skills to perform these new roles.
Another concern is the lack of human interaction that comes with the use of AI. While AI can perform many tasks faster and more accurately than humans, it lacks the emotional intelligence and empathy that is necessary for many jobs. This can lead to a loss of personal touch in customer service and other areas of business.
There is also the potential for bias in AI systems, which can lead to discrimination. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on, and if that data is biased, the system will be biased as well. This can lead to unfair treatment of individuals or groups and can perpetuate existing inequalities.
Examples of Successful AI Integration in the Workplace

Photo: The 1997 rematch between chess Garry Kasparov and IBM's computer Deep Blue. It was the first time a current world champion had lost a match to a computer under tournament conditions. 
Despite the concerns about AI in the workplace, there are many examples of successful integration. For example, AI is being used in the healthcare industry to analyze medical images and assist with diagnosis. In the financial industry, AI is being used to detect fraud and predict market trends. AI is also being used in manufacturing to automate production lines and improve quality control.
There have been many impactful applications of AI that the public has been using for years. Some examples are:

IBM's Deep Blue: In 1997, IBM's chess-playing computer, Deep Blue, defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. This was a landmark moment, demonstrating that AI could outperform humans at complex strategy games.
Google's Search Algorithms: Google uses AI and machine learning to improve its search results, providing more accurate and personalized results for users. AI has helped Google's search engine understand the intent behind users' search queries and provide more relevant results.
Self-Driving Cars: Companies like Waymo and Tesla have been developing self-driving cars using AI. These vehicles use a combination of machine learning, computer vision, and sensor data to navigate roads and traffic.
Speech Recognition and Personal Assistants: AI is behind the voice recognition capabilities of personal assistant technologies like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google Assistant. These systems use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to human speech.
Recommendation Systems: AI is used in the recommendation algorithms of platforms like Netflix and Spotify to personalize content for users based on their past behaviors and preferences.

Each of these use cases has had a significant impact on the field of AI and demonstrated the technology's potential for practical, real-world applications. Nevertheless, it was the introduction of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, that brought generative AI to the forefront of our consciousness and reignited the concerns about job displacement previously associated with automation. 
Historically automation sparked concerns primarily from blue-collar workers due to the mechanization of manual tasks. Now AI is generating similar worries from white-collar workers, since its capabilities encroach upon the intellectual and administrative tasks traditionally safe from technological displacement. 
What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence, but it takes things a step further. Instead of just learning to understand and respond to inputs – like a chatbot that answers customer service inquiries – generative AI can create new, original content. This can range from writing an article, composing music, creating a design, to even generating a realistic image from a simple text description.
With the help of vast amounts of data and complex algorithms, generative AI is not just mimicking or repeating patterns it's learned, but it's generating entirely new ideas.
A Blueprint for the Age of Artificial Intelligence

The use of AI in the workplace is only going to increase in the coming years, and it is important for businesses and workers to prepare for the changes that are coming to our immediate future. We need to take the following strategic actions to ensure that the future of AI and the workforce is not a dystopian one.
Cultivate a Workforce Ready for AI-Driven Economic Growth and Employment Opportunities
The onset of AI is ushering in a new industrial revolution, offering the potential to shape new industries and generate significant economic benefits. The transition, however, presents challenges for workers as AI automates some jobs but also creates new high-tech roles. This shift demands strategic workforce development:

Skill Development: Cultivate workforce skills that complement AI, such as creativity, problem-solving, and domain expertise, along with hard skills like computer programming, data science, statistics, and machine learning.
Education Investment: Boost investment in STEM education and incorporate computer science into the standard curriculum in middle school to prepare children for future jobs.
Vocational Training: Increase funding for vocational and technical training programs that prepare workers for careers in AI and related fields.

Secure National Interests through AI

AI plays a critical role in national security, and as a country we need to stay on the cutting edge of this technology. For every positive use there is for AI there is a nefarious one. We need to be able to defend against bad use cases. Key steps include:

AI for Defense: Equip our military and intelligence communities with the resources they need to leverage AI.
Invest in Cybersecurity: The future of cybersecurity will be good AI versus bad AI. We need to prioritize investment in AI-based cybersecurity solutions to address growing security concerns.

Craft Legislation to Enforce Ethical Practices and Regulatory Frameworks

AI's future requires a robust ethical framework and effective regulation. With privacy, bias, and misuse all potential and ongoing issues, it's vital to ensure AI is built upon the following ideals:

Transparency: This means understanding how an AI system makes decisions. It's key to building trust and preventing misuse.
Accountability: This is about identifying who's responsible when AI decisions lead to negative outcomes. It ensures parties involved in creating AI can be held liable for its behavior.
Non-discrimination: This principle ensures AI systems don't amplify existing biases. It involves careful data curation and rigorous testing to identify and mitigate biases.

To make these principles the ethical backbone of AI deployment and use, we need to accomplish these essential measures:

Law Abiding: Confirm that all AI tools abide by the law, with no special exemptions.
Data Ownership: Codify into law that an individual owns and can control all the data that makes up their digital footprint.
Licensing Authority: Just like a company needs a license to build a nuclear power plant, powerful AI models over a certain size should need to obtain a license from a regulatory authority. 
IP Clarity: Implement legislation clarifying the importance of intellectual property protection and the necessity for creators to be appropriately compensated when their creations are utilized in AI-generated content. Content owners should receive significant benefit and be duly rewarded for the use of their intellectual property.  

To develop, craft and pass legislation to achieve these objectives we are going to need to elect tech-literate officials who understand these technologies that are going to shape our future.
Assert Global Leadership through Public-Private Partnerships

America's leadership in AI research, development, and ethics is vital in the global landscape. Establishing this foothold requires strategic public-private partnerships:

Collaborative Innovation: Partner with tech companies, universities, and research institutions to drive AI innovation and address domestic and global challenges.

We Can Balance Human and AI Capabilities in the Workplace
As we navigate the AI era, it's clear that AI's role in our workplaces will be crucial. Work will be a blend of human creativity and AI efficiency.
AI's integration will redefine roles and create new ones. This will require adaptability and the need to evolve. We must focus on reskilling our workforce for future jobs, investing in education and training programs that equip people with skills to make AI work alongside us not the other way around.
A strong ethical framework must guide AI development and deployment. Transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination should be our guiding principles. We need regulations ensuring responsible and ethical AI use.
The future of work is not humans vs. AI, but humans with AI. It's about using AI as a tool that augments human capabilities, not one that replaces them. It's about striking the right balance between human creativity and AI efficiency to create a workplace that is innovative, productive, and above all else, human.
In the end, AI is just a tool, and like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. Let's use it to build, not destroy; to create, not replace; to advance, not regress. Humanity and technology must coexist so we can create a world that is better than today.

This morning, Governor DeSantis attended the Moms for Liberty Summit in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he spoke about how he has protected parental rights and defended the innocence of children in Florida and would do so for the nation as President.
HIGHLIGHTS:
** On how being a parent to three young children shapes his approach to protecting kids: **
*""We've done so much on these issues in Florida and I will do all this as the next president. I see the issue not just through the lens of a governor, or a presidential candidate. I see these issues through the lens of a dad of a 6, a 5, and a 3-year-old. My wife and I really believe that parents in this country should be able to send their kids to school, should be able to let them watch cartoons, or just be kids without having some agenda shoved down their throats."" *
On Florida legislation that stopped the sexualization of children in schools:
""We've also leaned in on, and it's sad that we even have to discuss this, but the idea that you would instruct a second-grade student that they that their gender is a choice or that they were born in the wrong body, is wrong. And in Florida, we took a stand against that. We said we're not going to have the sexualization of our children in our schools. And I'll tell you parents across Florida, regardless of party, they appreciated that. They want their kids focused on math, and reading, and key subjects. They don't want an agenda imposed, particularly things that are inappropriate for school children, like gender ideology.""
On Florida legislation that gives parents the right to direct their children's education:
""We have enacted a Parent's Bill of Rights in the state of Florida because we understand that the purpose of our school systems are to support the communities, to support students, and parents; it is not to supersede the rights of parents. Parents, parents have a fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children and that means being involved in what is being taught in their school. It also means that every parent in this country should be able to have the wherewithal to send their kid to the school of their choice. We've made that a reality in Florida.""
DeSantis also participated in a fireside chat with Moms for Liberty co-founder, Tiffany Justice.
**On what it's like being a father while running for President: **
""It's funny, because at same time, we're out there doing this [campaigning], but we're parents and we're dealing with kids just like anyone... and we did it with Governor too. I used to take the kids to press conferences. I mean, I would literally be at the press conference on COVID, and I'd have my son Mason or my daughter Madison just hanging out by the podium, just watching and it's because my wife and I, we just want to spend as much time with them as possible. And so we can bring the family when we're going. It's great. I think it is good experiences for them. But a lot of it for us is just --I always try to be home anytime I'm doing stuff in Florida. I always just try to be home in time for dinner, right after dinner, be able to put them to bed and then be there the next morning. And so we're juggling all that. My wife is a superstar, some of you know her and she does a great job. ""
**On how he will protect the fundamental rights of parents: **
""We will pull the levers that we have available to us to be able to defend the rights of parents. Part of being an executive is you're not just the head of a company. You're the head of one branch of government, but there's checks and balances. There's different constitutional authorities. So you need to know what levers are available to you, what type of leverage you have to be able to bring these things into fruition. Some will be through executive. There's things you can do through federal agencies, like for example, to protect women's sports, and not have gender ideology in the bat--there's definitely things you can do on those. There's things that Congress, we're going to need to do to be able to do that. So we have a good understanding going in on day one what all those authorities are, and we'll pull the levers that we need to.""
On how Florida has stopped the indoctrination of children in classrooms:
""I think educating the public on what's going on is important. We have not done that enough. We've done it some in Florida. Buckle your seat belts, we're going to be doing that across this country. So just be prepared, be ready for that... we just want education, right? If you're trying to impose an agenda, we are going to reject the book. So give it to us straight and what happens is because we have such a big population, a lot of these companies have made changes that then make the book a normal schoolbook, but this is going in all directions. And if you don't have kind of a united front against it, it is absolutely going to end up winning the day. Very, very insidious, but I think part of it is conservatives have allowed the left--they just said 'Oh, education is for the left and we don't really care about that.' No, no, no. I'm fighting on all this ground to do what's right, and we have to do that.""

CHARLESTON, SC –  This morning, Tim Scott joined FOX & Friends to applaud the Supreme Court's recent ruling on affirmative action and discuss American progress.
Watch the full interview here.
Tim ScottFOX & FriendsJune 30, 2023
Tim Scott: Progress in America is palpable. That is good news: that we have made reasonable progress in reasonable time. That means that today most of us judge each other by the content of our character, not the color of our skin. And in order to form a more perfect union, what do we have to do? We have to make sure that today is better than yesterday. That this year is better than last year, this decade better than last decade. That is a story of America. And that is why the last time I saw a poll, two out of three African Americans said, ""using race as a primary factor?"" Not necessary. 58% of Asians or more. 65% of Hispanics. All come to the same decision. The state of California struck down racial preferences. So what does that say about America? From the hearts of Americans, we believe in each other. That's good news. And why the radical left is screaming at the top of their lungs? Power. Control. Not progress.
...
Steve Doocy: As we head into the 4th of July holiday weekend, there's a new poll out by Gallup and it talks a little bit about how people feel less patriotic than they did a couple of years ago right now. And then there's this one. America's best days are behind us. A plurality of people say that we're on the wrong track.
Tim Scott: Well, we are on the wrong track. It's time for us to fire Joe Biden, fire Merrick Garland, fire Christopher Wray, and let's restore confidence in the halls of justice. But more importantly, let's stop telling Americans the lie that the Left tells them that we live in a racist, declining country. That this is not the land of opportunity, it's the land of oppression. Let's stop selling the drug of victimhood and the narcotic of despair. Let's start engaging the American people around the painful, truthful history of America. That we rise to the occasion. Good news is coming!

""We have enacted a Parent's Bill of Rights in the state of Florida because we understand that the purpose of our school systems are to support the communities, to support students, and parents; it is not to supersede the rights of parents. Parents, parents have a fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children and that means being involved in what is being taught in their school. It also means that every parent in this country should be able to have the wherewithal to send their kid to the school of their choice. We've made that a reality in Florida.""
DeSantis also participated in a fireside chat with Moms for Liberty co-founder, Tiffany Justice.
**On what it's like being a father while running for President: **
""It's funny, because at same time, we're out there doing this [campaigning], but we're parents and we're dealing with kids just like anyone... and we did it with Governor too. I used to take the kids to press conferences. I mean, I would literally be at the press conference on COVID, and I'd have my son Mason or my daughter Madison just hanging out by the podium, just watching and it's because my wife and I, we just want to spend as much time with them as possible. And so we can bring the family when we're going. It's great. I think it is good experiences for them. But a lot of it for us is just --I always try to be home anytime I'm doing stuff in Florida. I always just try to be home in time for dinner, right after dinner, be able to put them to bed and then be there the next morning. And so we're juggling all that. My wife is a superstar, some of you know her and she does a great job. ""
**On how he will protect the fundamental rights of parents: **
""We will pull the levers that we have available to us to be able to defend the rights of parents. Part of being an executive is you're not just the head of a company. You're the head of one branch of government, but there's checks and balances. There's different constitutional authorities. So you need to know what levers are available to you, what type of leverage you have to be able to bring these things into fruition. Some will be through executive. There's things you can do through federal agencies, like for example, to protect women's sports, and not have gender ideology in the bat--there's definitely things you can do on those. There's things that Congress, we're going to need to do to be able to do that. So we have a good understanding going in on day one what all those authorities are, and we'll pull the levers that we need to.""
On how Florida has stopped the indoctrination of children in classrooms:
""I think educating the public on what's going on is important. We have not done that enough. We've done it some in Florida. Buckle your seat belts, we're going to be doing that across this country. So just be prepared, be ready for that... we just want education, right? If you're trying to impose an agenda, we are going to reject the book. So give it to us straight and what happens is because we have such a big population, a lot of these companies have made changes that then make the book a normal schoolbook, but this is going in all directions. And if you don't have kind of a united front against it, it is absolutely going to end up winning the day. Very, very insidious, but I think part of it is conservatives have allowed the left--they just said 'Oh, education is for the left and we don't really care about that.' No, no, no. I'm fighting on all this ground to do what's right, and we have to do that.""

"DeSantis Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Ron DeSantis on Daily Wire: ""How To Fix California: DeSantis on the Ground in San Francisco""",2023-06-29T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-icymi-ron-desantis-daily-wire-how-fix-california-desantis,"
Democrats want to take the same leftist policies that have destroyed California and enact them nationwide. Ron DeSantis is running for president to stop them.
In an exclusive interview with Daily Wire, Ron DeSantis walked through the streets of San Francisco and discussed with Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief John Bickley the disastrous consequence of leftist policies: Uncontrollable homelessness, widespread drug use, and lawlessness. As president, Ron DeSantis is committed to stopping radical leftist policies from gaining traction in cities and communities nationwide.
While walking through the streets, San Francisco police officers and firefighters recognized Governor DeSantis and offered their appreciation for his pro-law enforcement policies and support.
Watch the full Daily Wire video HERE.
GOVERNOR DESANTIS: ""You've really seen a city that used to be one of the best in the country, you've just seen it become hollowed out. And it's a direct result of leftist policy and leftist ideology. I never saw a California license plate growing up in Florida, then I become governor. We have Californians flooding leaving San Francisco to go to Miami and other places. It was intolerable to live in this area because they don't care about crime, they don't care about homelessness. No one wants to live under those circumstances.
""You know, there's probably a few levers you can pull but basically to target of the Soros-funded prosecutors who get elected like they had here in San Francisco, and they get elected on a platform not to enforce laws they don't like. I've talked to people that have moved to Florida from here and other parts of the country and they say, you know, someone mugged me, or they robbed my car, they even broke into my home, no prosecution. I mean, can you imagine that? Of course, you're going to get more crime as a result. Whatever they do, we try to do the opposite on a lot of this stuff. I mean, I think they are very tolerant about illegal drug use, particularly public, we will not countenance that. And then their approach to criminal justice has been a total disaster.

Governor DeSantis stopped by Grimaldi's Coal Brick-Oven Pizzeria this afternoon to visit with the owners and enjoy a slice with Jesse Watters. In an interview that aired on Jesse Watters Primetime on Fox News Channel tonight, Governor Ron DeSantis said, *""They [the Left] just want to control. You have an itch on the left, they want to control behavior."" *
Following the interview, the DeSantis campaign amplified the governor's defense of coal-fired ovens by launching pizza-themed tee shirts that read*, ""Biden...one term, everyone knows the rules.""*
**On why the Left is going after coal-fired ovens: **
""They just want to control. You have an itch on the left, they want to control behavior. We saw the same thing with Covid. A lot of that was not about your health, it was about that they wanted to control your behavior. They just do not want people to be happy and be able to make their own decisions. They were going after gas stoves in Florida, we made them tax free. We may have to do some incentives for the coal fired pizza.""
On Bidenomics:
""Bidenomics is: you pay more for the necessities of life. And he has this grand global warming vision with all the Green New Deal. You will pay more for everyday energy, transportation and groceries. We have seen it happen in other parts of the world. That is what he wants in store for the average American.""
**On his plan to stop the invasion and secure the border: **
""One of the things I saw, the places where there were barriers, the cartels actually cut through the steel beams, and they'll smuggle in backpacks with a lot of drugs. So what I said is, wait a minute, we defend the territory of our own country, we'll have military and everyone down there. If you are in the cartels cutting through our fence to bring drugs in, that's going to be the last thing you do because we're going to leave you stone cold dead. We are having adequate rules of engagement.""

 Also Note:

In an interview with Martha MacCallum on Wednesday, Governor DeSantis said: ""He [Joe Biden] is wrong on energy. His vision to not have domestic energy production is going to lead to the average family paying more for energy. It's going to make them poorer. If you think about it, he's talking about global warming, all this stuff, China builds a new coal-fired plant like every week. What is the administration doing and their allies in state and local governments? They're trying to stop coal-fired pizza shops from being able to operate in New York City. I think they have all of this backwards, and I think at the end of the day, the average working person knows, it's harder to make ends meet under Joe Biden as president.""

Tim ScottFOX News' Faulkner FocusJune 29, 2023
Julie Banderas: Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina Republican Candidate for President joins me now. This is a monumental decision that has reversed a decision that has been in place for 19 years. What is your reaction today?
Tim Scott: Well, Julie, I think this is a good day for America. Honestly. This is the day where we understand that being judged by the content of our character, not the color of our skin, is what our Constitution wants. We are continuing to work on forming this more perfect union. Today is better than yesterday, this year, better than last year, this decade better than last decade. The progress that we're seeing in this nation, it's palpable. That's good news for every single corridor of this nation and one that we should celebrate. I thank God Almighty that America continues to work towards that concept of a more perfect union.
Julie Banderas: How do these universities, such as the University of North Carolina and Harvard, in this case now move on and continue to fulfill their diverse campus as they both want? These prominent schools say that their standards have a larger societal goal, one endorsed for decades by the courts to promote a robust, intellectually diverse campus for future leaders. Um, is it, is it safe to say that they're not gonna want to continue that mission since they had been on that mission for 19 years? How is this court ruling going to prevent them from continuing down that path?
Tim Scott: Well, I think the question is how do you continue to create a culture where education is the goal for every single part of our community? One of the things that Harvard can do to make that even better is to eliminate any legacy programs where they have preferential treatment for legacy kids. So, right, not allow for the professors that their, their kids to come to Harvard as well. They're looking for a way to improve the footprint of Harvard. Let's make sure that all admissions are based on academic scores and not just eliminating affirmative action. But let's look at the legacy programs. Let's look at the fact that the professor's kids get to go there as well. The good news for America, though, is that anyone from anywhere at any time can rise above beyond their circumstances and live out their American dream. Whether that's going to Harvard, if you can't get into my alma mater or Charleston Southern University, maybe that's a better option. I don't know, choose University of South Carolina or Clemson. Our education system is the marvel of the world, thank God, where Americans, and thank God today we continue to see signs of progress in every aspect of American life.
Julie Banderas: Yeah, we certainly are. Today is a monumental day. I wanna move on to a statement on the decision from former President Obama and the former First Lady. It reads, in part, 'My heart breaks for any young person out there who's wondering what their future holds and what kinds of chances will be open to them. Today is a reminder that we've got to do the work, not just to enact policies that reflect our values of equity and fairness, but to truly make those values real in all of our schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods.' Now, what is that saying to African-Americans in this country, coming from a former African-American president and our very first African and only African-American president? It's basically saying to me, would you concur that African-Americans, if you were going to apply to a college, well now you are gonna have a harder time. That is not a positive message to be sending to the American people because that's not the case in this landmark decision.
Tim Scott: Well, the good news is we're gonna have another African American president. His name will be Tim Scott. And this is January 2025. Here's what I would say to America today, that I am excited about who we are as a nation. I'm excited about the progress that we've seen in the rear view mirror, but what excites me the most about America is that when you look at the windshield of our future, it is bright for all of our kids. Unfortunately, the radical left have been co-opted by the teachers unions. And so making sure that we get back to providing quality education in every single zip code in this nation, K-12, means that with quality education K-12, your child can go to the most elite colleges in America. If we fix public education, we will make sure that every generation going forward will have access to opportunities.
Tim Scott: And oh, by the way, I'm not sure that going to an elite university is the path to prosperity. It is actually going as high as your character, your grit and your talent will take you. That means whether you go to Harvard, Charleston Southern, or whether you wanna be a plumber or a welder, you too can experience your version of the American Dream. I'm running for president because I know America can do for anyone what she has done for me. But sending the message that somehow the color of your skin means that you will not be able to achieve your goals from an educational perspective, from an income perspective, or family formation, that is a lie from the pit of hell. We will not be judged solely by the color of our skin. That's what the ruling said today. But that is the story of America. That is a story of American progress, and we can all celebrate that today.

Julie Banderas: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeting that Biden's policies have been an economic disaster. Another congressman writing, inflation reaches 40 year highs. This is Bidenomics folks. We are not in a place where you can really, quite frankly, be bragging about this economy. I mean, Democrats love to talk about how wages are up. Let's talk about inflation. Let's talk about interest rates. Let's talk about the fact that young people can't buy new homes and they can't get mortgages because the interest rates are astronomical. That's not a positive economy to be bragging about.
Tim Scott: What we need to do as American People, fire Joe Biden and hire Tim Scott. Let's talk about Joe Biden's economy, $10,000 is the amount of money the average family has lost since Joe Biden has taken office. Why? Because when inflation hits 16% since he's taken office, that means that the average family today is experiencing a crisis. When your gas price goes up 40%, and your food's up 20%, and your electricity costs $2,200 more this year than it did last year, it is a crisis. The last thing we need to hear is Joe Biden doing anything other than saying to the American people, 'I'm sorry, I have no clue how to run this economy. I resign.' He's not gonna say that. So the American people are gonna have to kick him out.

Tim Scott: The closest thing to magic in America is a good education. In the bluest county in Maryland, parents are standing up and saying, I want a choice for my kids' education. But the school district says, stay home. We'll tell you what to think about what your kids are gonna be educated. Don't show up at a school board meeting. You're not invited to know your kid's curriculum.
With my administration, we are going to have people who respect parents. The GOP, the Great Opportunity Party, we are the party of parents because we know that parents getting a choice gives kids the best chance to succeed in the greatest nation on God's green earth. They have to be involved – invested in their kids' education. And now all across America, we're hearing blue city, after blue city, after blue district, bow the knee to the teacher's unions until their parents stay home, do not have a voice!
Thank God the coalition is growing of like-minded, value centric parents, who say, I am going to decide what my child learns in the area of education, around sex education, and around education. They don't want CRTs, they want ABCs. They don't want their kids indoctrinated, Lawrence. They want their kids educated. They want to be involved. That's a good thing in America. Let's get everybody involved. Go to votetimscott.com, join the American Revolution, and let's restore opportunity and choice to parents and every single zip code in America. We can do it together.

The interview follows the release of a memo by the DeSantis campaign today setting the record straight on Biden's failing economy.
Watch the clip here.
GOVERNOR DESANTIS: ""I can tell you what Bidenomics is, Martha. It is everybody pays more for basic staples of life. People are paying way more for groceries, they're paying way more for other necessities like utilities... the cost of buying a new home has gone up dramatically because all the materials have gone up.
In Florida, we're responsible for a lot of these jobs because we've defied his [Biden's] policies. We had our state open, we have low taxes, we have a very strong regulatory climate favorable for businesses. So, you have seen us grow, you've seen other red states grow. Most of those jobs he's talking about are jobs that came back after the COVID lockdowns. They weren't necessarily over and above what a normal economy would do.

While speaking to voters in Hollis, New Hampshire this morning, Governor Ron DeSantis continued to highlight his detailed plan to stop the invasion and secure the border once and for all.
""First thing that comes to my mind is, this is humiliating as a country, to not even be able to control your own territory, your own border, to cede the border to Mexican drug cartels, and to allow tens of thousands of Americans to be poisoned with impunity. That is not the America I know. And we are going to make sure we change that... And the main theme through our border approach is no excuses. We have been hearing about this for how many decades, certainly years, it has been such an issue and a lot of politicians chirp. They make grandiose promises, and then fail to deliver the actual results. And so the time for excuses is over. Now is the time to deliver results and finally get the job done. And we have the plan to do it. But I think more importantly than that, you can look at my record as governor, every time I told someone I do something I did it.""
The campaign also released a video this afternoon recapping the governor's trip to Texas on Sunday and Monday. 
Watch the video HERE. 
And the Washington Examiner published a story this morning highlighting how Texas residents were ""hooked"" when they heard about DeSantis' proposal yesterday. Here are some highlights from the story:
Residents in a border town grappling with sustained illegal immigration and community releases eagerly welcomed 2024 Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis for a visit on Monday.
""Governor DeSantis promised that action will be taken when he wins the presidential election,"" said Alison Anderson, a resident of the nearby border town Del Rio. ""And for me, seeing action being taken against the cartels, the smugglers, the trafficking, the gotaways, and the relentless lawlessness that is happening along our southern border and throughout border communities is something I can certainly stand behind and support.""
Residents in Eagle Pass, a town of roughly 30,000, believed DeSantis's stop was a genuine attempt to hear their concerns and put forth plans to fix them.
Tony Castaneda, a resident of the nearby town Quemado and the former Eagle Pass chief of police, turned out Monday morning because he believed DeSantis meant what he said in his calls for action.
""I really think that the man is very sincere in his message,"" Castaneda said.
The crowd erupted in applause when DeSantis mentioned transporting immigrants to Martha's Vineyard.
Anderson, a mother of three young children, said it was DeSantis's strategy to impose ""consequences"" for illegal immigration that appealed to her the most.
""I am a big believer in if you break the law, you break the law --- there's no reward for being a criminal, in my opinion,"" Anderson said. ""I believe that enforcing our laws is one of the most important things that we need to be doing, especially with immigration law.""
""He was the first one to come and support our governor with the security of our border,"" Castaneda said. ""We need to really focus in on different issues affecting our country, but in this area, immigration is a big subject of concern, especially to people like me that have property on the border on the river, and I've never had this type of invaders come through our property.""

"Remarks on Foreign Policy at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC",2023-06-27T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/remarks-foreign-policy-the-american-enterprise-institute-washington-dc,"
Thank you…
Four years ago last month, shortly after I left the United Nations, I gave a policy speech about China.
I was in Seoul, South Korea.
In part, the speech was about what I'd seen at the UN. In part, it was a broader look at the West's approach to China over the past several decades.
I warned about China's growing military power, its growing repression at home and aggression abroad, and its growing challenge to American interests and America itself. I specifically called out its military-civil fusion program, where the Chinese Communist Party exploits American companies to strengthen its military. I urged our leaders to, quote, ""think about China critically, creatively, and courageously.""
That was four years ago. Much has happened with China since then. None of it good.
China's police state is more comprehensive. It has destroyed freedom in Hong Kong. It has deepened its genocide of the Uyghurs. It is threatening Taiwan daily. Its ""no limits"" alliance with Russia has cemented. And of course, there was Covid. Despite its on-going attempts at cover-up, the Chinese Communist Party bears responsibility for the worst worldwide pandemic in a century – with up to twenty million deaths.
Through it all, the Chinese military has become even stronger. It is testing us like never before.
Last month, a Chinese fighter jet came within 400 feet of an American aircraft flying in international air space above the South China Sea.
Earlier this month, a Chinese naval ship came within 150 yards of an American destroyer in the Taiwan Strait.
We all remember the Chinese spy balloon that flew over our homeland just four months ago. It wasn't taking pictures of our prairies and beaches – it was flying over American nuclear missile sites.
And this month it was revealed that China has developed a spy base in our own backyard on the fellow Communist island of Cuba.
These provocations are not coincidences or accidents. They are the purposeful actions of a Communist dictatorship that is determined to expand its power and defeat America militarily and economically.
America is China's number one target.
The question is, what are we going to do about it?
This is a central question of presidential leadership – both for the current president, and the next one.
Communist China is the greatest threat to American security and prosperity, by far.
It has the stated goal of diminishing American influence in the world and replacing it with its own.
To meet this threat, there must be a series of fundamental shifts in our policies.
Before I describe those changes, let's first look at what we should shift away from.
China became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001. This proved to be a fateful decision.
America brought China into the WTO. Democrats and Republicans supported it. At the time, and for more than a decade after, there was a bipartisan consensus that this was all reward and no risk. Our leaders told us it would bring China into the modern economy and open its huge market to the world. They said it would make China more free, open, and democratic. That China would become more like us.
I understand why this dream was appealing. We saw it happen with Japan after World War II, and then again with one Asian country after another. From South Korea to Singapore, they moved into the company of free and open nations.
But not China.
This American assumption proved disastrously false. Our thinking neglected the role of communist ideology. The Chinese Communist Party didn't want to be like us. It still doesn't. China grew stronger, by taking advantage of our open markets; but it also grew less free.
President Donald Trump deserves credit for upending this bipartisan consensus. He made both parties take off their blinders. Despite the divisions in our politics today, both parties are now more clear-eyed about the Chinese threat than they have been in a very long time. That's a good thing.
But being clear-eyed is not enough. It's not the same as having the right solutions and the necessary determination to protect America.
President Trump was almost singularly focused on our trade relationship with China. He was right about Chinese trade abuses. It was, and still is, a critical issue.
But Trump did too little about the rest of the Chinese threat.
He did not put us on a stronger military foothold in Asia.
He did not stop the flow of American technology and investment into the Chinese military.
He did not effectively rally our allies against the Chinese threat.
Even the trade deal he signed came up short when China predictably failed to live up to its commitments.
He also showed moral weakness. In his zeal to befriend President Xi, Trump congratulated the Communist Party on its 70th anniversary of conquering China. That sent the wrong message to the world. Chinese Communism must be condemned, never congratulated.
China was militarily stronger when President Trump left office than when he entered.
That's bad. But Joe Biden's record is much worse.
The list of President Biden's failures on China is long.
He has refused to seriously investigate China's cover-up of COVID's origins.
He has done little to stop the expansion of China's footprint on our homeland.
He has failed to address China's major role in the fentanyl crisis.
He has weakened our own military.
His obsessive focus on climate issues naively plays into China's negotiating hand.
And the situation is getting worse.
Secretary of State Blinken's visit last week was a gold-plated invitation for more Chinese aggression, not less. Just look at what happened. First, China scolded us. Then President Xi pronounced it a good meeting. He only says that when he gets a lot more than he gives. In fact, he gave us nothing.
Joe Biden has eighteen more months in office. Mark my words: He's going to keep ignoring the Chinese threat. We'll have wasted four more years.
We're falling behind. But China is moving forward, faster than ever.
Its military is modernizing and expanding at a rapid pace.
It's building infrastructure around the globe that can be used by its military.
It has new stealth bombers. It's preparing to fight in outer space. It has hypersonic missiles that we don't.
The Chinese Navy is especially concerning. Less than ten years ago, it was about the same size as ours. Today it has the largest fleet in the world, with 340 ships, and plans to hit 400 in the next two years.
We don't have plans to hit 350 ships in the next two decades.
China has dramatically expanded its cyber capabilities. Its hackers and spies are targeting everything from our military bases to our critical energy infrastructure.
China has also deepened its infiltration of our homeland. It's exerting influence on campuses and even setting up police stations on U.S. soil.
And China's abuse of American businesses is worse than ever. Every U.S. company that works in China is effectively required to support the Chinese military. They don't have a choice.
The Communist Party is stealing our innovations to the tune of $600 billion a year. It's using American enterprise to undermine American strength. And President Biden is letting it happen.
The Communist Party's end game is clear.
China is preparing its people for war.
President Xi has openly said it.
We should take him at his word and act accordingly.
Instead, President Biden continues to dither.
His action makes conflict more likely.
We must act now to keep the peace and prevent war.
And we need a leader who will rally our people to meet this threat – on every front.
As President, my top priority will be strengthening America's economy and America's military. We will protect America's prosperity and homeland from Chinese aggression.
We will tackle Chinese meddling in our society and its manipulation of our economy. And we will hold the Communist Party accountable, while putting it on the global defensive.
This is a sea-change in American policy. It's grounded in the reality that our leaders have failed to admit.
China is much more than a mere ""competitor.""
Communist China is an enemy. It is the most dangerous foreign threat we've faced since the Second World War.
We have to stop wasting time. That was true four years ago, when I said as much in Seoul. It is more so today.
It is time to marshal our strength and national will.
AN AMERICAN RESPONSE
We must respond in three ways: domestically, economically, and militarily.
Confronting China starts at home. We must systematically eliminate its interference and infiltration of our society.
The situation is worse than most people realize. The Communist Party has abused our openness in extraordinary ways.
It uses our economic freedom to threaten our security and food supplies – our academic freedom to corrupt our students and scholars – and our freedom of speech to spread lies and shape our laws.
China treats our homeland like its personal playground.
In recent years, Chinese investors have bought nearly 400,000 acres of land in our country. That's twice the size of New York City.
We aren't just talking about any old property. China has bought miles of farms near sensitive military facilities. And China has taken majority control of agricultural industries.
This must end. The line between Chinese investors and the Chinese Communist Party is exceptionally thin. The national security risk is too great. We must prevent China from buying more land, and force it to sell what it already owns.
We need similar resolve in our higher education system.
China has set up so-called ""Confucius Institutes"" that spread communist propaganda on college campuses. When they get shut down, they quickly re-open under different names.
And China is giving hundreds of millions of dollars to our universities. This funding gives Beijing a foothold in the best research institutions in the world. It wants our research for its military.
We should end this practice. We should ban all propaganda centers and eliminate federal funding for universities that take Chinese money.
Universities must choose – China or America. It shouldn't be a hard decision.
There are other steps we must take to protect our domestic institutions.
Right now, the United States lets Chinese companies lobby our government. Yet Beijing ultimately controls them. These businesses are basically front groups for a foreign power.
We should ban all lobbying from the Communist Party and Chinese companies and prevent former Members of Congress and military leaders from lobbying on China's behalf. Beijing should never be allowed to influence our laws.
China is also behind the fentanyl crisis that's killing tens of thousands of Americans a year. Chinese companies make nearly all the precursor chemicals that Mexican cartels turn into fentanyl. China cannot plead innocence here. It knows exactly what it's doing by putting these chemicals into the hands of the cartels.
We've tried sanctions but they're not working. We must ratchet up the pressure. As president, I will push Congress to revoke permanent normal trade relations until the flow of fentanyl ends.
If China wants to start normal trade again, it has to stop killing Americans.
That brings me to the second big policy shift.
In addition to protecting our homeland, we must protect our economy.
I'm a firm believer in economic freedom.
But it has long been recognized that not all trade with all trading partners is the same. The father of capitalism, Adam Smith, wrote in The Wealth of Nations, that Great Britain's interest in preserving naval supremacy was more important than free trade in the maritime sector. ""Defense,"" he wrote, ""is of much more importance than opulence.""
The challenge today is that national security is affected by almost every part of our relationship with China.
No one understands that better than the Chinese. They have desperately pursued American investment and innovation precisely to strengthen their military.
American companies are banned from selling military hardware and services to China, but they still sell billions of dollars' worth of other goods in the Chinese market.
We must look at these sales through a national security lens. Much of it has military application and slips through cracks in U.S. law. But Chinese law requires U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies as part of the price of doing business on Chinese soil.
This cannot continue.
U.S. businesses must recognize the threats to themselves and to American security. Beijing's focus on military fusion demands it.
China already steals up to $600 billion of American intellectual property every year. Our loss is the Chinese military's gain.
Advanced technology is especially important. Right now, our federal government keeps a detailed list of the most sensitive technologies that are dangerous to export. But it's not a blacklist. We still let companies send this tech to China. They just have to file the right application.
It happens all the time. In 2022, the Biden administration approved 70% of licenses for exporting controlled technology to China. Think about that!
We must end the export of sensitive technology to China, full stop.
And we must keep China away from our biggest breakthroughs and cutting-edge companies. We know Beijing wants to beat America in AI, quantum computing, and a host of other advanced technologies. We also know that American innovation is still the best in the world.
The Communist Party knows it, too. Their approach is basically, ""if you can't beat 'em, then buy 'em, or steal 'em.""
We should block any Chinese purchase of an American company specializing in advanced technology. No more exports and no more acquisitions – period.
For that matter, we should have no more investments that undermine America. China can't buy certain technologies from American companies, but Americans can still invest in Chinese companies developing those same technologies.
Talk about a loophole. It's a massive one. By one estimate, U.S. portfolio investment in China rose $800 billion between 2017 and 2020 alone.
Not all this money is funding military and technology breakthroughs. But much of it is. China is using our federally invested pensions to leapfrog America.
The American people deserve better. I will protect our investors and our national security. No more investments in any company that helps the Chinese military or supports the Communist Party – period.
These steps are needed to prevent war and preserve peace. We can no longer be complicit in China's military rise.
For that matter, we cannot continue to neglect our own military. This is the third big task we must undertake.
It's time to face a hard truth. Our military strength is not where it should be. It must be transformed to meet today's and tomorrow's challenges.
We're falling behind in almost every area.
Look at recruitment. The Army, Navy, and Air Force all say they'll miss their recruitment goals this year.
China is building more hypersonic missiles by the day. Our hypersonic missile project is barely off the ground.
Or how about nuclear weapons? China now has more ballistic missile launchers than we do. It's building warheads at a rapid pace and deploying delivery vehicles we don't have.
Meanwhile, our nuclear triad is old and getting older. President Biden is considering retiring some nuclear weapons – and even canceling new ones. Few things are more foolish in our dangerous world.
China is also investing more than ever in space and cyber warfare. These are the battlefields of the future. We have a long way to go, and in many respects, we're playing catch up.
A stronger military is the linchpin to our national security and to preventing wars.
Some might wonder if such a build-up is possible in a short timeframe. Our supply chain dependence on China makes it a serious challenge. But it must be done, and it can be done.
The Pentagon has gotten lazy. Its procurement projects drag on for decades. We must cut through the bureaucracy, stop playing favorites with defense companies, and bring new weapons and projects to the field in record time.
We can't wait fifty years for new ships and missiles. We can't even wait five years. If China can do it, America can too. And we can do it far better.
We must also rally more nations to our side. We should deepen our military ties with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, and forge stronger bonds with India and the Philippines.
And we must finally get Europe to recognize that China threatens it as much as us. European countries are even further behind than we are in recognizing the Chinese threat. It's time to shake them from their slumber.
We need a united front across the world. And one U.S. partner is especially important.
Taiwan is the Communist Party's most immediate target. If China invades, it will trigger the war that none of us want. We cannot let that happen.
We and our allies should give Taiwan everything it needs to defend itself. We should make sure the American naval presence in the Taiwan Strait remains strong. And we should let China know now that an invasion of Taiwan would not just be met with a few slap-on-the-wrist sanctions.
It would mean a full- blown economic decoupling that would massively damage China.
We should stand with Taiwan without apology – because our security is intertwined.
CONCLUSION
The actions I have laid out today were needed yesterday. They should be implemented tomorrow.
Sadly, President Biden has shown he is not up to the task. A new president is needed – one who will do what's necessary to defend America.
But there's one thing that needs to happen before next year's election. In fact, it must happen now.
The United States must help Ukraine defeat the Russian invasion. A Russian defeat would be an enormous loss for China – and a true victory for peace.
The events of this past weekend show how weak and shaky the Russian leadership is. Now is the time to seize the moment and help Ukraine bring this war to a decisive end.
Make no mistake: China is watching the war in Ukraine with great interest.
And what has it seen so far?
It has seen the failure of Russian aggression. It has seen the Russian military weakened for a generation. It has seen an unusual level of European unity, and previously neutral European countries join the western alliance. And it has seen a strengthened, not a weakened, Ukrainian resolve.
China is seeing what it most fears if it invaded Taiwan.
But that could change in short order.
If America and the West abandon Ukraine, and Russia succeeds in taking its territory and freedom, China will hear an unmistakable message. That message can only encourage China to invade Taiwan as soon as possible.
The warning signs are already flashing. President Biden has been far too slow and weak in helping Ukraine. He has dragged out this war and given Russia and China reason to question our future commitment. That's a recipe for more war in both Europe and Asia.
Our policy should not be to freeze the war on the current frontlines. That would only lead to stalemate and continued fighting. Our policy should be to help Ukraine reclaim its territory – and bring this war to a quick and decisive end. That does not require American troops or cash assistance. It requires us and our allies to supply the equipment, ammunition, and training to get the job done.
If we do that, China will see our resolve and rethink its plans for Taiwan. It will see the true cost of war before it launches one. It will realize that America will not roll over – that we will do what is necessary to defend our interests and defeat our enemies.
That is the surest way to peace. If we had sent this message years ago, there would have been no Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Chinese aggression would have been curbed.
China has spent decades preparing to fight. It has played us like a fiddle. Our leaders have responded with apathy, and even applause.
This inaction has weakened America and strengthened China. We're now in a very dangerous situation against a very powerful enemy.
The hour is late. But it is not too late to wake up and take charge of our destiny.
Peace depends on it. Our freedom demands it.
If we rally now, the Chinese Communist Party will eventually end up on the ash-heap of history, like the Soviet Communist Party.
We still have the power to protect our country. We only need courage and leadership to meet this threat head-on.
Now is the time to stand up to China. And we must stand together to save America.
Thank you.

"Pence Campaign Press Release - Mike Pence: It's time ""to take a step back"" from Trump's First Step Act Amid Crime Surges",2023-06-26T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-mike-pence-its-time-take-step-back-from-trumps-first-step-act,"
by Julia Johnson
June 26, 2023
Contrasting himself with his ex-running mate, former Vice President Mike Pence is expressing skepticism about the landmark criminal justice reform measure passed during the Trump-Pence administration. The First Step Act enjoyed the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as reality television star Kim Kardashian.
The measure's journey through the government and signing was heavily publicized by the previous administration, with Trump touting the law as one of his greatest accomplishments. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Pence said, ""I think the time has come for us to take a step back from the First Step Act,"" citing ""the crime wave besetting many of our major cities around the country"" in his reasoning. This doesn't mean he doesn't support some criminal justice reform measures, however.
""When I was governor of Indiana, we enacted criminal justice reform, but we combined measures to introduce faith-based programs to break the cycle of recidivism with tougher penalties on serious crime,"" he explained. ""I think Congress would do well — and the next Republican president would do well — to take a step back from the First Step Act, to see how we can toughen penalties on people that are victimizing our families and perpetrating violent crimes while still promoting programs that encourage people to live honest lives going forward,"" Pence added.
…
Trump's campaign did not provide comment when contacted by the Washington Examiner. …
As Pence explained, ""The bottom line is that Joe Biden and the Democratic Left want to defund the police. And as president of the United States, I will always stand, without apology, for the men and women on the thin blue line.""

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - Ron DeSantis Releases Plan to Secure Our Border and Stop the Invasion,2023-06-26T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-ron-desantis-releases-plan-secure-our-border-and-stop-the,"
""The Biden Administration is the critical link in an illegal transnational human smuggling syndicate."" - Governor Ron DeSantis Ron DeSantis will get the job done. No excuses.
With voters and residents in Eagle Pass, Texas, today, Governor Ron DeSantis unveiled a detailed plan to secure the border once and for all. DeSantis will end Biden's border crisis by stopping the invasion, building the wall, holding cartels accountable, and working with states to enforce the law. The policy proposal follows Governor DeSantis' announcement last week of a national coalition of 90 sheriffs to fill the void for Biden's inaction at the border after signing the strongest anti-illegal immigration legislation in the country this past May.
""Joe Biden's dereliction of duty has made our southern border a disaster zone. The Biden Administration is the critical link in an illegal transnational human smuggling syndicate,"" Governor DeSantis said.*""For decades, leaders from both parties have produced empty promises on border security, and now it is time to act to stop the invasion once and for all.  As president, I will declare a national emergency on day one and will not rest until we build the wall, shut down illegal entry, and win the war against the drug cartels. No excuses. We will get it done."" *
*""Washington's status quo approach to border security is one of the biggest failures of our generation,"" ***said Texas Congressman Chip Roy. **""This crisis has decimated ranchers, killed Americans with dangerous narcotics, placed migrants in horrific situations from sex trafficking to death, and placed American national security at risk to China and cartels. Texans and our courageous DPS Troopers deserve credit for standing in the breach created by Joe Biden. We need a president in the White House who is not afraid to use the full weight of his office to build the wall, stop the flow, and force Congress to send a bill to sign to fix the laws once and for all. Ron DeSantis not only has a strong plan to secure the border - in line with our Texas plan - he has the courage to finally deliver results.""
Florida state Representative Kiyan Michael added, ""As an angel mom, I have personally experienced the painful consequences that result from illegal immigration. Ron DeSantis is the only leader I trust to finally secure our border and ensure no parent ever has to go through what I did. I proudly say with great enthusiasm that every promise Governor DeSantis has made to me as a grieving mother, he has kept. He has cracked down on illegal immigration in Florida, and he will do what others have failed to do. He will secure our border and, as president, put control of our nation's border back where it belongs: back to our beautiful United States.""
*Governor DeSantis' plan to secure the border marks the first of many detailed, forward-looking solutions to Biden's failures that the governor *will announce throughout the weeks and months ahead.
NO EXCUSES: The DeSantis Plan to Secure Our Border
NO EXCUSES: Stop the Invasion
**As president, Ron DeSantis will secure operational control of our border. **


DeSantis will end catch-and-release. If you cross illegally, you will be detained until your hearing date.


DeSantis will reimpose Remain in Mexico. If you arrive at a port of entry on the US-Mexico border claiming asylum, you will not enter the United States while your claim is being processed.


DeSantis will increase Border Patrol pay to boost recruiting and ensure the Border Patrol has the necessary staffing to stop crossings.


DeSantis will have DHS conduct a recruitment campaign targeting former military members and police officers for positions at CBP and ICE.


DeSantis will take action to end the idea that the children of illegal aliens are entitled to birthright citizenship if they are born in the United States. Dangling the prize of citizenship to the future offspring of illegal immigrants is a major driver of illegal migration. It is also inconsistent with the original understanding of 14th Amendment, and DeSantis will force the courts and Congress to finally address this failed policy.


DeSantis will close the Flores loophole that incentivizes child trafficking.


DeSantis will tax remittances from illegal aliens, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawfully present foreign nationals, and penalize countries attempting evasion.


DeSantis will end the use of Notices to Report and any government funding for non-citizen travel.


He will end the abuse of prosecutorial discretion and parole authority in immigration-related cases and deport criminal aliens.


DeSantis will work with Congress and through further executive actions to strengthen and enforce E-Verify.


DeSantis will defund and prosecute entities that aid or conspire to violate U.S. immigration laws.


He will seek changes from Congress to strengthen penalties for human trafficking, smuggling, and reoccurring illegal reentry.


DeSantis will deport visa overstays.


He will allow ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations officers to do their jobs and focus on illegal alien entries under Biden's border crisis and those with criminal records.


DeSantis will cease funding the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations engaged in facilitating illegal alien processing, human smuggling, and encouraging mass migration on behalf of the Biden administration while seeking to reprogram that money for ICE operations.


DeSantis will direct the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to reinstate Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Northern Triangle Countries immediately.


He will seek changes to give immigration judges summary disposition authority and require DOJ to greatly narrow conditions for continuance, motions, and administrative appeals.


DeSantis will sanction and restrict visas of countries who do not accept deportees.


DeSantis will work with Panama to close the Darien Gap to prevent future caravans from South American and prevent Chinese control of the Panama Canal.


He will establish priorities under the Development Finance Corporation to seek areas of opportunity with returned workforces in Central and South America for supply chain nearshoring and cooperative agreements to end migration patterns.


DeSantis will also seek additional resources for CBP personnel and technology on America's northern border. 


NO EXCUSES: Build the Wall
As president, Ron DeSantis will build the wall. No excuses.


DeSantis will use the military to assist the border patrol on day one, and they will continue to help until the wall is built.  


There are 600 miles open along the US-Mexico border. He will use every dollar available to him as President and every dollar he can squeeze out of Congress to get it done.


This will additionally include needed fiber optic security systems, lighting, and sensors for the system that CBP agents need to do their jobs.


DeSantis will order the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to clear Carrizo cane and build navigable roads along the Rio Grande for CBP border security operations.


The Left tries to make fun of a border wall, but walls work. Israel built a 152-mile-long fence along its border with Egypt. Once completed, illegal crossings dropped by more than 99% year-over-year.    


NO EXCUSES: Hold Cartels Accountable
As president, Ron DeSantis will hold the Mexican drug cartels accountable.


DeSantis will declare the Mexican drug cartels to be Transnational Criminal Organizations. He will authorize sanctions on cartels, cartel leaders, and other entities known to do business with the cartels. And we will strengthen penalties for those who traffic in fentanyl, as well as those American citizens who work with the cartels.  


DeSantis will set up a Joint Counter-Cartel Task Force to direct and prioritize anti-cartel intelligence gathering and actions by our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.  


DeSantis will convene the Organization of American States to announce new diplomatic, economic, and security initiatives to deter violent cartel activity.  


DeSantis will authorize appropriate rules of engagement at the border so that those trying to smuggle drugs into the United States are met with the use of force. Right now, cartel operatives cut through portions of the border wall with impunity and poison our communities with dangerous drugs; that ends on January 20, 2025.  


And if the Mexican government drags its feet, DeSantis will reserve the right to operate across the border to secure our territory from Mexican cartel activities. If the Mexican government won't stop cartel drug manufacturing, DeSantis will surge resources to the Navy and the Coast Guard and block precursor chemicals from entering Mexican ports.  


NO EXCUSES: Work with States to Enforce the Law
As president, DeSantis will stop DOJ from suing states when they enforce immigration laws.


DeSantis will instead uphold their Article I authority to defend their state against invasion.


DeSantis will impose firm penalties on sanctuary jurisdictions. If these lawless jurisdictions try to thwart federal immigration law, DeSantis will cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to them.  


DeSantis will seek funding to reimburse states who have been forced by Biden's border crisis to take the direct costs on the chin.  


DeSantis will remove illegal aliens from census apportionment calculations.


THE DESANTIS RECORD AS GOVERNOR
Leaders of both parties have talked about border security and illegal immigration---Governor DeSantis has acted.


He signed the nation's strongest anti-illegal immigration legislation, making E-Verify mandatory for Florida employers with more than 25 employees and suspending the licenses of any Florida employer who knowingly employs illegal aliens.


That same legislation enhances penalties for human smuggling, bans local governments from issuing identification documents to illegal aliens, invalidates ID cards issued to illegal aliens in other states, and requires hospitals to collect and submit data on the costs of providing healthcare to illegal aliens.


Governor DeSantis sent Florida state law enforcement officers and equipment to Texas in 2021, where they apprehended thousands of illegal aliens and aided in hundreds of criminal arrests for felonies including human trafficking and drug smuggling.


He issued an executive order that mobilized state law enforcement and National Guard resources to aid in the interdiction of more than 10,000 migrants attempting to land on Florida's shores.


He secured $24 million to facilitate the transport of illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard and other sanctuary jurisdictions, relieving overrun border communities and bringing the reality of the border crisis to the communities that support Biden's open border policies.


He successfully petitioned the Florida Supreme Court to impanel a statewide grand jury to examine international human smuggling networks that bring aliens to the southern border and ultimately to Florida.

"Pence Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: On Anniversary of Dobbs, Mike Pence Leads GOP Field on Life",2023-06-26T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-icymi-anniversary-dobbs-mike-pence-leads-gop-field-life,"
On the one-year anniversary of the landmark Dobbs decision, Vice President Mike Pence was the only candidate to speak at a tele-town hall to Iowa voters hosted by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and the only candidate to speak at the Students for Life National Celebrate Life Rally. Below are highlights from this morning's events and other events and headlines this week.
At the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America Iowa Tele Town Hall, Pence stated: ""The American people know our country is on the wrong track and I think they're looking for men and women in leadership at every level to take us back to those time honored conservative principles.""
""We'll continue to stand for the right to life without apology. We'll continue to take our case to our friends in Iowa and all over the country;""
""Whatever it looks like in the media, whatever it looks like in the polls, this is a nation that cherishes the inalienable right to life.""
Marjorie Dannenfelser, President of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America stated:
""In fact, you were the tip of the spear, in many ways, for what happened with many of the most important decisions that led to this overturn."" The full tele-town hall can be seen HERE. 
At the inaugural National Celebrate Life Day, hosted by Students for Life, Pence stated: ""I believe that the cause of Life is the calling of our time. We can never bring back those 62 million American lives whose voices were never heard in this world but are heard in the next, those we lost these last 50 years-but with your renewed compassion, with your renewed devotion we can someday and someday soon give all the American people, born and unborn, a new beginning for Life.""

Op-Ed by Mike Pence - Confidence in Market Principles: Why Are Some Republicans Turning Their Backs on the Free Market Principles We've Advocated for Generations?,2023-06-26T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/op-ed-mike-pence-confidence-market-principles-why-are-some-republicans-turning-their-backs,"
Ronald Reagan wisely observed in his first inaugural address, ""Government is not the solution to our problem—government is the problem."" Yet today, some conservatives are losing confidence in themselves, our movement, and our fellow Americans and are instead looking to government to be the solution to problems in the free market. This stunning about-face is of great concern to traditional conservatives like me who remain unabashed advocates of the free market, the greatest engine for prosperity in human history.
Free markets have done more than any other system to raise standards of living, generate broad-based wealth, spur technological innovation, cure debilitating illness, and improve quality of life for billions of people around the globe. The entirety of American history proves that the free market, not government, has the ultimate power to shape society for the better. So why are some Republicans turning their backs on the free market principles we've advocated for generations?
To be sure, very real problems have emerged within contemporary corporate culture in America. Boardrooms have been co-opted by the radical left. Wall Street has sold out to progressive extremists by pushing for environmental, social, and governance policies that advance left-wing goals to the detriment of shareholders and workers. Fortune 500 companies are spending millions to fill our airwaves with ads that promote gender ideology and climate alarmism as much as their products.
Not even America's pastime has been spared from this cultural crusade as Major League Baseball enables the most radical elements of the left while ostracizing generations of fans. But the answer to such challenges is not to demand government intervention—it is to use free market principles to fix the free market itself. That is exactly what is happening around the country. After Bud Light drew controversy for embracing progressive gender politics, sales plummeted nationwide. In recent weeks, the same thing has happened to Target for similar reasons. Shares of both companies have suffered substantial losses. Without government lifting a finger, woke companies are being called to account for their ideological excesses. Another prominent example is Disney, a company that trumpeted its left-wing values by condemning conservative education and parental rights reforms in Florida.
Governors around the country are right to pursue these policies and protect our kids. But when the governor of Florida decided to launch a full-scale campaign of governmental retribution against Disney, he wasn't taking a page out of the conservative playbook—he was following in the footsteps of the radical left. In doing so, he not only risked billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs for the state, but even more importantly, he turned his back on the principles that make our country great. None of this was necessary. The best way to change businesses' behavior is to hit them where it hurts—the pocketbook.
The American people seemingly understand this truth, as evidenced by their grassroots boycotts and changes in purchasing habits. The bottom line is this: Conservatives can either be for politically motivated government intervention in the private sector, or we can be against it. The left has long abused the reins of power and the constitutional order to serve its goals and punish its enemies.
From President Barack Obama's weaponization of the IRS against conservative groups to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's attacks on Walgreens for putting the law and women's safety above abortion politics, to Colorado bureaucrats forcing Christians like Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop to choose between their businesses and their beliefs, the progressive left has wreaked havoc on our country and our timeless principles.
Some Republicans would have us all emulate them and become progressive conservatives. We shouldn't listen to them. We do not need to abandon our principles in order to win. We simply need leaders with the courage to speak hard truths, and faith that the American people will rally to our cause.
Now as always, the physicians of the American soul must resist the temptation to put what is popular over what is wise.

"Pence Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Pence Takes Aim at Failed Midterm Trump Picks: ""Focused on Re-litigating the Past""",2023-06-25T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-icymi-pence-takes-aim-failed-midterm-trump-picks-focused-re,"
by Julia Johnson June 25,2023
Former Vice President Mike Pence believes focusing on the 2020 election, during which he and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, lost to President Joe Biden, was ""not a prescription for success"" in the 2022 midterm elections. Questioning the 2020 election was something of a requirement for those who enjoyed the approval of the former president. Several of Trump's endorsed candidates ultimately lost in pivotal races during the 2022 midterm elections after beating out other, perhaps more palatable, Republicans in their respective primaries.
…
Shortly after the 2022 races, Trump blamed the ""abortion issue"" for the Republican Party's relative under-performance. ""poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on No Exceptions, even in the case of Rape, Incest, or Life of the Mother, that lost large numbers of Voters,"" he wrote at the time, also shifting blame to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for not supporting his senate candidates enough. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Pence expressed disappointment in Trump for this suggestion.
""To see my former running mate now blaming the pro-life movement for election losses in the midterms and the saying that certain state legislation is 'too harsh,' I think is a departure from the commitment to the right to life that was at at the center of our administration,"" he said. According to him, ""I believe when you look across the country that those candidates that stood with equal measure of principle and compassion on the right to life did quite well.""
…
Pence believes that he and other Republicans ought to focus on more pressing issues for Americans right now, rather than past elections. When it comes to the economy, which is ranked as the most important issue for voters in 2024, he explained that ""the American people are hurting. I mean, two thirds of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck.""
…
Pence further hit the Biden administration for high spending, ""the worst inflation in 40 years,"" as well as high prices for gasoline and increased utility costs. ""I think taking that case, to the people of this country, is how we prevailed in many of those competitive midterm races,"" Pence said. ""But it's all about being focused on the future. elections are always about the future."" The Indiana Republican reiterated that ""it was candidates that were focused on the past — candidates who were focused on re-litigating the past, particularly the 2020 election, that did not fare well."" This is ""because the American people long for principled, conservative leadership that will stand and articulate a vision for how we restore American prosperity and security going forward,"" he explained.
According to Pence, ""They want to see they want to see leaders that are focused on the disastrous policies of the Biden administration and how we turn this country around and restore prosperity and security,"" and not the focus that Trump and his selected candidates adopted.

WASHINGTON D.C. – Presidential candidate Nikki Haley released the following statement on the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision.
""The Dobbs decision was a victory for life and democracy. As a result, states have passed life-saving laws and helped promote a culture of life across the nation. The fight is far from over. There should be broad consensus at the federal level to end late-term abortion, make adoption easier, support pregnant mothers, and safeguard religious liberties. More must be done, and as president, I will never stop trying to save as many babies and support as many mothers as we can.""

Pence Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: WSJ: Pence Says Trump May Ditch Conservatives,2023-06-24T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-icymi-wsj-pence-says-trump-may-ditch-conservatives,"
WSJ Opinion: Mike Pence Says Donald Trump May Ditch ConservativesBy Kyle Peterson
June 16, 2023
Among the oddities of the 2024 presidential campaign is a contest between a former president and his vice president. Why should Republican primary voters favor Mike Pence over the man who put him on the ticket seven years ago? ""Donald Trump promised to govern as a conservative, and we did for four years,"" Mr. Pence says. ""He makes no such promise today. I mean, with regard to a whole range of issues, he and a few others in this field are moving away from a traditional conservative agenda.""
During a visit to the Journal this week, Mr. Pence cites three of those defections. First, Mr. Trump's ""ambiguous"" stance on aiding ""Ukraine's fight for freedom."" Second, Social Security and Medicare: ""Donald Trump's policy is identical to Joe Biden's on entitlement reform."" Third, abortion. Mr. Trump blames the end of Roe v. Wade for the GOP's 2022 doldrums. ""I believe,"" Mr. Pence says, ""that the cause of life has been the animating core of our movement for 50 years, and that the American people and Republicans long to see leadership that remains dedicated to the principle of restoring the sanctity of life to the center of American law.""
...
Republicans need to ""resist the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principle,"" Mr. Pence says. It's an interesting argument for this particular Tuesday afternoon in New York. 
...
Perhaps not everyone, on the other hand, can credibly argue that Mr. Trump is abandoning the conservative principles that Mr. Pence has championed for half a lifetime. Before he was Indiana governor and vice president, Mr. Pence served 12 years in the House, including when George W. Bush's ""compassionate conservatism"" was the fashion. ""I was battling against the big spenders in my own party back when they were trying to pass No Child Left Behind and the Medicare prescription-drug bill,"" Mr. Pence says. He voted against both.
Mr. Pence still thinks federal spending is unsustainable, and now the cliff is two decades closer. ""We sit here today with a national debt the size of our nation's economy for the first time since World War II,"" he says. Based on Congressional Budget Office numbers, ""that grows by another $120 trillion in the next 25 years."" At that point, all options will be bad: ""According to the economists that I respect, you're either going to have to double payroll taxes in the country or import some kind of a European-style welfare-state taxation system.""Mr. Pence cites his three young grandchildren. ""I think we owe them better than walking by on the other side of the road,"" he says. With the trust funds set to run dry soon, doing nothing isn't a viable plan: Under existing law, ""if you don't take this on and pass reforms, you know, in the next five to eight years, Social Security and Medicare will be faced with mandatory cuts."" His pitch is that anyone over 40 will collect benefits under current rules. For younger Americans, ""we ought to replace New Deal programs with a better deal.""He supports ideas like slowly phasing in a higher retirement age but also—and here he agreed with President Bush—letting workers invest some of their payroll taxes, via the Thrift Savings Plan that government workers use for retirement. Even a modest return could ""double what you're getting right now in Social Security.""
On world affairs, Mr. Pence cites the Reagan Doctrine, America's history of ""forward-leaning policy"" to support anticommunist forces, and its role as ""the arsenal of democracy."" Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both parties seem to be winging it. ""My former running mate said he couldn't say who should win,"" Mr. Pence laments, citing Mr. Trump's comments recently at a CNN town hall. ""We've got other people that have said it's not in our national interest to be there.""
That's an apparent knock on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who argued this year it wasn't a ""vital national interest"" to become ""further entangled"" in Ukraine.As for Mr. Biden, ""when he was asked if the United States would get involved, he said, well, it just depends, if it was a little invasion,"" Mr. Pence recounts. ""He's been incredibly slow in providing resources to Ukraine,"" and Mr. Biden as well has failed to articulate ""what our national interest is there, which is not the broad brush of 'democracy in the world,' for heaven's sakes.""As Mr. Pence lays it out: ""Checking Russian aggression in Eastern Europe is in our nation's interest, because it wouldn't be too long before they'd cross a border that we would have to send our servicemen and -women,"" under NATO's mutual defense treaty. Add in a dash of realpolitik: ""In one short year, Russia has gone from the second-most-powerful military in the world to the second-most-powerful military in Ukraine. That's a good thing."" Finally, Mr. Pence says Xi Jinping ""is going to make decisions about China's ambitions based on what the outcome is in Ukraine, I have no doubt in my mind.""
...
As for Roe v. Wade, Mr. Trump appointed three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it. He also said the GOP's feeble performance last November was due to the ""abortion issue,"" and he's cagey about what to do next. Not so Mr. Pence, who rejects the theory that the high court gave abortion back to the states alone. ""They actually returned it to the states and to the American people,"" he says. ""The American people elect presidents. They elect senators. They elect congressmen.""

Pence Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: POLITICO: Pence Leans in on Abortion Politics,2023-06-24T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/pence-campaign-press-release-icymi-politico-pence-leans-abortion-politics,"
Saturday marks one year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, revoking the constitutional right to abortion it had established. And ever since, Republicans have been twisting themselves in knots over how to handle the fallout.
Former President Donald Trump avoids talking about the matter almost entirely. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban in the middle of the night in April, and has barely spoken about it since. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) originally waffled on whether he'd support a nationwide abortion ban. And former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been vague about how she'd handle the issue as president.
Then there's former Vice President Mike Pence.
More than any other Republican candidate, the former vice president has staked his pitch to voters on his unabashed ""pro-life"" stance.
...
And this weekend, while Pence is among a parade of 2024 hopefuls addressing evangelical conservatives at the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference in Washington, he is the only candidate who'll also speak at the Students for Life rally on the National Mall, in addition to being the only candidate invited to address a nationwide Susan B. Anthony List call for activists commemorating the end of Roe.
...
— The GOP, Pence said, faces a choice: ""Whether or not we're going to continue to be a party grounded in the conservative principles that have won not only the White House, but won majorities over the last 50 years again and again — or whether our party is going to shy away from those core traditional principles.""
...
But asked if there should be a litmus test for Republicans to carry the ""pro-life"" label, Pence suggested they should all be supporting a nationwide abortion ban. ""I would expect that pro-life voters around the country would … be looking for men and women willing to stand unambiguously for advancing the cause of the right to life at every level — at the state and federal level.""

Scott Campaign Press Release - Tim Scott Celebrates The One Year Anniversary Of The Dobbs Decision,2023-06-24T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-tim-scott-celebrates-the-one-year-anniversary-the-dobbs,"
CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott celebrated the first anniversary of the Dobbs Decision with a speech at Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, a new digital ad, and an op-ed in The Des Moines Register.
To note the first anniversary of Dobbs, Tim told the Faith and Freedom audience on Friday: ""Thank God Almighty for the Dobbs decision. We are creating a culture of life in America, and that's a really good thing... The radical left has lost so much faith in America. They've lost faith in life itself. But we are here to tell 'em life is good and we are proud to be Americans. We are proud to live in the freest, fairest land on God's green earth.""
Writing in The Des Moines Register on Friday, Tim celebrated the Dobbs decision and shared the next steps for the pro-life movement: ""I am 100% pro-life. When I am president of the United States, I will sign the most pro-life legislation the House and Senate can put on my desk. We should begin with a 15-week national limit. Poll after poll shows that a clear majority of Americans oppose abortion in the second trimester and agree it should be restricted. Which raises the real question: Why is the radical left OK with aborting babies up until the day they are born? Now that Dobbs has returned the decision back to ""We the People,"" Americans will be able to actively voice their support for life in a way they haven't been able to in more than 50 years.""
Additionally, the campaign released a new digital ad, ""Gospel Truth,"" to mark the anniversary. In the ad, Tim slams the Left's radical views on the issue of abortion.

""Texas and Louisiana are doing everything they can to enforce security at our southern border despite the crisis caused by the Biden Administration's egregious failure to faithfully execute our immigration laws.

...
In a recent exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner, presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) made the case that he represents the GOP's best shot at successfully reframing the national conversation about abortion and drawing converts to the pro-life cause.
""We have to be pro-life even after birth, not just pro-life before birth,"" Scott told the Washington Examiner. ""Pro-life cannot be 40 weeks. It has to go into the first years of a child's life.""
This is an especially crucial pivot for the GOP to make in the post-Roe era since the cost of childbirth alone is seen as prohibitive to many women. Even parents with private health insurance can expect to pay as much as $3,000 for delivery alone. This is particularly galling considering that Obamacare-compliant health insurance policies cover the cost of contraceptives and even abortions, but not childbirth or prenatal care. And given the constant demonization of crisis pregnancy centers in our media, it's no surprise that pregnant women feel that abortion is their only choice; it is incentivized at every turn.
In order to reverse this system, Scott is co-sponsoring legislation that would extend the child tax credit to women at the moment when they become pregnant, not when the child is born. In addition, Scott continues to promote policies that funnel resources to women in need and to nonprofit organizations that cultivate a culture of life through block grants.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley is Right — Biden is Weak on China,2023-06-23T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-right-biden-weak-china,"
The Hill by Liz Peek
Nikki Haley wants Joe Biden to get tough on China.
Haley, a former ambassador to the United Nations and 2024 GOP hopeful, writes in The Washington Post that, ""The story of the Biden administration's approach to China has been weakness."" She is correct but should have added: weakness and utter confusion.
Just recently, President Biden trampled on his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, when he described Chinese President Xi Jinping as a ""dictator"" in remarks to a donor group in California. Our addled president's characterization infuriated his Chinese counterpart and likely undid whatever progress Blinken had made in rebooting relations with our largest rival and adversary.
This is not Biden's first ""oops"" moment regarding China. On several occasions the president has vowed to defend Taiwan, obliterating decades of ""strategic ambiguity"" over our posture toward that independent island. In each instance, the White House has had to walk back Biden's intemperate remarks.
As Haley searches for daylight in the crowded Republican forest, she is smart to fasten on Biden's China policy. Americans, alerted by Donald Trump — possibly his most important legacy — to Beijing's long-time theft of intellectual property, unfair trade practices, human rights atrocities and cheating on international commitments, rightly distrust China and expect our government to protect our interests.
That distrust has only grown as evidence mounts that COVID-19 escaped from a lab in Wuhan and as China has moved closer to Russia. It was also fed by the shocking sight of Beijing's giant spy balloon (now deemed ""silly"" by our president) wafting over our nation and by news that China and Cuba are planning to open a joint military training base some 100 miles off our shores. Each of these events has been downplayed by the Biden White House; its timidity is inexcusable and inexplicable.
In anticipation of Blinken's recent trip to Beijing, Haley suggested five questions that our secretary of State should pose to his Chinese counterparts, including why China appears to be preparing for war, abusing our economy, and infiltrating our country and our hemisphere. The former South Carolina governor also wanted Blinken to let China know that we will ""help Taiwan protect itself"" because it is ""in our interest.""
These are the muscular issues on the table — issues that are at the heart of our conflict with China. Blinken did not appear to make progress on a single one. The image we have of his visit is a widely publicized photo of our secretary of State walking forward, hand eagerly outstretched towards a reserved, stationary President Xi — a U.S. supplicant on full display.
The Biden-loving media has tried to cast Blinken's visit as a win. They mostly spared U.S. audiences the humiliation of knowing that Xi gave the U.S. secretary of State just 35 minutes and the foreign ministry afterward dismissed the meeting as a mere ""courtesy.""
Meanwhile, Blinken failed in his most important ambition for the trip: reestablishing military communications. Imagine: our Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin requested a meeting with his Chinese counterpart during a Pacific security summit in late May, and was turned down flat. That snub is unacceptable, but we accepted it and have gone back for more.
Instead, the two sides agreed to host a ""working group"" to consider restricting China's export of chemicals used in the manufacture of fentanyl, which killed nearly 80,000 Americans in 2021. And, we agreed to more student exchanges, and more airplane flights. Thin gruel, indeed.
Blinken, whom Xi kept dangling for days about whether the meeting would even take place, was dispatched home with little to show for his efforts.
What should infuriate every American is not just that Biden's team is so eager to placate Xi. It is that they have the power dynamics backward; China needs the U.S. right now more than we need China. China's economy is faltering as the rebound from COVID-induced shutdowns has fizzled. Growth in retail sales, property investment and industrial production dropped last month, surprising forecasters. May exports, too, disappointed, declining 7.5 percent from the year before. The government has now cut interest rates three times to boost growth.
Some of these shortfalls may prove temporary, but others suggest long-term problems. Urban youth employment is above 20 percent — a dangerous and destabilizing development. The population is declining and wealthy people are fleeing the country; the Economist reported that ""some 10,800 high-net-worth individuals, who have an average wealth of $6m, left the country"" last year. That $65 billion outflow is likely just the beginning.
China's biggest challenge is rock-bottom consumer confidence, which is holding back domestic spending. This is not surprising. Xi's COVID lockdowns were gruesome and he has attacked wealth — and specifically tech — entrepreneurs, which has scared off foreign investors. Just lately, talking to China's youths, Xi advised them to ""eat bitterness""; meaning, suck it up, life isn't going to get better.
He may be correct. Xi has made doing business increasingly difficult for international firms operating in China. The Economist reports that officials have raided companies, including Bain and Mintz, a U.S. due-diligence firm, using ""vaguely worded laws concerning data, intellectual property and national security."" The magazine calls the stepped-up attacks ""a tax on global business."" These complications will not impact multi-nationals attracted to China's huge markets, but they are driving smaller firms out.
This was the backdrop for Antony Blinken's visit. As Haley writes, our government should ""show American strength and resolve."" With the world's leading military and economy, we should be operating from a position of strength, but the Biden White House does not act that way. Someone should tell our president that in representing the U.S., he really is ""The Big Guy"" when it comes to China.

Des Moines Register
Senator Tim Scott
June 23, 2023
Link: HERE
One year ago this week, a generation of prayers, votes, and marches for life paid off in an historic victory. I was proud to vote to confirm Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, and I have never been prouder than I was last June 24 when they ignored the angry mobs, followed the Constitution, and overturned Roe v. Wade. The Dobbs decision further bolstered the right to life and allowed our nation to begin repairing a terrible decision.I will never pretend to know what a woman goes through when making this difficult decision, but I have provided a listening ear when dear friends of mine have experienced this life-changing choice themselves. In one friend, I saw the sadness and regret that followed in abortion's wake. In another, I saw the peace and joy that came with choosing life. Watching both sides of that choice play out firsthand opened my eyes even wider. Witnessing the emotional scars that accompany that irreversible decision, in contrast to the love and hope that accompany life, only further cemented my belief that both mothers and their innocent children deserve our support, the chance to live and the opportunity to grow.
I am pro-life and proud of it. I was already on the side of life before I became a Christian. Regardless of your faith, life is a beautiful gift! I happen to believe it's a gift from God, and as such, has intrinsic and irreplaceable value.
Modern science keeps confirming what our hearts already know — unborn children are living human beings. In recent years, new ultrasound technology allows us to meet babies as early as 15 to 20 weeks as they yawn, stretch, and suck their thumbs.
The month before the Dobbs ruling last year, President Joe Biden's Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, appeared before one of my Senate committees and suggested that abortion is necessary for women to succeed financially. I couldn't believe how coldly and recklessly this top Biden official had tossed out such a disgusting, depraved statement. The gift of life is one that we are ALL entitled to as Americans. None of us should accept a society where the value of any life can be reduced to dollars and cents.
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — despite what Janet Yellen wants you to believe, you don't have to pick just two.
I am 100% pro-life. When I am president of the United States, I will sign the most pro-life legislation the House and Senate can put on my desk. We should begin with a 15-week national limit. Poll after poll shows that a clear majority of Americans oppose abortion in the second trimester and agree it should be restricted. Which raises the real question: Why is the radical left OK with aborting babies up until the day they are born?
Now that Dobbs has returned the decision back to ""We the People,"" Americans will be able to actively voice their support for life in a way they haven't been able to in more than 50 years.
But winning long-term victories for life will take more than just lawsuits and legislation. We also need to change hearts and minds and rebuild an American culture of life that applies before, during, and after birth. Life is a gift, but what we do with it is up to us. By providing opportunities and support to women and their children, there's no telling how high they can climb.
Our pro-life principles are always righteous. When they're communicated with clarity and love, they're attractive, too. Our movement needs a persuader-in-chief who can take our message to unexpected places, break through the liberal lies, and unite people around the dignity of every human life.
As president, I will show the world that while the decision is hard, and life can be harder, it's a beautiful gift that we must never take for granted. When we support, protect, and defend innocent life, we will overcome challenges, achieve amazing things, and unlock greater treasures than anyone could have imagined.
Tim Scott is a U.S. senator from South Carolina and a Republican candidate for president.

""We are creating a culture of life in America and that's a really good thing.""
WASHINGTON, D.C. – This morning, Tim Scott spoke at Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference in Washington, D.C. Tim discussed the one year anniversary of the Dobbs' decision, personal attacks from the radical Left, and the corruption of the Biden administration.
Watch the full speech here
Below are excerpts from Tim's delivered remarks:
We have to start with tomorrow's anniversary and thank God Almighty for the Dobbs' decision. We are creating a culture of life in America, and that's a really good thing....
The radical left has lost so much faith in America. They've lost faith in life itself. But we are here to tell 'em life is good and we are proud to be Americans.
I said that because not only was Secretary Yellen, but then the ladies on the View, Joy Behar told me, I don't know what it feels like to be Black.
I was like, let me go on that show and have a conversation with the women of The View, because I gotta say their comments were offensive and dangerous and disgusting. And so I went on the view and said, your comments are offensive, dangerous, and disgusting. Because to suggest that the only way for a child of color to make it in this nation is to be the exception and not the rule is a lie from the pit of hell alive, from the pit of hell. But then President Obama decided to jump in as well.
He says, I'm too optimistic. I have been accused of being too optimistic, too positive, too proud to be an American for those accounts. I am guilty. Guilty, yes. Charged. I love America. I love our country....
In this radical left Biden administration, they weaponized the Department of Justice against their political enemies. That is wrong. We deserve better in the United States of America. We deserve better, I wish, and as president of the United States, I would change the trajectory of this nation by focusing on restoring confidence and integrity in the DOJ because we will first fire Joe Biden, second fire, Merrick Garland. Third, fire Chris Wray at the FBI.

Hurd Campaign Press Release - Will Hurd Announces 2024 Bid for President on CBS Mornings,2023-06-22T00:00:00+00:00,Will Hurd,/documents/hurd-campaign-press-release-will-hurd-announces-2024-bid-for-president-cbs-mornings,"
""I believe the Republican Party can be the party that talks about the future, not the past.""
Today, former U.S. Congressman Will Hurd (R-TX) announced his bid for the Republican nomination for president on CBS Mornings. Below are some highlights from his interview.
WILL HURD ON WHY HE'S RUNNING:
""We live in complicated times and we need common sense. There are a number of generational defining challenges that we're faced with in America. Everything from the Chinese government trying to surpass us as the global superpower, the fact that inflation is persistent at a time when technologies like artificial intelligence is going to upend every single industry, and our kids—their scores in math, science, and reading are the lowest they've ever been in this century.
""These are the issues we should be talking about. And to be frank, I'm pissed that we're not talking about these things. I'm pissed that our elected officials are telling us to hate our neighbors. Our neighbors are not our enemies—they're our fellow Americans who we just happen to have a disagreement with. ... I believe the Republican Party can be the party that talks about the future, not the past.
""We should be putting out a vision of how do we have unprecedented peace, how do we have a thriving economy, how do we make sure our kids have a world class education, regardless of their age and location? We can do this. It's hard. But here's one thing I've learned: If we remember two things, we can pull this off. America is better together. Way more unites us than divides us.""
WILL HURD ON HOW A DARK HORSE CANDIDATE CAN WIN:
""A dark horse candidate can pull this off. One, you can't be afraid of Donald Trump. Too many candidates in this race are afraid of Donald Trump, but we also have to articulate a different vision. All of my life, I've heard that the Republican Party was the 'big tent party.' We were the party that was willing to have competition of ideas. But unfortunately, we have got in this echo chamber and only preach to the choir. It's real easy to preach to the choir, but what we need to do is grow the choir. You have to do that in a primary and you have to do that in a general election.
""And guess what? I know how to do that. Nobody thought a Black Republican was going to win in a 72% Latino district against another Republican who had a lot of money and everyone was backing him. I was able to pull it off because I did something simple, show up to places where people don't expect you. Talk about the things they care about and that's the path, it's not easy... it's something we have to do.""

Video Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President,2023-06-22T00:00:00+00:00,Will Hurd,/documents/video-remarks-announcing-candidacy-for-president-15,"
The soul of our country is under attack. Our enemies plot, create chaos, and threaten the American Dream. At home, illegal immigration and fentanyl stream into our country. Inflation, still out of control. Crime and homelessness growing in our cities, and liberals do nothing.
President Biden can't solve these problems—or won't. And if we nominate a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump—who lost the House, the Senate, and the White House—we all know Joe Biden will win again.
Republicans deserve better. America deserves better. It's common sense. Common sense says we're better together. I know it. You know it. There's more that unites us than divides us. And America needs common sense during these complicated times.
I'm Will Hurd, and for the past 20 years, I've been on the front lines of the most pressing fights facing our nation. I hunted down terrorists in the Middle East after 9/11. In Congress, I fought to lower taxes, secure our border, and provide more opportunities for the middle class. I've worked at the highest levels of business to harness technology and innovation for the future of America.
These experiences have shown me that this moment, that this election, has never mattered more. That's why I'm running for the Republican nomination for the President of the United States.
I envision an America where the economy thrives because we harness technologies like artificial intelligence to grow American jobs, not unemployment. An America where every child, regardless of location or age, has access to a safe, world-class education. An America that acknowledges science, addresses mental health, and is inclusive and understanding.
It's not a given that this vision for America will happen, but it can if we focus on our timeless principles and limitless potential—not self-interested politics. As president, I'll put our American security and prosperity first, and I'll give us the common sense leadership America so desperately needs. I'm Will Hurd. I'm running for President, and I approve this message.

""All we're doing in Florida is having the temerity to fight back to protect the integrity of education for our kids, to protect parents' rights, to be able to send kids to school and have the school focus on the basics, and not teach a young kid that they can change their gender or that they were born in the wrong body.""
This evening, Governor Ron DeSantis joined Kayleigh McEnany on Fox News Tonight for a wide-ranging interview contrasting Florida's track record of economic success against California's failed leftist policies, his plans to take on the CCP, and the necessity of fighting culture wars head on.
Watch the full interview HERE.
HIGHLIGHTS
**Governor DeSantis on why fighting the culture wars matters: **
""Well, Kayleigh when they're trying to inject matters of gender ideology into a kindergarten or first grade classroom, just understand that is a culture war. But that's a culture war being waged by the left against parents and kids. All we're doing in Florida is having the temerity to fight back to protect the integrity of the education for our kids, to protect parents' rights, to be able to send their kid to school, and have the school focus on the basics, and not teach a young kid that they can change their gender or that they were born in the wrong body.""
Governor DeSantis on combatting the CCP:
""You know, when China was put into the World Trade Organization, and granted most favored nation status almost 25 years ago, we were told by DC elites that this would make China more free, more democratic, it'd make the world better. In reality, it hollowed out parts of our country, it made China very rich, and what has Xi used that money for? To build up more military capacity. He now has grand ambitions, not just in the Pacific, but even in our own hemisphere. And we see news where China is going to be working with Cuba to establish eavesdropping, maybe a military outpost, that's a huge, huge threat to this country. So yes, we need to declare independence from China economically. And we need to make sure that we have the ability to project the appropriate strength in the Pacific to work with our allies to deter China. China understands the language of strength. And I think what Joe Biden has done since his first day in office, he's projected weakness. A lot of bad actors around the world see that. And that really whets their appetite to be able to do things that are going to be very harmful for the world.""
Governor DeSantis on Florida vs California:  
""Even though we're only 60% of the size of California we have New--more business formations here. We have way less tax, way less debt, we have one of the lowest tax and debt burdens in the entire country. We have led amongst all big states since COVID. And economic growth, our unemployment rates 2.6%, California's is over 4%...It's a beautiful state, great topography, all kinds of diversity in terms of the different communities you can live in. And yet they never lost population until their current governor took office. Now they're hemorrhaging wealth. Now they're hemorrhaging population because you see things like what I saw the other day in San Francisco. I saw people defecating on the sidewalk. I saw people in an open-air drug market using fentanyl. I saw them using crack cocaine. I had police officers come over and shake my hand and thank me for what we're doing in Florida because they wish that they had a commitment to law and order in the state of California and in San Francisco. So, we can cite all the statistics. People vote with their feet. And if someone picks up and moves 2500 miles across the country, from California to Florida, that's a major statement.""

"Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - Obama Cynically Attacked Me After I Dared to Say America is NOT Racist. But if Democrats Get Their Way, Black and Brown Kids Will Think They're Inferior and Have No Place in Our Country",2023-06-21T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-obama-cynically-attacked-me-after-i-dared-say-america-not-racist-but-if,"
Daily Mail by Nikki Haley
You'd think the first black President of the United States would have hope and pride in America.
Not just that: You'd think he'd say that my candidacy for president – as the first female minority governor in American history – is further proof of our national progress.
But Barack Obama didn't say that. Instead, he criticized me for saying America isn't racist.
In his words, I'm one of the 'minority candidates within the Republican Party who will validate Americans saying, 'everything's great, we can make it.'
He further accused me of 'pretending as if everything's equal and fair.' He even tried to mimic me, claiming I say, 'I'm an Asian Indian American woman and my family came here and we worked hard.'
Talk about condescending. I'm proud of my parents, who moved from India to South Carolina to pursue the American Dream. Yes, they worked hard. And yes, they faced racism, but they overcame it. They taught me and my siblings that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America.
They were right. I was a brown girl in a black-and-white world, yet my state still elected me governor. And I want every little girl and boy – white, black, brown, you name it – to know they live in the best country in the world. In this country, they can grow up to be anything. Even the President of the United States.
Does Barack Obama think he's the only minority who could be elected president? It sure sounds like it. But he used to know better.
His 2008 presidential campaign was built around hope – hope in America's progress. He also used to have pride in our country.
Almost 20 years ago, in the most famous speech of his career, the then-Senator said, 'our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago.' And the future president spoke at length about the 'opportunity' that drew his family here and enabled him to achieve so much.
This is America's promise – the pursuit of happiness and opportunity for all. We've spent almost exactly 250 years striving to make it real for everyone.
How far have we come? So far that Barack Obama was elected president. So far that I am now running for president.
If America was racist, none of this would have happened – full stop. The America of 2023 would be the same as the America of 1776. But things are night-and-day different. Why? Because every generation of American citizens has stood up and stepped forward to fight for the principles of the Declaration.
That promise sparked a fire in the hearts of Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the abolitionists who brought slavery to an end. It moved the minds of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, the suffragettes, and all who fought to put women on an equal footing with men. It filled the air when Martin Luther King, Jr. told us of his dream. It was made real with the end of segregation and the victory of civil rights.
And the promise of America has been the constant in my life, Barack Obama's life, and the lives of tens of millions of other people, of every color and creed.
Do we still have more work to do? We must fight racism, discrimination, and anti-Semitism everywhere they exist. For that matter, we must break all the barriers that block people from sharing in America's promise.
We have an education system that fails students – especially in the inner city.
We have a crime wave that destroys communities and claims lives – hurting minorities the most.
We have a welfare system that traps people of all races and backgrounds in government dependence.
We have drugs like fentanyl tearing families apart – from the biggest cities to the most rural towns.
We have too many broken families, too few role models for our children, and too much trust in government, instead of in ourselves and each other.
Democrats have made these problems so much worse. Yet instead of confronting their failed policies, which are hurting millions of people, liberals are blaming America itself.
They would rather tear down our country than admit their own errors and try a different way. Barack Obama had eight years to pull our country together, but he chose to further divide us by race and gender. Now he's doubling down by accusing America of being defined by racism.
Barack Obama speaks for the leadership of the Democratic Party. If they get their way, black and brown kids will think they're inferior and have no place in America. But I will make sure every child has the best shot at the best life.
That's why I'm fighting for universal school choice, law enforcement, a secure border, work over welfare, and an economy that lifts up everyone. All these things, and more, are necessary to help everyone find opportunity and participate in America's promise.
The next president will oversee the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence – July 4, 2026. On that day, we need a leader who can say, and who proves: America is not a racist country.

MYRTLE BEACH, SC –  This evening, Tim Scott joined FOX News' Sean Hannity for a Town Hall in his home state of South Carolina. During the Town Hall Tim responded to the Hunter Biden news.
Tim ScottFOX NewsJune 20, 2023
Sean Hannity: I gotta get your reaction to the news of the day. You know, sad to say, I don't believe right now in America that we have equal justice under the law or equal application of our laws. We know that they've had this case for, plus years. Yes, we know about that 1023 form. I'd like to know what investigation they've done. We know about all this money Hunter Biden, with no experience, made. We know Joe Biden brags about leveraging a billion dollars to keep his son and the money with Burisma Holdings, nothing happened to him. I worry we don't have an equal Justice Center.
Tim Scott: It's dangerous. Let me just say we all know this, that the big guy has some explaining to do without any question, Sean. We cannot be the city on the hill if we are not first a nation of law and justice. We can't be the city on the hill, we cannot fulfill our destination, our destiny as America, if we do not have the Lady of Justice wearing a blindfold. We all have to be treated equally under the eyes and the walls of our country.
And when the Biden's get away with that, we need to thank God for Senator Grassley and Congressman Comer for doing their job. If they can't finish their investigation, President Tim Scott will finish it, with your help. We're gonna fire Joe Biden and then we're gonna fire Merrick Garland and fire Christopher Ray and we're gonna restore confidence and integrity in our Department of Justice.
We can't have them going after the pro-life activist with a SWAT team. You can't call parents who show up at a school board meeting domestic terrorists, you cannot. It is unacceptable and un-American to weaponize the Department of Justice against your political opponents. It's just wrong.

Chelsea: Hi! Senator Tim Scott, How do you plan to differentiate yourself from the other candidates in order to bring unity back to our country?
Tim Scott: Thank you, Chelsea. I will simply say that I believe America can do for anyone what she has done for me. If we focus on restoring hope, creating opportunities, and protecting the greatest land on God's green earth, that is a good start. I've also found throughout South Carolina, now in Iowa and New Hampshire, the three states where I'm campaigning, people are starving for an optimistic, positive message with a backbone and conservative principles underneath. I believe it is our responsibility to take our message to places we are not invited. I speak at every place. I've had a town hall at a Black church. I'm gonna have one in the Brazilian church. I'm doing one in the white church. I'll do one in any church, any place in the nation, because I want all of America to appreciate our conservative values. But we also have to be willing to take our messages and our beliefs and our convictions to the highest mountains, also to the deepest valleys. We've gotta do it in a gymnasium like this filled with friends, or in an inner city church surrounded by skeptics. You see, I believe that I'm not an exception. I am simply today's rule.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Vows to 'No Longer Give Money to Countries That Hate America' as President,2023-06-20T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-vows-no-longer-give-money-countries-that-hate-america,"
Washington Examiner by Julia Johnson
Presidential candidate Nikki Haley recalled her time at the United Nations during a town hall in South Carolina on Monday, detailing some of the animosity that other countries held against the United States.
Worst of all, she said, is that many of those countries were recipients of billions of dollars of foreign aid from the U.S.
""When I am president, we will no longer give money to countries that hate America,"" Haley told attendees at a town hall in Moncks Corner, South Carolina.
""There were two things that I knew that Russia, China, Iran, and our enemies never wanted America to have when I was at the U.N.,"" she said. ""They didn't want us to have a strong military, and they didn't want us to be energy independent.""
""We need to do both of those things,"" Haley said. ""Strong militaries don't start wars. Strong militaries prevent wars.""
She further said that ""when it comes to energy independence, no more going hat in hand to Saudi Arabia"" for oil or purchasing what she slammed as ""dirty oil from Venezuela or Iran.""
Haley noticed how often it felt like other countries opposed the U.S. in the U.N., so she recalled researching each member, how often they voted against the U.S., and then how much foreign aid was afforded to them by America's government.
""I took that book, and I gave it to President Trump,"" she told voters. ""He lost his mind.""
According to her, America needed to ""quit trying to buy friends. Quit paying off our enemies. Last year, we gave $50 billion in foreign aid.""
""Do you know who we gave it to?"" she asked.
""Pakistan, who harbored terrorists that tried to kill our soldiers. Iraq that has Iranian influence that says, 'Death to America,' every day. Zimbabwe, the most anti-American African country out there. Belarus, who's holding hands with Russia as they invade Ukraine,"" Haley said.
""We give money to communist Cuba, who we named a state sponsor of terrorism,"" she added.
""And the one that's the most embarrassing: We give money to China,"" she said.
Haley's campaign also announced on Monday that she would deliver a ""major foreign policy speech"" addressing China on Friday at the American Enterprise Institute.

Scott Campaign Press Release - WSJ: Why Barack Obama Attacks Tim Scott,2023-06-20T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/scott-campaign-press-release-wsj-why-barack-obama-attacks-tim-scott,"
""A Black conservative President would rebut the former President's racial and political narrative.""
Why Barack Obama Attacks Tim ScottThe Wall Street JournalThe Editorial BoardJune 19, 2023
As America's first black President, Barack Obama entered office with a promise of improving race relations and reducing political discord. Eight years later, rancor was worse as Mr. Obama's Administration exploited race as a political weapon on voting rules, criminal justice, and preferences for jobs and much more. This explains why the former President is now attacking South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott.
...Ms. Haley and Mr. Scott both rebutted the former President's patronizing comments. ""There's no higher compliment than to be attacked by President Obama,"" Mr. Scott said. ""Whenever the Democrats feel threatened, they pull out—drag out—the former President, have him make some negative comments about someone running, hoping that their numbers go down.""
Mr. Scott is right, and it's worth asking why. You'd think Mr. Obama of all people would be pleased to see minority candidates with serious credentials compete as Republicans for the White House. If both parties compete for the votes of minorities, that could make race less of a polarizing force in American life.
...Mr. Scott in particular is a threat because, as he often notes, his life story symbolizes the country's racial evolution. He has never sugar-coated America's racist history, noting how he has experienced it in his own life. But he doesn't use that as an excuse to deny progress.
His ideas to reduce poverty are also far better than Mr. Obama's default to government dependency and failing public schools. Mr. Scott wants to free minorities from union schools and escape poverty by giving them more economic opportunity. Those ideas are a dagger pointed at the heart of the progressive project that sustains a permanent underclass dependent on Democratic welfare programs. That is the real reason Mr. Obama is attacking Mr. Scott and Ms. Haley.

Sean Hannity: We've got a party that is the Democratic party today, in no way resembles the Democratic party of both.
Tim Scott: Without any question, we have to persuade people to join our team. Here's what I can tell you, I've done the surveys, I've run around the country. African Americans, around 81% want the same level of policing, or more policing, not less. That's a lie from the radical left. We have to understand that most of America wants the same thing. How many of y'all here believe in law and order? How many of y'all are thanking God almighty and willing to stand with me and back the blue?
You see, when I wrote a bill to help refund the police because the crazy left defunded the police, they called me a token because they are opposed to helping the very people they say they care about the most. How many of y'all believe that we should secure our southern border? We all believe that. We all know this to be true.
This is what I was taught, if you don't control your back door at your house, it's not your house. If you don't control your southern border, it might not be our country. Every county in America is a border county. 70,000 Americans have lost their lives to fentanyl, 70,000. The precursors come from China, they're made in manufacturing locations in Mexico, and then the Mexican cartels bringing it across our southern borders and our ports of entry. President Scott, not on my watch. We will stop this from happening without any question. We will freeze their assets and unleash the most powerful force on this earth.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Don Bolduc: Nikki Haley Has a Plan for Veterans and My Support,2023-06-19T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-don-bolduc-nikki-haley-has-plan-for-veterans-and-my-support,"
Union Leader by Don Bolduc
ONE OF the greatest travesties in Washington, D.C. is that America's veterans are still not getting the help they need. It's not for lack of effort. Congress has passed several laws to fix the mess, but like most things in Washington, it's still a mess. Fixing it will require a leader who understands that passing new laws is not enough. We have to make veterans a priority.
I went from private to sergeant to lieutenant to general over a 36-year career in the military. I know when a politician doesn't stand with our veterans and I can tell a true leader right away.
That's why I strongly support Nikki Haley for president. Her plan to help veterans is grounded in her own experience. It's exactly what our heroes need.
It's no surprise why Nikki stands with those who served. Her husband, Michael, is a combat veteran from Afghanistan, like me. She's seen the courage that defines our men and women in uniform. She understands the support they need.
Michael is preparing to deploy again this month. He's going overseas for a year. It will be hard. On the day he departs, Nikki Haley will stand by his side in a show of support. Rarely will you see a more powerful statement of support for our heroes. It's equaled by her dedication to helping our veterans.
Nikki Haley is the only candidate who has laid out a comprehensive plan to support veterans. That fact alone proves that she's set apart from the pack. It says a lot when politicians ignore veterans until it's convenient for them. Nikki knows convenience has nothing to do with it. She understands that America owes veterans a debt — a debt that can't be ignored and must be repaid.
Nikki's plan to help veterans starts by ensuring we have the world-class care we earned in the uniform.
The sad truth is that even after years of reforms, veterans are still forced to wait a month on average for primary care appointments at the VA. That's longer than most Americans. What's more, the VA under Joe Biden is reportedly fudging wait times, making it harder for veterans to get care outside the VA.
This is a scandal. Nikki will fix it. She'll give veterans the freedom to choose their own doctor even if it's outside the VA. No more waiting for the VA. No more jumping through hoops.
Nikki will also expand veterans' access to telemedicine. More than two million veterans used it during the pandemic, but that was temporary. Nikki will make telemedicine permanent, so veterans can get immediate access to care from home.
Nikki is especially focused on mental health care. As her husband can attest from the men and women he served with, the wounds of war are often hidden. She'll make mental health screening a priority — not just when veterans leave the military, but throughout their lives. And she'll end the crisis of veterans waiting months for substance abuse treatment. Considering that 33% of veterans have PTS, and one in 15 struggles with substance abuse, Nikki's plan will save the lives of many heroes.
Crucially, Nikki will light a fire under Congress to enact her plan. She's called for every member of Congress to get their health care from the VA. You can bet they'll fix it the moment they experience what veterans do every day.
But health care isn't the only challenge veterans face. That's why Nikki is calling for continuous outreach to veterans, instead of one-time help when they come home. She's going to make some veterans' benefits available to spouses and give us more choices under the GI Bill, beyond education. Nikki will empower veterans to thrive over the long haul.
Most importantly, Nikki Haley will honor veterans' service by strengthening our military.
Any veteran will tell you how disheartening it is to see the armed forces put radical politics ahead of military preparedness. The military is going woke and weak at a time when it needs to be proud and strong. Nikki will end wokeness in the military, eliminate all the DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) nonsense that's corrupting our troops, and invest in our military, so we're 10 steps ahead of enemies like China.
If anyone can do this, it's the spouse of a combat veteran, the former commander in chief of the South Carolina National Guard.

MONCKS CORNER, S.C. (WCSC) – Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley pushed her presidential campaign in the Lowcountry on Monday.
Hundreds of employees and Haley supporters gathered inside Berkeley Electric Cooperative facility to hear about her position on specific issues throughout America, and how she feels about proposed energy regulations.
Haley started the town hall meeting sharing stories and facts from her time as governor, saying how important her time was being a United States Ambassador to the United Nations for two years.
""When I became governor, South Carolina was hurting. We had double digit unemployment; we had thousands of people on welfare, and we got to work,"" she says. ""By the time I left being Governor, we were building planes with Boeing.""
She focused on the country's financial problems, educational systems, crime, the border and international relations.
""I went 400 miles down that border and you are not ready for what I saw,"" Haley says. ""Mounds of clothing, mounds of shoes, paraphernalia, rape areas where women and girls have to go through.""
""When it comes to crime, it's simple. Have the backs of our law enforcement, you need to thank them every single day,"" she adds. ""No more weak penalties around the country; we will bring law and order back.""
As for education, Haley says parents should decide where their children go to school without being mandated by a zip code.
""You as parents should never have to wonder what is being taught to your kids in school; you have every right to know what's happening,"" she says. ""No child should be educated based on where they're born and raised.""
She claims during her time at the United Nations, they did not want America to have a strong military or to be energy independent.
""We need to do both of those things; strong militaries don't start wars, strong military prevent wars,"" Haley says.
The energy panel included Berkeley Electric CEO, Mike Fuller, Central Electric Power CEO, Rob Hochstetler, and Santee Cooper CEO, Jimmy Staton.
The panel discussed proposed regulations to existing power plants, which could potentially lead to economic hardships for traditional energy sectors, resulting in higher electric bills for consumers, according to Berkeley Electric.
""They [Biden administration] are picking winners and losers; they are picking what kind of energy they think is best for America, which at the end of the day, we should be an above all type of energy,"" Haley says. ""We should want everything. Do we want renewables? Sure, we do, but we want to make sure we have every type of energy possible.""
Haley is scheduled to deliver a foreign policy speech on China at the American Enterprise Institute on Friday.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - A Different Kind of Father's Day,2023-06-18T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-different-kind-fathers-day,"
Fox News by Nikki Haley
This will be a different Father's Day for my family and many other military families in South Carolina. Later this week we'll say goodbye to my husband, Michael. He's starting a nearly year-long deployment to Africa with the South Carolina Army National Guard. He'll spend the next 12 months in the uniform of the United States, protecting his wife, our two children, and the freedoms of every American.
This isn't the first time Michael has been deployed. In 2013, he went to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. We stood with him on the morning he left. We hugged and kissed him and told him how much we love him. We hoped with every fiber of our being that he would come home safely. That nothing would happen to him. That our family would be whole again. This week, we'll do it all over again.
A deployment is basically a year-long prayer for military families like ours. It's the first thing you think about when you wake up and the last thing you think about before you go to bed. But worry isn't the only emotion you feel. It's not even the most powerful feeling that military families experience. Most of all, we feel pride. We thank God for these heroes' service to our country even as we pray for their safety.
Michael is doing what millions of patriotic Americans have done since our founding. He's putting the nation ahead of himself, out of a deep recognition that freedom is worth fighting for. That's why he joined the National Guard in 2006. It's why he still serves, nearly two decades later. When you're in the military, you're always ready to answer the call. America demands and deserves nothing less than the most you can give.
When I was governor of South Carolina, I would always remind Michael that I was his commander in chief. It always gets a good laugh, yet it also reminds us that service to our country takes many different forms. He's always supported my service, and I'll always support his. For that matter, I love and support everyone who serves in the armed forces, and their families, too. I know what they go through. And I want them to know they have my respect, and that of the whole nation.
Nothing can prepare you for the day your loved one deploys. Even when you know it's coming, saying goodbye is still one of the hardest moments of your life. You've already talked about the what-ifs and the worst-case scenarios. Yet on the day itself, when you look your loved one in the eyes, it all goes out the window.
There is so much we can do to support our loved ones while they serve. On top of the prayers, the video calls, and the care packages, every military family I know wants to honor our heroes by keeping America strong.
That means teaching our children to love our country; giving our veterans the world-class care they earned once they return; and modernizing our military so our men and women in uniform can protect themselves, each other, and our freedom – from any enemy on earth.
My husband Michael and his brothers and sisters in arms deserve all the support our country can muster. I'll keep fighting for that every day he's gone, and long after he comes home.
That's my promise to Michael on this Father's Day. Our children and I will celebrate him, even as we prepare for the challenges that lie ahead. Thank God my children have a father who shows them what it means to serve. Thank God America has so many leaders who stand up and step forward to keep us safe.

Tim ScottFOX News SundayJune 18, 2023
Tim Scott: There's no higher compliment than to be attacked by President Obama. Whenever the Democrats feel threatened, they pull out, drag out the former President and have him make some negative comments about someone running, hoping that their numbers go down. Here is what people need to know, the truth of my life disproves the lies of the radical left. You talk about addressing the issue of poverty, my opportunity zones have seen more than $50 billion go into the poorest, hardest hit communities in this country, the majority of them are minority. Think about the HBCU funding, that in his administration, he totally missed it. We took the funding for HBCUs to the highest level in the history of the country, and then Shannon, we made it permanent. And the radical left and the teacher's unions refuse to allow quality education in big blue cities. 
I support school of choice because I support common sense. The radical left and President Obama, they have failed, they have failed, and they have failed. We will make it happen under Scott, under my administration, we will make sure that kids have quality education in every single zip code. We will work on opportunity zones 2.0 to make sure that we bring more resources, more opportunities, and more jobs to the hardest hit areas, whether that's rural Iowa or inner city Chicago. There is a way for us to alleviate poverty, not by a race, but by the statistics themselves. That's what America stands for, and if anyone should be standing and shouting at the mountaintops that America is not a racist country, it should be the man that Americans supported twice for the nomination and becoming president, the evolution of a America is palpable, progress in this nation, undeniable.

""Our nation benefits by reflecting on the 8th anniversary of the greatest act of forgiveness that unified our state and nation.

The DeSantis Family joined Nevadans at local events over the weekend
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey DeSantis, and their children, Madison (6), Mason (5), and Mamie DeSantis (3), spent the weekend in Nevada. His trip to the Silver State began Friday night when Governor DeSantis and the First Lady spoke to veterans and served beers at VFW Post 9211 (""the Bunker"") in Sparks. Afterward, the DeSantis family enjoyed the 104th Reno Rodeo, and the governor was the first presidential candidate to attend the event. The trip culminated with the 8th Annual Morning in Nevada PAC's Basque Fry earlier today, where DeSantis addressed a crowd of 2,500+ as the featured speaker of the event.
""This country is in decline. But decline is not inevitable. It is a choice - a choice we, as Americans, must make over these next 18 months. I'm running for President because I want to reverse that decline. I'm not interested in being like some of these other Republicans, who will manage the decline a little better than the Democrats. I have no interest in managing decline. We are going to reverse the decline.
We will be an energetic executive. We will lean in, and we will go on offense. We're going to repeal and reverse Biden's disastrous economic policies that are making your life more difficult and making your groceries cost more.
I believe we have it within our capacity to reverse the decline in this country and restore this country to its proper greatness. That's going to be our mission over these next 18 months. We all have a role to play. We can win the state of Nevada in November of 2024. We need to win the state of Nevada in November of 2024. Make no mistake about it!""Governor DeSantis conducted with interviews with Nevada-syndicated KRNV and Megan Barth of the Nevada Globe.
The Basque heritage is rich in Nevada, and the yearly event is a proud state tradition that features music, activities for kids, and food.
Nevadans welcomed the DeSantis family with warmth and enthusiasm. As reported in the Daily Mail, Ron DeSantis ""charmed a Nevada rodeo crowd alongside his all-American family during a presidential campaign stop on Friday evening.""

Ron and Casey DeSantis dazzle Reno Rodeo crowd with three kids in tow:Florida's first family enjoys bull riding and barrel racing during campaign swing through western NevadaKatelyn CaralleJune 17, 2023Daily Mail
Ron DeSantis charmed a Nevada rodeo crowd alongside his all-American family during a presidential campaign stop on Friday evening.
The Florida governor, his wife Casey DeSantis and their three children Madison, 6, Mason, 5, and Mamie, 3, were hosted by one of the sponsors of the Reno Rodeo in a box with premium views of the arena, where a slew of attendees could walk by and shake his hand or take a selfie.
'They're in the right place,' a rodeo-goer told DailyMail.com when asked how he felt about the 2024 GOP presidential candidate attending.
Before bringing their kids to the rodeo, Ron and Casey stopped to drink beers with veterans in Reno at VFW Post 9211, also known as 'The Bunker'.
The Friday festivities came the day before Florida Gov. DeSantis will be the featured guest at the 8th Annual Morning in Nevada PAC's Basque Fry in Gardnerville, Nevada -- just under an hour outside of Reno.
Spotted alongside DeSantis at the rodeo was former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a longtime Donald Trump ally who has defected to support DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.
Laxalt and DeSantis roomed together while in naval officer training, and they have remained close friends through the years.
Both men were officers in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, and they served in Iraq.
Laxalt chaired Trump's 2020 campaign in Nevada, but this time around he is backing DeSantis, and heads up the pro-DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down.
The ten-day Reno Rodeo is a coveted annual event in western Nevada with attendees pulling out their best boots, largest cowboy hats, pressed jeans and flashiest belt buckles to watch the competitions, which includes bareback riding and barrel racing, as well as bull and Bronc riding.
Past rodeo president Scott Patterson confirmed that DeSantis is the first-ever presidential candidate to visit the Reno Rodeo.
Event organizers told DailyMail.com that DeSantis wanted to stay throughout the duration of the festivities Friday evening because his kids are big fans of bull riding, which is the finale event.
Many in the crowd eagerly anticipated DeSantis' arrival, while a few others that seemed apolitical told DailyMail.com that they were only vaguely aware of the 2024 candidate.
The general manager of a local Reno and Tahoe-based business who was attending the rodeo on Friday evening said that he plans to change his registration from independent to Republican so he can vote for DeSantis in the primary election.
Richard Harrison, 45, told DailyMail.com that he voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, but said he's 'too crazy,' so he switched his vote to Joe Biden in 2020.
But the Nevada voter said he fears that Biden is 'too old' to continue being president, and now backs DeSantis.
At the rodeo, DeSantis shook hands as he walked out to the bleachers after privately meeting with the event's sponsors.
Many prospective voters approached DeSantis to take pictures as he settled into the box.
Though far from the Sunshine State, DeSantis looked to be right at home, donning the black pair of boots he is often seen wearing at campaign events with jeans, along with a white quarter zip on top of a light blue and plaid button down.
Casey, who is quickly becoming a fashion icon and drawing comparisons to former First Ladies Jackie Kennedy and Nancy Reagan, wore a cobalt blue zip-up over a white t-shirt and jeans.
The three kids were in matching 'RD24' navy blue shirts promoting their father's 2024 bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The family of five all wore cowboy boots and jeans.
DeSantis will join Laxalt and other conservatives and Nevada leaders at the 8th Annual Morning in Nevada PAC's Basque Fry on Saturday morning about an hour outside of Reno.
Other attendees at the Basque Fry will include Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo; pro-Second Amendment media personality Dana Loesch; and Steve Cortes, the national spokesperson of the biggest PAC backing DeSantis' presidential run, Never Back Down.
Nevada's presidential primary is scheduled for February 6, making it among the earliest states on the Republican schedule, as well as the newly revamped Democratic primary schedule.
The Basque Fry, a festival where fried lamb testicles are served among other foods, is considered a key event in the lead-up to the Silver State's primary.
Also known as 'lamb fries', the dish is a signature one in Europe's Basque culture, and the event, modeled after cookouts held by Laxalt's grandfather, former Nevada Governor Paul Laxalt, pays tribute to the family's Basque heritage.
The event typically draws thousands of conservatives, who come from around the state to have a ball.

"Haley Campaign Press Release - Opinion: As Blinken Visits China, What Would a 'Thaw' Look Like? Experts Weigh In",2023-06-16T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-opinion-blinken-visits-china-what-would-thaw-look-like,"
The Washington Post by Bates Gill, Nikki Haley, Zongyuan Zoe Liu, Michael Mazza, Andrew Browne, Christopher Wood, Emily de La Bruyère and Zongyuan Zoe Liu
Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to China this weekend to discuss the dire state of the relationship between Washington and Beijing. President Biden has said he wants to usher in a ""thaw"" in the two countries' relations, but the obstacles to détente remain huge. Competing security agendas are leading to confrontations at sea and in the air — including concerns about each side's intelligence-gathering efforts. China's brutal treatment of Uyghurs and Hong Kong democracy activists, as well as recent crackdowns on foreign investors, have left many members of the American political class deeply skeptical about the prospects for engagement. U.S. efforts to block Chinese access to sensitive technologies are angering Beijing. Indeed, relations have hit such a low that many informed observers doubt a thaw is even in the cards. We asked several experts to offer thoughts on how the two countries might defuse the tensions.
Last year, trade between the United States and China reached nearly $700 billion, a record high — a fact that undermines talk of a complete freeze in relations between the two countries. Moreover, both sides understand the downsides of fully pulling apart from one another.
The United States and the European Union have wisely discarded talk of ""decoupling"" from Beijing in favor of the term ""de-risking."" Even so, China and the West will continue efforts to limit each other's access to technologies, commodities and data deemed threatening to their national security interests.
Given those constraints, it makes sense for both sides to seek opportunities for cooperation in other realms. That could involve the promotion of joint research in tackling public health challenges such as cancer, finding common cause in mitigating climate change, jointly addressing development challenges in the Global South and reinvigorating people-to-people ties between the two countries.
Signaling a potential opening, the Biden administration says it would ""welcome"" China's role in contributing to a ""just and sustainable peace"" in Ukraine. And with Xi Jinping expected to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco in November, the possibility of a Biden-Xi summit will drive the two sides to seek constructive outcomes.
But as positive as these warming trends might be, the prospects for a thaw face a cold, hard fact: Geopolitically, the United States and China deeply distrust one another. That is unlikely to change soon. U.S.-China relations will remain solidly in the deep freeze for the foreseeable future. Anyone who wants to alter that would be well-advised to begin by focusing on chances for modest progress.
Nikki Haley: Five questions Blinken should ask when he's in China
Nikki Haley, a Republican candidate for president, was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2017 to 2019 and governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017.
The story of the Biden administration's approach to China has been weakness. The president has utterly failed in his dealings with China — militarily, economically and diplomatically. President Biden's treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, recently called for deepening our economic ties with China. That's insane.
China thinks the Blinken visit will be more of the same. It would be far better to show American strength and resolve. These are the questions that Antony Blinken should ask — and that Biden should've asked from the start.

Why is China preparing for war?

China's military buildup is breathtaking. It's building hypersonic weapons, nuclear missiles, cutting-edge warships and a host of other advanced technologies. Xi Jinping is dead-serious about winning a war. America should be just as serious and modernize our military. It's the only way to keep the peace.

Why is China abusing our economy?

The Chinese Communist Party exploits American companies to strengthen its own military — in ways that range from harvesting data to stealing sensitive technologies. This has to stop. Protecting our economy is a matter of ensuring our national security.

Why is China infiltrating America?

China has propaganda centers at our universities, police stations in our cities and farms near our military bases. Chinese companies are making the chemicals that wind up in fentanyl pills, killing Americans. It's time to protect our people from such dangerous intrusion.

Why is China infiltrating the Western Hemisphere?

It's not just the spy base in Cuba. Beijing is trying to turn almost every country in the Western Hemisphere against us, often using economic bribery. We need to get Chinese influence out of our backyard.

Why shouldn't the United States double down on supporting Taiwan?

Xi wants to destroy the island democracy. That would damage our economy and jeopardize our security. China should know that we'll help Taiwan protect itself because it's in our interest. For that matter, we need to tell China that we'll continue to help Ukraine beat Russia, in a preview of what will happen with Taiwan.
China doesn't want us to ask these questions. But it's time to hold our enemy accountable. Every day we don't puts America in greater danger.

Saying America is 'in a lot of trouble,' former Vice President Mike Pence publicly kicked off his 2024 presidential campaign in Ankeny Wednesday, officially beginning his bid against his former running mate, Donald Trump.
'I truly do believe in the boundless potential of every American to live the American dream. Traveling around this country over the past two years since I've left office, it feels different. Talking to our fellow Americans, I see a weariness on their faces everywhere I go, and I hear it in their voices,' Pence told a crowd of about 250 people at a Des Moines Area Community College venue in the Des Moines suburb. 'I don't have to tell any of you here: This country is in a lot of trouble.'
'We can defend our nation and secure our border, we can revive our economy, put our nation back on the path to a balanced federal budget. We can defend our liberties and give America a new beginning for life,' Pence said. 'But it will require new leadership — in the White House and the Republican Party.'

""If I could snap my fingers and magically make someone president, Mike Pence is the person I would put behind the Resolute Desk. He is one of the most decent and honorable people in U.S. politics. I never doubted that he would do the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021 — and I have no doubts that he would always do the right thing as commander in chief.
...
Pence is making defense of the Constitution the core of not just his critique of Trump but also his attack on President Biden and other Democrats. 'We've had enough of the Democrats and the radical left repeatedly trampling on our Constitution, threatening to pack the court to dismantle the God-given rights that are enshrined there,' Pence said on Wednesday. 'We must stand on the Constitution to protect the God-given right to life. We must stand on the Constitution to protect the right to keep and bear arms. We must stand for the Constitution to protect the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of our faith and conscience.'

Op-Ed by Mike Pence: Not Too Late for MLB,2023-06-15T00:00:00+00:00,Mike Pence,/documents/op-ed-mike-pence-not-too-late-for-mlb,"
by Mike Pence and Brian Burch
June 15, 2023
For almost 200 years, Americans of all political persuasions have united around the great game of baseball . Since 1909, congressional Democrats and Republicans have put aside their bitter divisions to compete together in the friendliest of rivalries. During the 2001 World Series, President George W. Bush rekindled the American spirit by throwing out the first pitch of game three in Yankee Stadium, just a month after one of our country's darkest days.But baseball's long, patriotic track record has come into question in recent years. In 2021, when my friend Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a law to protect election integrity in his state, Major League Baseball (MLB) chose to relocate the All-Star Game from Atlanta , citing concerns about ""voter suppression"" — a claim put to shame by the actual impact of the law, which produced historic voter turnout, including among African Americans.
In doing so, MLB not only undermined the game's apolitical reputation, but robbed the legacy of one of baseball's all-time greats, Hank Aaron. Atlanta hosted its first All-Star Game almost 50 years beforehand, a game in which ""Hammerin' Hank"" played and helped bring about an incredible victory. The 2021 game would have been a beautiful opportunity to honor the Atlanta Braves legend, who had died just months before.
Fast forward to 2023, when Major League Baseball's standing as our national pastime was desecrated by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an anti-Catholic hate group with a history of religious bigotry.
For reasons completely beyond understanding, the Los Angeles Dodgers decided to give an award to the ""Sisters,"" giving the group a public platform and spotlight for their indecency that risks sexualizing young children.For a moment, it looked like the Dodgers might reverse course, but sanity has not prevailed in Los Angeles. As Bishop Robert Barron has made clear, this kind of religious intolerance and public indecency would never be celebrated if it were targeted against another religious group like Jews or Muslims.In addition to the reputational damage MLB will undoubtedly suffer as a result of this grave error, the league should also consider the financial risk it is incurring. In recent weeks, Bud Light and Target have both endured a swift backlash after promoting the Left's radical gender ideology, with share prices dropping by double digits over the past month. Fed-up citizens are punishing woke companies for their ideological excesses.
Baseball once stood for American greatness, but when the MLB openly invites attacks on Christian faith, sexualizes children with graphic public displays, and undermines the family-friendly environment that baseball has long stood for, it is clear that those days are fading fast.
Still, while baseball has had a bad streak over the past few years, that does not mean the book is closed on the MLB. ""Pride Night,"" when the Dodgers will recognize the ""Sisters,"" is not until June 16. It is still not too late to reverse course and recover the reputation of American baseball.Baseball has long been cherished as America's pastime, transcending political, social, and cultural boundaries. We firmly believe that baseball still has the power to bring people together and foster a sense of American unity centered around our civic virtues. If the league acts quickly, we are hopeful that baseball can once again become a source of inspiration for millions of fans across these United States.
Mike Pence is the former vice president of the United States and a current presidential candidate. Brian Burch is president of Catholic Vote.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley's Iowa Leadership Team Boasts Republican Strategists and Local Politicians,2023-06-12T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haleys-iowa-leadership-team-boasts-republican,"
Des Moines Register by Noelle Alviz-Gransee and Francesca Block
Nikki Haley announced Sunday who will spearhead her campaign in Iowa. Her team, a mix of young Republican strategists and state politicians, is touting the South Carolina Governor and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations as a ""new generation"" ahead of the Iowa caucuses.
Haley is working to separate herself from an increasingly crowded Republican field.
Here's what you need to know.
Haley's work so far in IowaSo far, Haley has hosted or participated in 24 grassroots events in Iowa, according to her campaign team. These events have ranged from large town halls to intimate meet-and-greets. In April, she launched the Women For Nikki coalition in Des Moines.
Despite focusing on grassroots campaigning in early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, Haley is still trailing Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump. She's made frequent jabs at DeSantis, calling him ""Trump without the charm,"" though she doesn't often go after the former president by name. She did say it was a ""mistake"" that he chose not to attend Iowa Senator Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride in Des Moines the first week of June. When Trump called Jan. 6 a ""beautiful day,"" Haley also shot back by calling it a ""terrible day.""
Haley has positioned herself as the ""new generation,"" while framing her predecessors, including President Joe Biden, 80 and Trump, 76, as antiquated and out of date. Early in her campaign, Haley made headlines when she said politicians over 75 should be required to take ""mental competency tests,"" even suggesting at a town hall in Dubuque in late May that Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, 89, would take one ""in a heartbeat."" When asked at Ernst's Roast and Ride on June 3, Grassley told the Des Moines Register ""I rely on the voters of Iowa to decide who's competent in an election, not some psychiatrist.""
In her speeches, Haley emphasizes a litany of Republican issues, including cutting federal spending, reducing inflation, closing the southern border and opposing gun control. She also draws heavily on her foreign policy experience, referring to her time as U.N. ambassador and her track record confronting U.S. adversaries such as Russia and China on the world stage.
Haley said she would support whoever Republicans nominate for president, though she expects it to be herself.
""I don't play for second,"" she said during a CNN Town Hall hosted in Des Moines on June 4.
Who made it on Haley's team?Bill Mackey
Mackey will be Haley's Iowa Political Director. He was previously a campaign manager for Congressman Zach Nunn's winning campaign in IA-03. He plans on building a true grassroots leadership team and a network of supporters to light up phone lines and put in the groundwork.
""We're running our caucus operation the Iowa way,"" he said. ""Iowa is a word-of-mouth state and the way we are building out our team is reflective of that.""
Iowa State Senator Chris Cournoyer
Cournoyer, 49 of Scott County is a ""mom on a mission"" according to her campaign team. She is pushing to win her competitive district and advance Iowa values in the senate, which include school choice, economic growth and regulator stability for businesses and safe communities. Cournoyer said Haley is, ""a champion of the next generation and will renew our pride in America.""
During a May town hall hosted in Davenport, Cournoyer's district, the state senator introduced Haley as someone who can talk about more than what are typically considered ""women's issues"" like education and childcare. With her previous experience, she said Haley can talk foreign policy, strong militaries, protecting the border and keeping America first on the international stage.
Cournoyer also spoke in support of Senate File 482 in March which prohibits people from entering a school restroom or changing room that does not align with their sex at birth, according to previous reporting.
""We need to ensure that all students feel safe at our schools so they can focus on learning,"" said Cournoyer. ""We cannot sacrifice the rights and privacy of some students to accommodate the rights and privacy of others.""
Iowa State Rep. Austin Harris
Harris, from HD 49, Appanoose County boasts a midwestern work ethic, balancing his family and duties for constituents, according to her team. Harris believes Haley will be an ""exceptional president.""
""Nikki Haley is the woman in the arena and the next generation leader America needs. Republicans need a nominee who can win the general election and defeat Joe Biden. She will be an exceptional president,"" he said.
Dawn Roberts
Roberts is a former Polk GOP Chair and Iowa Secretary of State nominee. She was married to the late State Party Chairman Steve Roberts. She is impressed with Haley's foreign policy experience and her time as governor saying she provides the leadership required in the White House.
Emily Sukup-Schmitt
Sukup-Schmitt is a millennial business leader, mother and community leader, according to the release. Haley's Iowa team says her work at the family business Sukup Manufacturing is crucial to keeping Iowa agriculture's prominence.
""Millennials like myself want a bold leader who will build a strong and proud America for decades to come. That's Nikki,"" Sukup-Schmitt said. ""She's a fighter, a problem solver, and an outsider. She is the hardest-working candidate in this race, and anyone who underestimates her will be in for a big surprise.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Has America's – and Our Veterans' – Backs,2023-06-12T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-has-americas-and-our-veterans-backs,"
Townhall by Jason Church
My life changed forever on August 23, 2012. I was leading a platoon through the heart of Taliban country in Afghanistan. We walked into an ambush – and an improvised explosive device detonated right underneath me. Next thing I knew, my legs were severed.
By the grace of God, I survived. I've now dedicated my life to defending America outside the Armed Forces. We have to keep our country strong, secure, and prosperous, by defending the principles that have made us the greatest country on earth. Yet our own president – the current commander-in-chief – is weakening America at the worst possible time.
We have to retire Joe Biden and restore an America that's strong and proud. And we must elect the right leaders who believe in our country.
It's painfully clear that Joe Biden is the wrong kind of leader. He surrendered from Afghanistan in the worst possible way, throwing away two decades of sacrifice – including my own. Some of our best and bravest died because of his weakness. America is at more risk of a terrorist attack now than it was when Joe Biden was elected.
The president is tiptoeing around Communist China, too. America needs to stand up to Beijing and show that it can't walk all over us. That kind of strength is the only way to prevent a war that no one wants. By letting China get away with murder, Joe Biden is actually making war more likely.
Why isn't the president tackling these real and present threats? Because he's too busy directing our Armed Forces – the most powerful military in history – to learn about gender pronouns, fight racial grievances, and wage a war against climate change. Our enemies are getting stronger, but the Commander-in-Chief is making our military weaker by the minute. It's a national embarrassment. It has to stop.
The world is a dangerous place. It would be great if both Democrats and Republicans fielded presidential candidates who understand that fact, but in 2024, only the GOP will recognize reality. And while there are plenty of good candidates on the right side of the aisle, as a veteran and advocate for the Armed Forces, it is clear to me that one leader stands tallest, with a combination of proven executive leadership, foreign policy experience, and powerful patriotism.
That leader is Nikki Haley.
I've met Nikki, and I walked away even more impressed than I already was. She's the wife of a combat veteran from Afghanistan, like me. She knows the pride and fear that every military family faces. When Michael Haley was deployed to Iraq, she and her two children said their good-byes under the glare of TV cameras. She could have stopped him from going, since she was the sitting Governor. But she didn't. She knows how essential it is to defend our freedom.
Nikki's experience has made her a tireless advocate for veterans. As governor, she worked hard to make life easier for us, especially as we transition from the military to civilian life. She created programs to help veterans find jobs and cut taxes for military families.
Nikki's equally an advocate for those who serve in uniform today. As America's Ambassador to the United Nations, she defended our military as one of the greatest forces for good in the world. She supports giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, the support and investment they need to keep us safe, win any war, and most of all, preserve the peace.
Most importantly, Nikki is an advocate for America itself. As UN ambassador, she made sure America was respected again. Nikki told our enemies she was taking names, and she did, time and again. She had the backs of our friends and brought China and Russia to the negotiating table to pass the largest set of sanctions ever against North Korea. She looked evil in the eye and didn't blink.
We need this kind of principled leadership in the White House. And it helps that Nikki has proven executive experience. She faced multiple crises as governor with leadership, decisiveness, and compassion. Like a good commander-in-chief, she always put the people of her state first.
Nikki has made restoring national strength and pride a cornerstone of her campaign. She says she wants America to be ""strong and proud, not weak and woke."" She's right. And her personal story, as the daughter of Indian immigrants, proves the truth of her statement that America isn't a racist country. We're the greatest country in human history. Nikki knows we can be greater still.
At this very moment, the military can't meet its own recruiting goals, and America isn't fulfilling its rightful leadership. I served and sacrificed to preserve our freedom, not to watch our military be taken over by woke madness. I speak for millions of veterans when I say our country is better than this. That's why I want to see Nikki Haley become the President of the United States. If anyone can bring out the best in our country, it's her.

The DeSantis Family Joined the Stitt Family in Ponca City for Military Appreciation Night at 101 Wild West Rodeo
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey DeSantis, and their children, Madison (6), Mason (5), and Mamie DeSantis (3), joined Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and his family at the 101 Wild West Rodeo for Military Appreciation Night. Governor DeSantis received a warm welcome from the crowd as he delivered remarks.
""Hello, Oklahoma, it's great to be with you! Greetings from the Free State of Florida. We appreciate what you do here. I tell you in Florida we do a lot of the same things, we trust in God, we support our police, we support the military, we stand for Second Amendment rights, we stand for strong borders, and we know we need to make sure that that goes coast to coast in this country. And that's what we're gonna do,"" Governor DeSantis said. ""Freedom is one generation away from extinction, President Reagan told us, it's not passed along in the bloodstream. You need people who wear the uniform like we saw today to defend freedom, but we also need us as citizens to do our part. So that's what we're going to be doing over these next 18 months. Look forward to seeing you all over that and we will turn this country around. You mark my words. God bless everybody and thank you.""

Governor Stitt's endorsement comes on the heels of the endorsements of 20 Oklahoma state legislators and former NASA Administrator and U.S. Congressman Jim Bridenstine (OK-01), who was a member of the House Freedom Caucus.

Speaking before a large crowd of Oklahomans tonight, Governor Kevin Stitt (R-OK) endorsed Ron DeSantis for president.
""Governor DeSantis is a strong conservative and principled leader, and I am proud to endorse him for president,"" Governor Stitt said. *""As fellow Governors during COVID, DeSantis did not surrender states' rights and individual liberties over to groupthink. In this election cycle, Oklahomans will remember that DeSantis was one of the few who never backed down in the face of adversity, because DeSantis operated with dogged conviction and shared our values for a limited government and free country. *
Stitt continued: ""As a proven leader, DeSantis has boldly delivered results for the people of Florida that laid the groundwork for a booming economy, an education system focused on student outcomes, and better infrastructure for working families. To deliver these same results all across America and unwind the disastrous liberal mandates of the Biden administration is going to demand a candidate who can win and keep winning as a two-term president. I am confident that leader is Ron DeSantis.""
Stitt's endorsement comes on the heels of 20 Oklahoma state legislators and former NASA Administrator and U.S. Congressman Jim Bridenstine (OK-01), who was a member of the House Freedom Caucus and also endorsed Governor DeSantis earlier this week.

Ron DeSantis Statement on Reported Chinese Military Installation in Cuba,2023-06-08T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/ron-desantis-statement-reported-chinese-military-installation-cuba,"
Governor Ron DeSantis released the following statement in response to reports that China plans to establish an eavesdropping facility in Cuba:
""China is growing its worldwide influence because Joe Biden is weak.
Joe Biden and his administration's feckless foreign policy emboldens the CCP around the globe---seeking platitudes while Xi inks a deal for Chinese intelligence and military access in America's backyard. Biden's refusal to secure our border has allowed Chinese-produced fentanyl to kill our children. And recently, Biden allowed a Chinese spy balloon to fly over the United States with zero consequences for Beijing.
America's national interests are not advanced through performative diplomacy.""
BACKGROUND

DeSantis has noted that checking the growth and rise of China should be our first foreign policy priority.

o ""And I think overall, the number one issue that we face internationally is checking the growth and the rise of China."" (DeSantis Interview, Fox News, 3/22/23)


DeSantis wrote in ""The Courage to Be Free"" that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) covered up the existence and origins of COVID-19 and noted how U.S. dependency on China for critical needs during COVID was unacceptable. 


DeSantis has cracked down on the CCP as governor. 


o DeSantis in May of 2023 signed the strongest legislation in the nation to counteract the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. This legislation prevents Chinese entities from buying farmland in Florida, protects Florida's digital data from CCP spies, prohibits Chinese influence in higher education, and blocks access to TikTok on government and educational institution devices.
o DeSantis in September of 2022 ""announced executive action and legislative proposals to address threats posed by the CCP and other hostile foreign powers in cyberspace, real estate, and academia.""
o DeSantis in December of 2021 ""revoked all proxy voting authority that has been given to outside fund managers, to clarify the state's expectation that all fund managers should act solely in the financial interest of the state's funds, and to conduct a survey of all of the investments of the Florida Retirement System to determine how many assets the state has in Chinese companies.""

DeSantis took a strong stance against China while in Congress.

o In 2014, DeSantis cosponsored the Affirming the Importance of the Taiwan Relations Act. 
o In 2016, Desantis cosponsored a resolution expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People's Republic of China.
o In 2017, DeSantis cosponsored the Taiwan Travel Act. This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. government should encourage visits between U.S. and Taiwanese officials at all levels.

"Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Vows to Cut Biden's 'Disastrous' Energy Policies, Increase US Oil Production",2023-06-08T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-vows-cut-bidens-disastrous-energy-policies,"
Fox News by Haley Chi-Sing
GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley plans on cutting down President Biden's ""disastrous"" energy policies as well as bringing oil production back to the United States, if she is elected to the Oval Office in 2024.
Haley, who previously served as the governor of South Carolina, shared her energy plan with Fox News Digital ahead of her formal announcement in Texas on Thursday.
In her list of five main promises, Haley said she would work to ""empower American producers"" to boost oil production in the U.S. while fighting against the demonization of the oil and gas industry. She also said the government would have a more hands-off approach in energy production and spending while also ensuring the speedy permission and building of interstate pipelines.
The former ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration honed in on the Environmental Protection Agency and ""radical environmental groups,"" promising she would not allow them to halt any new energy projects on the horizon.
The GOP candidate also slammed Biden's green energy policies, saying she would ""roll back Biden's wasteful green energy subsidies and regulations."" Haley specified that a number of subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act could cost as much as $1.2 trillion along with a number of ""Biden administration rules and regulations that would hamstring our oil and gas industries,"" citing Biden's power plant regulations and his crackdown on gas-powered cars.
Finally, Haley said she would ""stand up to Russia and Iran"" in an effort to halt their energy imports and establish a strong foreign policy.
Biden and his administration have come under fire for his energy and oil policies since taking office, including canceling the Keystone XL pipeline during his first week, the overall increase in gas prices, and his environmental, social and corporate governance agenda.
The president's most recent energy crackdown comes as the administration is expected to finalize regulations that restrict which home gas-powered furnaces consumers are able to buy in the future. Some officials say the regulations would ultimately restrict consumer choice, drive prices higher and most likely have a low impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
Biden's decision to revoke the Keystone XL pipeline's permits in 2021, effectively shutting down the project, received much backlash from Republican lawmakers and energy industry representatives who argued it would have helped keep gas prices down and ensure energy security. However, a congressionally mandated report released in January says the Keystone XL project would have created between 16,149 and 59,000 jobs and would have had a positive economic impact of between $3.4 billion and $9.6 billion, citing various studies.
Likewise, the president has come under fire for touting low gas prices in the wake of record-high prices in 2022.
""Gas prices are down around $1.60 a gallon from their peak this summer – and my Administration will keep working to lower costs for American families,"" Biden tweeted in late January.
The White House has repeatedly put blame on the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine for high gas prices. Many rushed to Twitter at the time to call the president out on his hastiness to claim credit.
Most recently, the debt ceiling deal – titled the Fiscal Responsibility Act – included a provision to fast-track a 303-mile West Virginia-to-Virginia natural gas pipeline project for approval. The pipeline, which is 94% complete, is projected to create 2,500 construction jobs, $40 million in new tax revenue for West Virginia, $10 million in new tax revenue for Virginia and up to $250 million in royalties for West Virginia landowners.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley to Newsmax: 'Not Surprising' China to Build US Spy Base in Cuba,2023-06-08T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-newsmax-not-surprising-china-build-us-spy-base-cuba,"
NewsMax by Solange Reyner
No one should be surprised that China has reached a secret agreement with Cuba to establish an electronic eavesdropping facility on the island, GOP presidential candidate and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Newsmax.
""Look at what is happening. China has bought 400,000 acres of U.S. soil, most recently near Grand Forks Air Force base where our most sensitive drone technology is, we had a spy balloon go over South Carolina, not because we have pretty beaches, it's because they know we have a strong military operation there,"" Haley said Thursday during an appearance on Newsmax's ""National Report.""
""Look at the fact that President Xi said whoever owns the data rules the world and he's doing that by requiring all of our American tech companies that do business in China to cooperate with the Chinese military, so they now have surveillance over all our financial situation, our healthcare situation, our children's lifestyle situation.
""So, we shouldn't be surprised that they're now putting a spy station in Cuba. What we should be upset about is that [President Joe] Biden has done nothing about it, absolutely nothing.
""They've done nothing about what they did to us with COVID, they've done nothing about all the fentanyl coming across, we're letting China steal $600 billion of intellectual property from us every year and Biden continues to sit in the White House and do nothing.""
The facility in Cuba, roughly 100 miles from Florida, would allow Chinese intelligence to monitor electronic communications throughout the southeastern U.S. and ship traffic.
The report comes months after a Chinese spy balloon flew over the U.S.
""We have to let China know we're onto them,"" Haley said. ""We have to build up a strong military, we have to get energy independent, we have to hold them accountable for COVID, we've got to stop this purchase of U.S. soil.
""We need to get them out of our universities, and we need to make sure China knows, 'you make one more step of surveillance and we're going to sanction you.' And by the way, Cuba thinks that they're hurting from us now, we will make them hurt more.
""Biden has tried to loosen things on them and become more friendly with Cuba, [but] you don't become more friendly with a state sponsor of terrorism.""

CHARLESTON, South Carolina — The Asa for America campaign released the following statement today in regard to the indictment of former President Donald J. Trump. This statement can be attributed to Governor Asa Hutchinson:
""With the news that Donald Trump has been indicted for the second time, our country finds itself in a position that weakens our democracy. Donald Trump's actions—from his willful disregard for the Constitution to his disrespect for the rule of law—should not define our nation or the Republican Party. This is a sad day for our country. While Donald Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence, the ongoing criminal proceedings will be a major distraction. This reaffirms the need for Donald Trump to respect the office and end his campaign."" — Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the 46th Governor of Arkansas and a current Republican candidate for President

Haley Campaign Press Release - Exclusive: Nikki Haley Warns 2024 Candidates Are Actually Running Against 'President Kamala Harris',2023-06-07T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-exclusive-nikki-haley-warns-2024-candidates-are-actually,"
Breitbart by Ashley Oliver
DES MOINES, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley took a jab at President Joe Biden's competency level Saturday, saying candidates need to approach the 2024 race as if they were running against ""President Kamala Harris.""
""Anybody that thinks a vote for Biden is truly a vote for Biden is mistaken. You're voting for Kamala Harris,"" said Haley, former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the U.N., during an interview with Breitbart News at Iowa's annual Roast and Ride.
She added, ""That's what this is. We're running against President Kamala Harris. That's the way we need to look at it because that's what's going to happen if he gets reelected again.""
Haley's remarks came in response to a question about Biden's recent fall at a graduation ceremony at the U.S. Air Force Academy, the latest of multiple tumbles Biden, 80, has taken while serving as president.
""None of us should be proud of what we saw. None of us should celebrate the fact that he fell, but what's more important is, think about what China, Russia, and North Korea and Iran thought when they saw him. That's what I worry about. They sense weakness. And he just showed weakness,"" Haley said.
The South Carolina Republican also reiterated her calls for presidents, including Biden, to take a mental competency test.
""It's exactly why we have to have a new generational leader. We have to have term limits. We have to have mental competency tests for people over the age of 75,"" she said. ""We can't have these leaders that are making these big decisions not being at the top of [their] game.""
Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the race, is 76 and would therefore also be subject to a test under Haley's proposal.
Trump agreed with Haley in a statement on Truth Social in February, writing, ""ANYBODY running for the Office of President of the United States should agree to take a full & complete Mental Competency Test.""
Last month, dozens of House Republicans called on Biden to take a cognitive test in a letter to the White House.
Biden has passed two physical exams since taking office, but, as Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), a former Trump White House doctor who led the letter, wrote, ""There is no indication you have had any cognitive assessment, or if you have, such results were concealed from the public.""
First lady Jill Biden told CNN Haley's idea was ""ridiculous,"" touting her husband's lengthy international travels as evidence of his capabilities.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - In the News: Washington Examiner's Ryan King: DeSantis flashes youth and energy as he runs against Trump and Biden,2023-06-07T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-the-news-washington-examiners-ryan-king-desantis-flashes,"
The Washington Examiner today reported on how Governor Ron DeSantis ""has been playing up his 'energetic executive' pitch to voters"" and that ""if the Florida governor wins next year, he will become the third-youngest president in U.S. history and the first from Generation X."" Read the full story below.
DeSantis flashes youth and energy as he runs against Trump and BidenRyan KingJune 7, 2023Washington Examiner
Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has been playing up his ""energetic executive"" pitch to voters as he battles former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, who are nearly twice his age.
DeSantis's considerable age gap sets him apart from Biden and Trump in the 2024 race --- both of whom are nearly twice his age. If the Florida governor wins next year, he will become the third-youngest president in U.S. history and the first from Generation X.
""We tend to forget how young he is,"" historian David Pietrusza told the Washington Examiner. ""We've never had guys this old, like Biden and Trump. And Biden and Trump kind of fall into two different categories because Biden is noticeably not in great shape.""
Last week, concerns about Biden's age were highlighted after he tripped and fell on stage at an U.S. Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in Colorado. DeSantis was quick to seize on the stumble.
""Isn't it kind of just symbolic about the state of the country? You have a president who lacks energy, who's stumped, stumbling around. No leadership for the country's future,"" DeSantis said during a radio interview with Kelly Golden.
At 80, Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. He would be 82 during a second inauguration and 86 by the term's conclusion. Should Trump win, he would finish his term as the second oldest after Biden.
Numerous polls have pointed to concern among voters about Biden's age. For instance, an NBC poll released in April concluded that 70% of adults believed Biden shouldn't vie for another term, and 69% indicated that age was a factor. Thirty-two percent of respondents felt Biden had the mental sharpness needed to be president compared to 54% of those asked about Trump in a Washington Post-ABC News poll last month.
""If you were to look at Biden and Trump, we are essentially turning the clock back to 2000. If you look at sort of who the nominees were, Al Gore, born in 1948, George W. Bush born in 1946,"" GOP strategist Dennis Lennox, a DeSantis backer, said. ""Biden could essentially be the great grandfather of most 18-year-old voters,"" he added, referring to voters in the 2024 election.
Biden has called questions about his age ""totally legitimate"" and maintained that voters ""are going to judge whether or not I have it. His allies have fended off attacks about his age. His physician gave him a relatively clean bill of health, according to a summary released back in February.
Meanwhile, Trump has largely skated by questions about his septuagenarian status. His campaign shrugged off questions about whether DeSantis's comparative youth could be an asset by emphasizing Trump's commanding lead in virtually every major poll.
""President Trump is dominating in poll after poll, both statewide and national, because the American people know he is the only person who can win the White House in 2024,"" spokesman Steven Cheung said. ""The reality is only one candidate has built the greatest economy in American history.""
Only former Presidents Theodore Roosevelt at 42 and John F. Kennedy at 43 began their administrations younger than DeSantis would, should he win and start at age 46. Former President Bill Clinton is close, commencing his presidency at 46, but his birthday is a few weeks before the Florida governor, so DeSantis would be a little younger.
Targeting opponents' age hasn't always worked in elections. President Ronald Reagan, for instance, converted concerns about his age into an asset for his campaign with his famous quip that he was ""not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""
""Age is not something that can easily be hidden on the campaign trail. It's a very obvious aspect of a candidate's profile. But in many ways, it's a cheap shot if the candidates are delivering on their policies and their promises and they're able to carry out their duties,"" Northeastern University political science Chairman Costas Panagopoulos said.
Panagopoulos stressed that age is just one of many considerations voters take into account at the ballot box and noted that in a ""highly polarized political climate,"" it can be ""very difficult to nudge voters off of their choices.""
Moreover, some analysts warn that age-based attacks could come across as overly cut-throat and off-putting to voters.
""You don't want to look cruel. So maybe you leave that to surrogates. Or you just in your campaign ads and videos. ... You can do a Joe Biden lowlight reel and get your message across that way,"" Pietrusza said.
Some presidential aspirants have been blunter about Biden's age, such as 2024 hopeful Nikki Haley, who has called for mental competency tests for politicians over 75. Thus far, DeSantis's team and allied super PACs appear to have largely strayed away from direct digs at his rivals' ages.
""Republicans want a leader focused on the future --- someone with the energy and backbone to send Joe Biden back to his basement in Delaware. Gov. DeSantis has that in spades,"" Dave Vasquez, national press secretary for the DeSantis-aligned Never Back Down PAC, said.
Instead of harping on Trump's or Biden's ages, DeSantis has homed in on competency and pitched himself as a deeply engaged and in-command leader. This pitch seemingly doubles as a jab at Biden over his various mishaps and Trump, whom he has bashed for retaining Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic.
""We need an energetic executive. We need somebody that's going to get in there on day one and spit nails and really take Washington by storm,"" DeSantis added in the Kelly Golden Radio hit last week.
Beyond the attempts at casting himself as an energetic executive, DeSantis's youth and young family could help him connect with disillusioned voters, according to Lennox.
""He's got kids. He's basically our age,"" Lennox, who is in his 30s, added. ""My generation --- we're facing serious problems in this country. We can't afford to buy houses; many of us can't afford to get married and have children. ... He's very relatable for somebody in their late 30s and 40s who are facing those sorts of generational problems.""

Well, it feels like ESPN Game Day in here! Well, thank you.
Our hearts are full of gratitude for everyone who's made this moment possible, including all those that have gone before us and all of you that are joining us here today.
Thank you, Catherine. I'm so grateful for you. Grateful to be on this journey with you. I've witnessed firsthand how your brave and powerful decision to share your personal story of recovery has touched countless lives. And through your groundbreaking work on recovery you invented, you have literally saved lives. Catherine, I love you. Our state loves you and I know America is going to love North Dakota's amazing first lady.
Together, Catherine and I have so much gratitude for all the Burham and Helga's family members. We get our siblings, our cousins, second cousins, third cousins, nieces, nephews, even Aunt Joan Tua is here all the way from California. So we know we're going to get one vote in California. But all those close friends, all of you that are here today, looking back on the risers and I think that one third of my Arthur class of '16 is standing back there...high school. So thank you Glen Dave Gavin, everybody that's back there. But thanks to thanks to all of you that have encouraged us. You've supported us and you've believed in us throughout our lives. This is definitely a family decision and we're grateful.
Also today, we've got a whole boatload of elected officials here, fellow statewide state legislators, mayors, tribal chairs and tribal leaders from our five sovereign nations with whom we share geography, all of you that are elected today, you're in the arena and we're grateful for each of you for your service. Thank you.
But especially we want to thank today the people of North Dakota who we are so honored to serve. You took a chance on us in 2016 and that was another race where everybody said we're starting out as a long shot in a dark horse. So we think this is a good place to be. But I want to thank you all because reelecting us in that landslide in 2020 our 40 plus point victory margin was the largest in the country of any of the 11 governor races that year. You were the ones that all made that happen. Thank you. Thank you so much.
And again, thank you all for being here today that are watching here in the room and those in the overflow areas. But I want to thank you for being here. There are so many we know friends around the country that are watching online. Today is just the start of showing how much we can achieve when we all work together.
I grew up in Arthur, a tiny town of 300 people, part of the other 300 people that grew up, but our parents were a gift. They taught us not just by their words but by their actions. Dad, World War II Navy veteran, taught us the importance of service to country and the community. Mom. She taught us the importance of caring deeply, listening, thoughtfully, respecting everyone. And from the earliest days, dad and mom, not sure why, but they supported my entrepreneurship, my risk taking, whether it was crazy ideas like launching a newspaper when I was eight years old in elementary school or wilderness canoe trips or hitchhiking to Alaska as a teenager. But it was a cold Saturday night in January and we were ready to head out to play neighboring town, Kindred, when they pulled me off the bus to tell me that our dad was dying. I was a freshman in high school. That was tough.
But North Dakota is the kind of place where your neighbors rally around you. It was also interestingly the birthplace of the good Samaritan Society of America. At that time, we like to kind of brag that Arthur had a population of 400 not 300. We got to that big number because we probably counted the over 100 residents in the good Samaritan home. Good Sam. In those days, they took everyone in regardless of age or abilities. And so in a way our whole town was about taking care of each other, about helping those in need. About neighbor, helping neighbor. Every small town in America is like that, but Arthur, especially. If somebody was in need, a neighbor was always there to help out. We see that across the entire state of North Dakota today. If a farmer has a serious health issue, all the neighbors rally to get the crops planted or harvested. In every spring in North Dakota like this spring in ranch country, neighbors help neighbors with spring roundups and branding.
I'll never forget the way our town lifted up our family and supported us all, when mom had to go back to work after dad died. Other dads like Joe Peltier and my uncle Al Bergum, Lester Zimmerman all made sure I was doing ok. Mom was driving to and from Fargo for work and every night after basketball or football practice when mom was still working late in Fargo, I'd go to Helen Williams house for a fabulous dinner, homemade rolls and a wonderful chocolate milkshake. I'll always remember her generosity and kindness and her daughter Julie Barner is here today, Julie.
It shouldn't be a surprise that small town values have guided me my entire life. Small town values are at the core of America, and frankly big cities could use more ideas and more values from small towns right now. Along with cousins and friends, I worked every summer at our family's grain elevator, including some jobs like shoveling out rotten grain out of the pit. Those jobs should be featured on Discovery Channel's dirty jobs, actually. One time we were all so dirty, and we smelled so bad from that rotten grain, we went across the main street to go to the Arthur cafe and Walt Ann came out and said, ""No, no, we we'll serve you out here on the curb. You guys can't come in.""
I worked on the farm for Jack hog swathing grain. Every harvest all through high school and all through college and helped pay for college. I even worked as a chimney sweep. The minimum wage in North Dakota was $2.30, and I figured out that I could earn $40 an hour sweeping a chimney. I loved working outside. I loved climbing and I got to wear a top hat and tails when it was 20 below. And of course, this is a time when there was an energy crisis going on. OPEC had quadrupled oil prices and a lot of people were burning wood in their homes. So the threat of chimney fires was real. A clean chimney prevents those fires. So it was a chance to help people. And for me, the career had a real appeal because when you're a chimney sweep, you have an opportunity to move up fast and always stay in the black. Thanks for laughing, not groaning because I, for my kids, I had to have at least one dad joke in this presentation.
But I believe then, and I still believe now, and I believe it deeply, that unlimited opportunity exists everywhere in America. I literally bet the farm to help turn a small start up into a billion dollar company in North Dakota. People thought I was crazy. A software company in North Dakota? We ignored those and said North Dakota was too small, too cold and too distant to build a world class software company. We did it anyway. We built Great Plains Software into a company that served 140,000 businesses in 132 countries. And we did it with team members from more than 220 small towns across North Dakota. At the time we went public, we were one of the top five most successful NASDAQ IPOS ever. Only in America. Four and a half years later, by the time we joined force with Microsoft, we had just over 2,000 team members, 1200 of them based right here in Fargo, 400 team members across the rest of North America, and 400 Great Plains team members based around the globe. It's a tribute to the commitment of our partners and our team members and our investment and their absolute courage to take a stand against the conventional wisdom that said it just couldn't be done. Some people called us an amazing overnight success story. The truth is we were an overnight success story 18 years in the making.
When you start a software company here, you need to be willing to go against the grain and reimagine what's possible. And that's exactly what we did when we ran for governor in 2016. We shook things up a bit. We cut $1.7 billion in spending our first year in office. We cut red tape and streamline services. Working with other statewide elected and the legislature, we balanced the budget every year. We bolstered cyber security. We brought life back to our main streets. We made record investments in education, strengthened tribal relations, built infrastructure, unleashed energy production and diversified the economy.
North Dakota is both growing and getting younger. One of the only states that is doing that. And we have the third lowest unemployment in the country and the highest workforce participation in the nation. And again, working with the legislature this past year, we achieved historic pension reform, helped pterm limits, and enacted the biggest tax cut in state history. We know we can do the same for America.
Right now, the world, our economy, are both changing rapidly and how we respond will define our future. Technology is changing every job, every company in every industry, and this change will become more rapid than ever before. We need new leadership for the changing economy. We need a leader who understands the real work that Americans do every day. Someone who has worked alongside our farmers, our ranchers, and our small business owners. Someone who's held jobs where you shower at the end of the day, not at the beginning. Someone who's got decades of success selling our technology overseas and knows the threats and the risks to our future from foreign state sponsored competitors, stealing and pirating our intellectual property.
We need a leader who has experienced first hand that we win as a country when our innovators and entrepreneurs can soar and when every single person can grow and thrive. To unlock the best of America, we need a leader who's clearly focused on three things: economy, energy, and national security. And that, and that is why and that is why today I am officially announcing, I'm running for the President of the United States of America.
Thank you. That was so sweet, Mary. Thank you, uh godmother to our kids...I should point that out.
The economy needs to be the absolute top priority. Every small business owner and every family in our country is feeling the corrosive hidden tax on their lives driven by the Biden induced inflation. Inflation is the worst. It hurts those the most who can afford it the least. But innovation, that's always been the driver of America. Innovation over regulation, innovation over regulation. We say it every day in North Dakota. Innovation over regulation is how you solve the challenges we face today. Regulation looks backwards. Innovation looks towards the future.
The Biden administration is obsessed with creating mountains of federal red tape. These regulations raise costs for every American consumer. They hamper our ability to compete in the world marketplace. They siphon time and investment away from innovative solutions. And the way we retain our nation's position, which is so important to everything we do. Our position is the world's largest, most dynamic and most powerful economy, is through innovation. For well over a century, American innovation from telecommunications, to electric light, to flight itself. And the power of American agriculture, think of it feeding the entire world. America has led the way.
Yet when I was in high school, we were told two things were absolutely certain about our future. The world is going to run out of food and the world is going to run out of energy. However, today we live in a world of abundance because of American innovation. Innovation has paved the way for a better life for all Americans. And the potential, and the possibility that coming breakthroughs in software and biotech, energy and health care, can continue this trend. But due to over regulation that brighter future for Americans is now at risk. Let's get back to common sense. Let's eliminate red tape, get inflation under control, cut taxes, reduce the cost of living and help every American realize their fullest potential.
It takes energy to get things done in America. Clean, reliable, low cost energy brings manufacturing back to the US and reduces our supply chain risk. U.S. energy policy cannot not be separated from either our economy or from our national security. Energy policy directly underpins both and we need to stop buying energy from our enemies and start selling energy to our friends and allies. America produces energy cleaner and safer than anywhere else in the world. If you care about the global environment, you should be fighting to have every drop of energy produced in the United States. And when we're truly energy independent and we're supporting our allies, that's when we stabilize the globe and restore America as a leader of the free world.
Putin only dared to invade Ukraine because our allies in western Europe were all dependent on Russian energy. We need to recognize the real threats to America and strengthen our national security.
Growing up in a small town, you learn quickly. The enemy isn't each other. Our enemies aren't our neighbors down the street. Our enemies are countries that want to see our way of life destroyed. In a country built on neighbors helping neighbors, we become a country of neighbors fighting neighbors. We should all be fighting to unite the country against our common enemies like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and the drug cartels. And we all know Joe Biden isn't getting the job done and too often is making things worse. Gas prices are too high and the Biden administration enacts policies that make us more dependent on foreign oil. That makes no sense.
American families are struggling under the weight of record inflation and the response from Democrats: increase the size of the IRS to target Americans. That makes no sense. An out of control border that is ignored by the White House while killer drugs like fentanyl, infiltrate our communities. And 110,000 individual tragedies occur through overdoses. Think of that...110,000 families in 2022 lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, a sister or a brother...and were doing nothing about the border. That makes no sense.
We're facing a very real threat from China and Joe Biden's Green New Deal policies. They're only going to shift our dependence from OPEC to Sinopec. That makes no sense. We could go on for hours, but we don't need to. Where we come from when something isn't working, you stop and you try something new. That's common sense. Joe Biden has got to go.
If you want to ensure that Joe Biden is a one term president, I hope you're going to join our campaign by visiting dougburgum.com. And if you believe that the economy, energy, and national security are critical to our nation's future, remember, that's why I'm running for president. And if you want more small town common sense in Washington, in our big cities, we'll make that happen. And if you think that we need a governor and business leader who understands this changing economy, I want to earn your vote. Because this campaign, this election, is all about what it takes to bring out the best of America and improve every American life.
After my dad died, I saw first hand what it means to be the best of America when the people of Arthur North Dakota lifted up our family. When we built Great Plains software with team members from small towns across the nation, just like Arthur, it showed the best of America. The best of America exists. It exists in the smallest towns and in the biggest cities. The best of America is there on our farms, on our factory floors, and in tiny start ups with big dreams. Every day, students see the best of America when they're inspired by their teachers. We see it in our brave military, our dedicated police and our selfless first responders. It's there through the sleepless nights of new mothers and fathers loving their newborns and also in the loving caregivers who are taking care of those that are in the twilight of their life.
When we take the time to look, we can see that we are surrounded by the best of America. Working together, we will unlock the best of America in all of us. Please join us on this mission. With your support, we will improve every American life.
Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Exclusive: Nikki Haley Warns 2024 Candidates Are Actually Running Against 'President Kamala Harris',2023-06-07T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-exclusive-nikki-haley-warns-2024-candidates-are-actually,"
Breitbart by Ashley Oliver
DES MOINES, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley took a jab at President Joe Biden's competency level Saturday, saying candidates need to approach the 2024 race as if they were running against ""President Kamala Harris.""
""Anybody that thinks a vote for Biden is truly a vote for Biden is mistaken. You're voting for Kamala Harris,"" said Haley, former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the U.N., during an interview with Breitbart News at Iowa's annual Roast and Ride.
She added, ""That's what this is. We're running against President Kamala Harris. That's the way we need to look at it because that's what's going to happen if he gets reelected again.""
Haley's remarks came in response to a question about Biden's recent fall at a graduation ceremony at the U.S. Air Force Academy, the latest of multiple tumbles Biden, 80, has taken while serving as president.
""None of us should be proud of what we saw. None of us should celebrate the fact that he fell, but what's more important is, think about what China, Russia, and North Korea and Iran thought when they saw him. That's what I worry about. They sense weakness. And he just showed weakness,"" Haley said.
The South Carolina Republican also reiterated her calls for presidents, including Biden, to take a mental competency test.
""It's exactly why we have to have a new generational leader. We have to have term limits. We have to have mental competency tests for people over the age of 75,"" she said. ""We can't have these leaders that are making these big decisions not being at the top of [their] game.""
Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the race, is 76 and would therefore also be subject to a test under Haley's proposal.
Trump agreed with Haley in a statement on Truth Social in February, writing, ""ANYBODY running for the Office of President of the United States should agree to take a full & complete Mental Competency Test.""
Last month, dozens of House Republicans called on Biden to take a cognitive test in a letter to the White House.
Biden has passed two physical exams since taking office, but, as Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), a former Trump White House doctor who led the letter, wrote, ""There is no indication you have had any cognitive assessment, or if you have, such results were concealed from the public.""
First lady Jill Biden told CNN Haley's idea was ""ridiculous,"" touting her husband's lengthy international travels as evidence of his capabilities.

Dana Perino: Do you think you made a difference yesterday in trying to broaden the audience to get people to understand that you are Tim Scott, you are an individual, you happen to be conservative, you happen to be Black, but that is not what defines you?
Tim Scott: One of the things that we as conservatives have to do is we have to go where we're not invited. We have to spend time selling our message of conservatism to people who may be naturally inclined to say yes to our message, but they've never had a messenger show up. 
Dana Perino: So where might you go aside from ""The View?""
Tim Scott: I did a town hall this past Sunday in an African American church to have a conversation about why it is that we can believe in the future of this country – working together.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley CNN Town Hall: Six Key Takeaways from 2024 Hopeful's Iowa Event,2023-06-06T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-cnn-town-hall-six-key-takeaways-from-2024,"
Washington Examiner by Ryan King
Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley laid out a slew of conservative policy solutions during her CNN town hall event on Sunday.
Haley's town hall sharply contrasted her against her chief rival, former President Donald Trump, who partook in a CNN town hall last month, with her appearance being less combative than her former boss's as she staked out conservative positions on hot-button matters such as abortion, entitlement reform, guns, and more.
""Nikki Haley is the only presidential candidate talking to real voters on the ground and taking their questions in multiple town halls,"" Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik said. ""Nikki Haley won't cave to the liberal talking heads, and that's what voters love about her.""
Here are six key takeaways from the town hall event, which took place in Iowa.
Trump and DeSantis loom largeHaley's two main rivals in the GOP field, Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), cast a heavy shadow over the town hall. Haley has sought to chart her own path without dwelling on her rivals too much, but a few times during the town hall, Haley blasted them directly.
For instance, she bashed DeSantis for his battle with the Walt Disney Company, accusing him of being ""hypocritical"" for accepting donations from it and then suing the company.
""All this vendetta stuff? We've been down that road,"" Haley quipped at one point.
""Pick up the phone, deal with it,"" Haley argued. ""Settle it the way you should, and I just think he's being hypocritical.""
At one point, Haley condemned Trump's take on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot while underscoring the importance of having ""election integrity"" and rebuilding trust with voters.
""He thinks it was a beautiful day. I think it was a terrible day. I'll always stand by that,"" she said.
Calm and collectedHaley's demeanor attracted some attention from commentators during her town hall event. Unlike Trump or DeSantis, who have been known to get testy when grilled on certain matters, Haley remained evenly tempered throughout the night.
""One thing that really struck me was how folksy she was, how personable she was,"" CNN's Dana Bash said about Haley. ""There were a lot of points where she brought back that humanity, and that's no small thing.""
Haley began the event with an emphasis on the need to ditch the negativity in politics and usher in generational change.
AbortionThroughout the 2024 GOP primary cycle, abortion has emerged as something of an albatross matter. Haley has laid out her position on abortion numerous times and stuck to her principles while under scrutiny on it.
""What the media have done is they've made you demonize the situation when it's so personal that we have to humanize the situation,"" Haley said. ""Our goal should always be how do we save as many babies as we can and support as many mothers as we do it.""
She emphasized that she's anti-abortion and is keen on trying to find a national consensus on the matter. At one point, Haley dodged answering whether she would back a federal six-week abortion ban.
EntitlementsHaley did not shy away from entitlement reform despite some of her rivals, such as Trump, warning Republicans not to touch Social Security and Medicare.
""We can't keep kicking this can down the road,"" Haley argued at one point. ""And I know that Trump and DeSantis have both said we're not going to deal with entitlement reform — well, all you're doing is leaving it for the next president, and that's leaving a lot of Americans in trouble.""
Previously, Haley floated some proposals to prevent Social Security and Medicare from facing their projected bankruptcy, which includes lifting the retirement age for people in their 20s and engaging in means testing — paring down benefits for wealthy recipients.
Haley has also underscored the need to preserve benefits for those already retired and ensure that benefits will be available for the next generation.
""I think they're not being honest with the American people,"" Haley said when discussing some of her rivals' reluctance to take on the issue.
Foreign policyUnlike most of her peers in the 2024 arena, aside from Trump, Haley brings considerable foreign policy experience to the table. Her approach to world affairs also differed from some of her top rivals.
At one point, she implicitly rebuked Trump over his congratulating North Korean leader Kim Jong Un late last week for landing a role on the World Health Organization's executive board. Haley called the WHO a ""farce.""
""Congratulate our friends. Don't congratulate our enemies,"" Haley said.
On Ukraine, Haley contrasted herself with Trump and DeSantis, insisting that ""a win for Ukraine is a win for all of us."" Trump and DeSantis have equivocated about what the extent of U.S. support for the war-torn nation should be.
""This is bigger than Ukraine,"" Haley explained. ""This is a war about freedom, and it's one we have to win.""
GunsHaley opened up about her position on gun rights, revealing she is opposed to red flag laws, which create an avenue for law enforcement to confiscate guns from people believed to be at high risk of engaging in nefarious activity.
""I don't trust the government to deal with red flag laws. I don't trust that they won't take them away from people who rightfully deserve to have them,"" Haley contended. ""Because you've got someone else judging whether someone else should have a gun or not.""
She also emphasized the need to ""end gun-free zones,"" pinning blame on locations where guns are heavily restricted for shootings, because ""nobody else is going to be able to protect themselves.""
Haley's town hall comes on the heels of one Trump conducted with the network last month. Former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to announce his 2024 intentions this week and is slated to attend a town hall hosted by the network this Wednesday.
At the moment, Haley is polling in third place among the 2024 GOP field, per the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate.

NEW YORK CITY, NY –  This morning, Tim Scott joined ABC's 'The View' to respond to their ""dangerous, offensive, disgusting message"" about race and opportunity.

Watch here
Tim ScottThe ViewJune 5, 2023
Sunny Hostin: When it comes to racial inequality, it persists in five core aspects of life in the U.S., economics, education, healthcare, criminal justice, and housing. At nearly every turn, these achievements were fought, threatened, and erased most often by White violence. You have indicated that you don't believe in systemic racism. What is your definition of systemic racism? 
Tim Scott: One of the things that I think about, and one of the reasons why I'm on the show is because of the comments that were made, frankly, on this show, that the only way for a young African American kid to be successful in this country is to be the exception and not the rule. That is a dangerous, offensive, disgusting message to send to our young people today, that the only way to succeed is by being the exception. I will tell you that if my life is the exception, I can't imagine it is. So the fact of the matter is we've had an African-American president, African-American vice president. We've had two African-Americans to be secretaries of the state, in my home city, the police chief is an African-American who's now running for mayor. The head of the highway patrol for South Carolina is African American. In 1975 there was about 15% employment in the African American community and for the first time in the history of the country it is under 5%.
Here's what I'm gonna suggest... The fact of the matter is that progress in America is palpable. It can be measured in generations. I look back at the fact that my grandfather born in 1921 in Sally, South Carolina, when he was on a sidewalk, a white person was coming. He had to step off and not make eye contact. That man believed then what some doubt now: in the goodness of America. Because he believed that having faith in God, faith in himself, and faith in what the future could hold for his kids, would unleash opportunities in ways that you cannot imagine.
Every kid today can look – just change the stations and see how much progress has been made in this country. ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, ESPN, CNN, and Fox News, all have African-American and Hispanic hosts. So what I'm suggesting is that yesterday's exception is today's rule.The concept of America is that we are going to become a more perfect union. But in fact, the challenges that we faced 50 years ago and 60 years ago should not be the same challenges that we face today. And here's the way that you measure that. When my mother was born, about 10% of African Americans got a high school degree, diploma, today it is over 90%... One of the reasons why I took the funding for HBCUs to the highest level in the history of the country, and then I helped make it permanent is because I believe that education is the closest thing to magic in America. So I'm about making sure that our kids have as many opportunities to succeed as possible.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - In the News: Washington Examiner's Salena Zito: Don't Believe the Left's anti-DeSantis Narratives,2023-06-05T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-the-news-washington-examiners-salena-zito-dont-believe-the,"
The Washington Examiner's Salena Zito penned a column over the weekend exposing the corporate media's ridiculous smear campaign against Governor DeSantis and how little they understand the Republican Primary electorate.
Don't believe the Left's anti-DeSantis narrativesSalena ZitoWashington Examiner
Initially, much of the national press coverage of Gov. Ron DeSantis's (R-FL) presidential primary campaign rollout this week began with a fixation on proving whether or not he was likable to Republican primary voters.
The reason for that fixation is likely because many of them had spent the past six months writing stories about how the former Navy officer and congressman did not possess that attribute.
When that was disproved after several planned and unplanned retail stops, the fixation turned to his disdain for the press by not taking questions from them. Even after doing over a dozen interviews with local press and taking questions during a press conference, the narrative became: He doesn't take questions from voters.
In fact, the narrative hit a fever pitch on Thursday when a reporter from the Associated Press asked DeSantis, ""How come you're not taking questions from voters,"" at the very moment he was standing in a sea of voters who were clearly asking him questions and talking to him.
It was clear DeSantis was dumbfounded by the question, answering, ""People are coming up to me, talking to me. What are you talking about?""
DeSantis looked around at all the people he was just talking to and asked the reporter, ""Are you blind? OK, so people are coming up to me, talking to me whatever they want to talk to me about.""
Then things got silly real fast, at least on social media, as fellow New York- and Washington, D.C.-based reporters swooped in to comment on Twitter about how DeSantis ""snapped"" and ""lashed out"" at the reporter. Within hours stories were written in the legacy press detailing the ""confrontation.""
The moment made clear, once again, that the legacy media's approach to campaign coverage suits the people who they socialize and interact with on social media and is woefully disconnected from the people who actually vote in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.
Trust me, ask any voter who is standing in a sea of people talking to them why they aren't interacting with people, and most of them would ask you if you were blind. And they would never think that answer would mean they were snapping at you.
In short, when legacy media reports that DeSantis, or any other Republican candidate, isn't engaging or taking questions from voters when he is clearly standing in a field of voters and taking questions from them, people are not going to trust that you are getting the story right. Or worse, they are going to assume you are trying to create a storyline rather than follow a story.
There is a reason that the most recent Gallup polling shows a meager 34% of Americans trust the media to report the news ""fully, accurately and fairly.""
This year's Gallup survey marked the first time that the percentage of Americans with no trust at all in the media is higher than the percentage with a great deal or a fair amount of trust combined.
It is safe to assume that the narrative coming from the Washington, D.C., and New York reporters following the DeSantis kickoff will be: ""He doesn't talk to voters, he doesn't do town halls, he's angry and he hates the press."" It is a narrative that lacks perspective and patience.
DeSantis will do town halls, and Republican voters are simply not going to care about this ""confrontation"" with a reporter.
The perspective that is missing is that most of the reporters covering DeSantis in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina are not from Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina. And even if they originally hailed from those states, they've long shed that cultural connection and are now more socially and culturally connected to New York and Washington, D.C.
That does not make them bad people, but when your personal and professional life is spent in the counties that surround those two cities, counties that are the center of both wealth and power, your perspective and pace reflect those places and not the people in the place you are covering.
As for patience, well, sadly the current model for reporting is first, fast, scoopy, and clickable, none of the qualities that encourage patience in a reporter. That means we've got 522 more days of the gap between the press and readers outside of DC and New York only widening.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Aims to Require Members of Congress to Get Health Care From Veterans Affairs,2023-06-05T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-aims-require-members-congress-get-health-care,"
The Epoch Times by Jackson Richman
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says members of Congress should be required to get their health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), saying that would prompt lawmakers to fix a broken system.
""My way of fixing this is I think every member of Congress should have to get their health care from the VA,"" Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, said at a CNN town hall event in Iowa on June 4.
""I'm telling you, Jake, that would fix it right away because no one else would put up with what these veterans are having to put up with,"" she told moderator and CNN anchor Jake Tapper. ""And they deserve better than what they're getting.""
Haley lamented the state of the VA, citing that, on average, it takes veterans 29 days to get an appointment at the VA, which in turn reschedules with patients on the 29th day in order to reset the clock as, starting on the 30th day, veterans can go wherever they want to get health care.
Haley also criticized both the lack of telehealth to provide mental health services and addiction centers.
""The fact that we're treating our best in this way is a travesty,"" she said, referring to veterans.
Meanwhile, about 33,000 veterans are homeless, according to the VA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In addition, ""at some point in their life, 7 out of every 100 veterans (or 7 percent) will have PTSD,"" the VA says.
Also, as of 2020, an average of about 17 veterans take their own lives every day, according to the VA.
Haley says her husband, Michael, a major in the South Carolina Army National Guard, is set to deploy to Africa soon for a year.
""It's not our first rodeo. He did this when I was governor."" She joked that ""he seems to find really interesting times [to be deployed].""
""Deployments are never convenient,"" she added. ""But they're necessary.""
Haley said it's a blessing that the United States has military personnel to defend the country, and she offered a message to military spouses who are dealing with the deployment of their significant others.
""We can do this.""
The Haley town hall, which covered topics ranging from abortion to the Russia–Ukraine war, provided a contrast from the network's contentious town hall with former President Donald Trump last month.

HIGHLIGHTS
On ""Our Great American Comeback Tour"":
""It was incredible. We expected that we would get a good response, but in every place - Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina - the crowds exceeded our expectations. People were really excited to be out there and really appreciated the message... We papered all these places. We did five stops in Iowa, four in New Hampshire, and three in South Carolina. And I think what we showed is, Biden is not going to be able to get away with just sitting in his basement on this campaign, because we are going to run him ragged all across this country, holding him accountable for his failures.""
On Refusing to Bow Under Pressure:
""Somebody does a campaign contribution and you're supposed to lay down for them? That is not how I operate. People can support me or not support me. I call them as I see them, and if you have supported me but you're wrong, I am going to do what's right.""
On Why He is Running:
""I owe loyalty to the people that elected me. The people that elected me, they don't need to be loyal to elected officials. It's our job to be loyal to them, to their aspirations, and to the larger cause. Be loyal to your faith, and your family, and your country. Other politicians, you work with them to be able to advance a larger mission. But people need to earn it. You need to go out there and earn it. And I think what I would be able to do is, we would be able to get this done against Biden, but then come in with a lot of energy in the executive office, and have a really bold agenda that we will be able to implement, and then also run for reelection, get reelection, and then have 8 years to really institute lasting change. And I think that this is a critical moment for the country. We're not going to get a mulligan after 2024. You know, some people tell me like, oh, well, you should just quote wait to '28. Well, that would make sense if you're running to be somebody. But I'm not running to be somebody, I'm running to do something. And I think 2024 is the country's hour of need. And I think we'll be able to get the job done for the American people.""
On Why He is Being Attacked by the Media and Democrats:
""The corporate press is attacking me more than anybody else. The Democrats are attacking me. They would not do that if they didn't think I was a threat. I mean, if they thought that I was not in shape to really win this thing, they would just be ignoring me. But they are not. They are coming after me. I am the one that has taken most of the fire. And I think that is an indication that people know that we do have what it takes, and that we are a force to be reckoned with.""

*""We look to Iowa and Florida to see how it's done, and I think there are a lot of similarities in the success you have had under Governor Reynolds and the success we have had in Florida. Now we don't see that level of success throughout our country. We see the problems day after day, but I think American decline is a choice. And I'm running for president because I think if we choose another path, we can restore American greatness. That is the task before us."" *
On Bringing Energy to the Executive and Reversing Biden's Disastrous Economic Policies
""When I tell you I'm going to do something, I will do it. I do not just make idle promises so you think something is nice, and then get into office and forget. No, we set our sights on true north and we keep that compass there. So as president, I will be an energetic executive. I will go on offense. I will lean into all the issues that matter. We will reverse Biden's disastrous economic policies that are causing working people to lose ground and erode their standard of living. We are going to focus on small business, not big business. We are going to make sure we open up American energy production so we can be fully energy independent with our own resources here in the United States.""
On Slaying the Deep State
*""We have a responsibility to return this government to its rightful owners, we the American people. And in order to do that, we need to have a cadre of people who share our values and share our vision. Because you can't recycle people in from Washington, D.C, you uproot people from other parts of the country, send them on a mission to go to Washington, D.C and get to work holding this bureaucracy accountable. This bureaucracy has imposed its will on us for far too long, it is time we imposed our will on it."" *
On Ending the GOP's Culture of Losing
""There is no substitute for victory. And we need to dispense with the culture of losing that has beset the Republican Party in recent years. Iowa shows it can be done. Florida shows it can be done. We had red waves in 2022. The rest of the country? Not so much.""

Governor Asa Hutchinson's Statement on the RNC Debate Criteria,2023-06-02T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/governor-asa-hutchinsons-statement-the-rnc-debate-criteria,"
DES MOINES, Iowa — Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President as well as a former governor of Arkansas and official in President George W. Bush's administration, released the following statement in regard to the RNC's Republican Presidential Primary Debate Criteria:
""The RNC should have minimal criteria for the debates in the early stages of this campaign. More choices are better. I have always supported the party nominee, but I have never supported a party loyalty oath. The pledge should simply be that you will not run as a third party candidate. The 40,000 donor threshold will keep some candidates from being on the debate stage and benefits candidates who generate online donations through extreme rhetoric and scare tactics. It also deprives the voters in Iowa and other early states of an opportunity to evaluate the entire field of candidates. I do intend to be on the debate stage because it is important."" — Gov. Asa Hutchinson

Tim ScottFOX & FriendsJune 1, 2023
Tim Scott: The one thing we all should realize, and take a step back from the pundits who tell us that the progressive story of America is one that is filled with racism, it is a lie from the pit of hell, what we can believe is the story of evolution.
America is the one country on earth that fought the big fight so that we could all live together. I'm not talking about the civil war, I'm talking about the fight that happens every single day, where everyday Americans show up for each other. That is why my Faith in America tour reinforced my confidence that believing in each other is our best path forward.
Here is what we know about the Biden Administration, they weaponize race to hide their failures, to hide their insufficiencies. If you do that, you cheapen the journey of my grandfather. You cheapen the story of evolution, and you make young kids today believe the only way forward is to be an exception. But Today's rule was yesterday's exception, so all things are possible in America. And the best news is that the future of this country is not defined by the color of your skin, it is the quality of your education. We must continue push quality education in every zip code in this great nation.
Tim's op-ed on FOX News.com, America is the land of opportunity, not a land of oppression, outlines how Biden and the radical left's view of America continues to divide our nation.

DeSantis Campaign Press Release - All-American Swimmer and Women's Sports Advocate Riley Gaines Endorses DeSantis for President,2023-06-01T00:00:00+00:00,Ron DeSantis,/documents/desantis-campaign-press-release-all-american-swimmer-and-womens-sports-advocate-riley,"
Gaines will join DeSantis in South Carolina Friday to highlight his steadfast support for women's sports
During an interview tonight with Eric Bolling on Newsmax, All-American swimmer and women's sports advocate Riley Gaines endorsed Governor Ron DeSantis for president. Gaines will join Governor DeSantis on the campaign trail in Greenville, South Carolina Friday evening to highlight how she will work with the governor to defeat Joe Biden and stop the left's war on women's sports once and for all.  
""I'm so excited to announce that I am officially endorsing Governor DeSantis as president,"" Gaines said. ""His leadership has been crucial in rooting out the radical ideology that's really driving this insanity, and really bringing visibility to these cultural issues that affect the breakdown of families, the breakdown of faith, the breakdown of freedoms. He's really taken on this political establishment, the woke corporations, the media, and he's won. We know this based off his success in Florida alone.""
Watch Gaines' full interview HERE.
DeSantis in June of 2021 signed the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act."" The bill specifies that an athletic team or sport that is designated for females, women, or girls may not be open to students of the male sex, based on the student's biological sex listed on the student's official birth certificate at the time of birth. DeSantis in March of 2022 issued a proclamation declaring Florida-born Emma Weyant as the winner of the women's 500-yard (457-meter) freestyle at the NCAA women's tournament, rather than transgender athlete Lia Thomas.
ABOUT RILEY GAINES
Riley Gaines, a 12 time All-American swimmer with 5 SEC titles was a successful female swimmer at the University of Kentucky with ambitions to pursue a dental degree. That post-graduate ambition and her entire life was changed when she was forced to share a locker room and then compete against biological male Lia Thomas at the 2022 NCAA Women's Swimming Championship. This uneven challenge, not just for Riley but for every woman competing in the pool that day, was made even more traumatic when the NCAA officials insisted on giving Lia Thomas the trophy, despite tying Riley down to the hundredth of a second in the event. Riley can recall wondering why no one was standing up for her or for any women in the room. This moment became her call to action -- to defend and protect America's daughters against the woke left and their gender-denying ideology.

""Is it in our best interest as a nation to allow Joe Biden, someone we cannot trust on spending, to have an open checkbook? My answer is no.""
WASHINGTON D.C. –  This morning, Tim Scott told Axios he will vote no on the debt deal, noting ""we cannot trust [Biden] on spending.""
Watch here
Tim ScottAxiosMay 31, 2023
Tim Scott: The short answer is no. The long answer is when I think about what's in the deal, I find that two things are really important. Number one, that Kevin did a good job of figuring out how to negotiate with someone who did not wanna negotiate. The question I asked myself is at the end of the negotiation, is it in our best interest as a nation to allow Joe Biden, someone we cannot trust on spending, to have an open checkbook, no limit on the credit card until the end of his term? My answer is no. So the fact that the current deal allows for him to continue to spend however much he does with no limit is something that I can't support. Look backwards as well as forward. The one thing you'll see is last cycle, he had a $1.2 trillion deficit this fiscal year, a $2 trillion deficit. I can't imagine what we're looking at the next fiscal year if in fact there's no limit on the credit card.

This article originally appeared on WMUR.com.
Manchester, NH - Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson answered voter questions on spending and abortion rights Wednesday during a taping of ""Conversation with the Candidate.""
The Republican said he believes the GOP needs to move on from former President Donald Trump, making the case that a new conservative nominee can get the results without alienating certain voters.
""Passion is a conviction for your beliefs and a willingness to stand for them,"" Hutchinson said. ""I've been in the courtroom. I've fought for justice. I know how to fight. I know how to fight against the establishment. You can be a person of conviction and leadership and still have a smile on your face.""
Hutchinson said he wants to cut spending and reduce the number of federal employees.
""I came up with a great slogan for our campaign, and it's called 'Debt-free in '33.' Isn't that a great slogan?"" he said. ""And all the economists say it's impossible to meet that goal. So that's my heart. I'd love to address that debt, and the key is starting to address it.""
On abortion, Hutchinson said he's open to a limited ban but believes the issue will be the purview of the states for now.
""I certainly support reasonable restrictions on abortion but also reasonable exceptions: life of the mother and the cases of rape and incest, as well,"" he said.
Town hall participants said they're interested to see what Hutchinson can do in the first-in-the-nation primary.
""I always like governors,"" Ben Bolger, of Hanover, said. ""Governors have executive experience. You can see what they did in their own state. You can see if they transformed it for the better or worse.""
The complete ""Conversation with the Candidate"" can be seen at 7 p.m. Friday on WMUR. An extra half-hour will be available on the WMUR.com website and mobile app.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Letter: Small Business Owner Backs Former SC Governor Haley for President; Here's Why,2023-05-30T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-letter-small-business-owner-backs-former-sc-governor-haley,"
Greenville News by Marilyn Kendrick
As the owner of a small business, I want a president who will cut the red tape, gut regulations, and look out for the little guy.
I know Nikki Haley will do that as president because I watched her do it as governor. During her tenure, she turned South Carolina into the ""Beast of the Southeast"" and made our state an economic powerhouse. She brought big companies to South Carolina, creating thousands of jobs, while allowing small businesses to flourish.
As president, I am confident she will restore America's fiscal sanity.

The Democratic Party and its allies in the media, academia, Hollywood and corporate America are weaponizing race to divide our country and win political power. According to the radical left, racism is rampant in America and must be remedied by a progressive agenda that defunds our police, releases violent criminals without bail, and indoctrinates our children to believe their future is dictated by their skin color.
Instead of empowering minority kids to rise, these ""enlightened liberals"" are fighting to block school choice and eliminate honors courses in high schools because they believe in equity more than opportunity.
When the Biden liberals cynically play the race card, they cheapen my grandfather's journey. He was born in 1921 in the Jim Crow south and watched his family go from cotton to Congress in his lifetime.
When the radical left claims America is an evil, declining country, they cheapen my single mother's sacrifice. She worked 16-hour days as a nurse's aide to keep our lights on. Now the hands that changed bedpans hold the Bible when her son takes the oath of office.
The Biden liberals are so fixated on race and the pain of the past that they can't see the promise of America's future. The truth of my life disproves their lies and that's why I'm the conservative they fear the most.

Concord Monitor
Nikki Haley, this is a serious contender in the presidential race. The daughter of Indian immigrants, an accountant, a two-term governor of South Carolina, and ambassador to the United Nations where she took the ""kick me"" sign off the United States! While governor of South Carolina, they amassed an impressive list of accomplishments. She speaks her mind.
Although a member of the Trump administration, she openly told him when she disagreed with his actions. She is married to a combat veteran and her tenets are ""faith, family, and country."" This is the kind of person we need in the Oval Office. Someone ready to stand tall in the face of pressure, both foreign and domestic.

Governor Ron DeSantis joined Kayleigh McEnany, Joey Jones, and Todd Piro live on Fox & Friends this morning from U.S.S. Orleck in Jacksonville, Florida. During the interview, Governor DeSantis discussed his message to the American people on Memorial Day, the meeting he held with 9/11 Justice families yesterday, his faith, and how he will beat Joe Biden and lead our Great American Comeback. 
The interview came a day after Governor and First Lady Casey DeSantis hosted a Memorial Day BBQ in Tallahassee during which he held a private meeting with families who lost loves ones on September 11, 2001. Read the New York Post's exclusive coverage of the meeting HERE. Following the interview with Fox & Friends, Governor DeSantis delivered remarks at a Memorial Day ceremony in Jacksonville.
HIGHLIGHTS
On His Memorial Day Message:
""We have a great country built on great values. We have a great Constitution, a great Declaration of Independence, but those don't run on autopilot. If you don't have people throughout history, willing to put on the uniform, risk their lives and indeed give the last full measure of devotion, none of that is going to amount to very much. Today is a day to reflect on those that made the ultimate sacrifice, because if you don't have people that are willing to do that, then you really can't have a free society.""
On Meeting with 9/11 Family Members:
""They've had a lot of frustrations about getting justice based on the 9/11 attacks. They're  suing Saudi Arabia. They're trying to get more documents. They've been made promises in the past about getting help and then basically some of our elected leaders have reneged on those promises. I think that they've been punched in the gut a number of times, and I think it's been difficult to now be two decades later and still trying to get full justice. It's a very personal thing, some of the people in that meeting were teenagers, when their fathers died. There was a granddaughter who wasn't even born yet, and she's lived through the memories of her grandfather who died in the South Tower. Those are things that I think are still very raw, even a couple of decades later. Look, 9/11, I was down in Florida, I didn't have any connection in New York City, but it inspired me to join the Navy almost 20 years ago. It had a profound effect on our country. To see that right there, the raw emotions for people that were directly impacted, was very, very powerful, and it moved my wife and I very much.""
On the Power of Prayer and Casey DeSantis' Battle with Cancer:
""The amount of prayers that we received from people, not just in Florida but throughout the country, it made a huge difference. I saw her spirit be lifted up in ways that probably a lot of people did not think were possible. If anyone tells you to doubt the power of prayer, well, I'm an example here with me and my wife, where the power of prayer made a big difference.""
On Rejuvenating the morale in the Military:
""I remember being in Iraq, and we were in Fallujah, and it was not going well, and yet people were still willing to sign up knowing they get sent to Iraq because they believed that this was something special. I think we've lost that a little bit. I think we really need to rejuvenate the morale in the military. We will do that on day one, and you will see very big changes in the services.""
On Beating Joe Biden and Leading Our Great American Comeback:
""If I'm the nominee, I will beat Biden, and I will serve two terms, and I will be able to destroy leftism in this country, and leave woke ideology in the dustbin of history. At the end of the day, I've shown in Florida an ability to win huge swaths of voters that Republicans typically can't win while also delivering the boldest agenda anywhere in the country. And I think there is a reason why the legacy media is attacking me more than they're attacking anybody else, because I think they realize that if I'm successful in winning the Republican nomination, we are going to bring it home in the general election.""
On Winning Iowa:
""We are competing everywhere. Iowa is very important. We've gotten an incredible amount of support; I got endorsed by 37 legislators there before I even announced my candidacy. We obviously have a lot in common with Iowa in terms of what Florida has done and what they've done under Governor Kim Reynolds. And I think the groundswell of support has been really, really strong.""

Over 500 attended the event, including Gold Star families, veterans, and families who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001
Governor Ron DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis hosted Gold Star families, veterans, military families, and families who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001, in Tallahassee for a Memorial Day BBQ on Sunday evening. Over 500 attended the event.
Accompanied by First Lady Casey DeSantis and their three children, Madison, Mason, and Mamie, the governor spoke about the importance of honoring America's heroes and remembering their sacrifices.
""As a veteran--anybody that signs on that dotted line--you are effectively writing a check to this country for an amount up to and including your life. You don't know where they'll send you. You don't know what will come your way. But you make the commitment that you are going to put service above self, and you are ultimately going to sacrifice your personal safety in order to serve the greater good of our defense."" Governor DeSantis said.
""Not everybody--even close to everybody--actually has to pay the ultimate price. But some do, and from the very beginning of our country, those who have done that, we would not have been able to be a successful country without those sacrifices. They have been indispensable to the United States becoming what they are.""

""Freedom is fragile. Freedom is not something that can go on autopilot. It requires each generation to fight for it, and nobody has done that more than the veterans who have given the last full measure of devotion and service to this country.""
FULL TRANSCRIPT:
""We have a great country. Our country was founded on important ideals in the Declaration of Independence and later reflected in the Constitution, and those are very important. They made us different from countries that had come before. But at the end of the day, you can have the best Declaration that's ever been written, and you can have the best Constitution that's ever been written, but unless you have people throughout our history that are willing to put on a uniform and risk their lives, and, in some cases, give the last full measure of devotion and service to this country, then a lot of those principles are not going to amount to very much. It requires bravery; it requires courage from each generation.
As a veteran--anybody that signs on that dotted line--you are effectively writing a check to this country for an amount up to and including your life. You don't know where they'll send you. You don't know what will come your way. But you make the commitment that you are going to put service above self, and you are ultimately going to sacrifice your personal safety in order to serve the greater good of our defense.
Not everybody--even close to everybody--actually has to pay the ultimate price. But some do, and from the very beginning of our country, those who have done that, we would not have been able to be a successful country without those sacrifices. They have been indispensable to the United States becoming what they are.
We've got a lot of great people here today; we are going to meet with some of the families from 9/11. I'll tell you that is one of the reasons I joined the military after that. I know a lot of people did that. We lost thousands of very good people in the aftermath of 9/11 in our armed forces. Of course, we've lost tens of thousands in other conflicts like Vietnam and Korea, and many, many more than that, in World War II... and you go all the way back to the Civil War and the beginning.
These folks have made a difference. It's important that we commemorate that, because I think sometimes people think that this all just kind of happens and that you don't got to fight for it. I know when I was growing up, I kind of just assumed that, right? We live in a free country. Freedom is fragile. Freedom is not something that can go on autopilot. It requires each generation to fight for it, and nobody has done that more than the veterans who have given the last full measure of devotion and service to this country.
So thank you guys for coming here. As we do this celebration, then tomorrow, keep those heroes in top of mind because it's really on their shoulders that were able to be here today. I look at the problems in our country and what we have got to do going forward. Part of it i--I look at this one and that one--and we want to make sure they live in freedom, but I also look back at the people that have made those sacrifices. Don't we owe it to them to make sure we are doing all we can to keep this country the freest place on earth? I think we owe it to them, and it would not be doing them justice unless we did everything we could to make sure America comes back stronger than ever. Thank you, all. God bless you.""

""On every issue that the old guard of the Republican Party would have shied away from in a New York minute, I'm not only leaning into them, I'm winning against the media and against the left""
Governor Ron DeSantis joined Eric Bolling on Newsmax last night to discuss his presidential campaign announcement and vision for Our Great American Comeback. During the wide-ranging interview, DeSantis highlighted his record of accomplishments in Florida, and made the case as to why he's the best choice for Republicans in 2024.
Watch the full interview HERE.
HIGHLIGHTSGovernor DeSantis on winning:
""I wasn't exactly a pale pastel. I've been bold colors. I've stood strong for what we believe in, I never wilted under pressure. And yet people responded to that. So I think you want to have somebody who can draw people in, who may not have traditionally been Republicans, and are willing to give us a shot. I think a lot of people realize that Biden is a failure, but I think they're looking for a vehicle that they'll be comfortable getting behind. And I think I could coalesce a pretty good number of people to be able to do that. I do believe that there's a limit to the number of voters that would consider the former president at this point. I mean, we've seen it. You know, in Florida, we've seen in places like Georgia. I think that there are some people that don't like Biden, but they would like another option. So I think my ceiling is higher in a general election.""Governor DeSantis on the policy differences between him and President Trump:
""I think that some of the things he's been attacking me on, I've been a little surprised at because he's attacking me from the left. And that really wasn't that Donald Trump from 2015 and 2016. I mean, he was a hard charger, leaning in on all the issues, very edgy on conservative issues. And it was part of the reason he did so well. But when he's taken Disney's side against me, I just kind of wonder, like, okay, I get he wants to hit me, but don't take the side of a multinational corporation that wants to sexualize kids. He's also hitting me against voting against immigration amnesty. There was the Goodlatte to bill in 2018, and he said that that is akin to voting against the wall, but that bill was a 2 million person amnesty for illegal aliens, very little money for any border security. All conservatives opposed it. He did support it as president, which a lot of us were upset about. But to hit me for taking the America first position I just think is a little strange. So I'm not sure what his strategy is, but I think he's taking positions that are a little bit different than four or five years ago.""Governor DeSantis on the those falsely attacking him as an ""establishment Republican"":
*""How many establishment Republicans would have sent illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard? How many establishment Republicans would have stood up against Disney? How many establishment Republicans would have signed the bill that I just signed to ban land purchases from people affiliated with the CCP in the state of Florida? We're now being sued by the ACLU for that. How many establishment Republicans would have leaned in to support our children against the pronoun Olympics? We banned the pronoun Olympics in our schools -- we're the first state to do that. How many establishment Republicans would have banned gender transition surgeries for minors? We not only would take the doctor's medical license, we'll put the doctor in jail if they are mutilating minors. So on every issue that the old guard of the Republican Party would have shied away from in a New York minute, I'm not only leaning into them, I'm winning against the media and against the left. We say Florida is the place where woke goes to die because we've defeated the left on all these fronts. And my pledge if I'm elected president, after two terms, we will leave woke ideology in the dustbin of history."" *Governor DeSantis on the Politico hit piece on First Lady Casey DeSantis:
""These are people that are bottom of the barrel type folks. And all they're trying to do is character assassination. They use anonymous sources. They use people that don't even know Casey to try to smear her. But the reason they're doing it is because they know she's an incredibly strong woman. She's a wonderful wife and my best friend, great mother, but she's made a huge difference in the state of Florida. But the left and the media know, people love her. She's revered in this state. She is a potent political ally. When she's out in a place like Iowa with me, people rave about her. And so they fear her because they know that she's somebody that's very effective. So we both take it in stride, just in the sense that when you're over the target, that is when they're going to be shooting at you. And they're not going after other candidate's spouses because they don't view those spouses as a threat. And so she has taken it in good stride.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley is the Leader We Need to Fix Our Debt Crisis,2023-05-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-the-leader-we-need-fix-our-debt-crisis,"
Washington Examiner by Rep. Ralph Norman
Our country has a spending problem — a bipartisan one. For decades, Democrats and Republicans have run up the national tab without a care for who they might hurt. And as a result, American families are paying the price in the form of crippling inflation, and our children and grandchildren will have to pay it all back for decades to come.
Instead of getting their spending problem under control, our leaders are asking the bank for a larger limit. In a few weeks, Washington, D.C., will reach a once-unthinkable milestone, hitting the $31.4 trillion limit on the national debt. It's astounding that we've already spent more than $31 trillion. It's unbelievable that our leaders want to spend even more.
I believe that leader is Nikki Haley.
I served with Haley in the state legislature when we were both up-start state representatives. I saw firsthand her commitment to conservative principles, her fiscal responsibility, and, yes, her moxie. She took on both parties — including her own Republican leadership — and she never backed down. She correctly believed that taxpayers, not party politics, come first.
I saw her leadership time and time again. When Haley found out that South Carolina legislators almost never cast spending votes on the record, she immediately got to work. After all, off-the-record voting made it impossible for taxpayers to hold their politicians accountable.
Haley fought to change that. It didn't matter that she was a fairly new legislator low down on the totem pole. It didn't matter that Republican leadership punished her for standing her ground. All that mattered to her was doing the right thing.
She kept at it. Haley didn't make backroom deals. She didn't get bought off with the promise of more spending for her district and pet projects. Instead, she took her case to the people of South Carolina — and it worked. In one of her first moves as governor, Haley proudly signed legislation to put all spending votes on the record.
That's the difference between a leader and a politician. Leaders get things done. They solve problems. And more importantly, they tackle those problems — problems such as the debt ceiling — with the best interests of the American public at heart.
Haley showed the same principled leadership as ambassador to the United Nations.
Getting anything done at the U.N. was nearly impossible because it required Russia and China to sign on. For example, when Haley wanted to sanction North Korea, one of the world's most brutal regimes, people said it couldn't be done. Haley did it anyway. And when China tried to stonewall negotiations, she called Beijing's bluff. The U.N. ultimately passed the strongest set of sanctions against North Korea ever.
It only happened because of Nikki Haley.
If Haley could take on the South Carolina establishment, then she can take on Washington's entrenched elite as well. If Haley can get China and Russia to agree to hold North Korea accountable, then she can hold both parties' feet to the fire when it comes to the national debt.
We don't need a president who talks a big game about fiscal responsibility only to back down and give up when it really matters. We need a leader who stands up for taxpayers and stands up to Republicans and Democrats alike.
Nikki Haley is the leader I know who fits the bill.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Governor Ron DeSantis brought in $8.2 million in the first 24 hours following his campaign launch, shattering the record previously held by Joe Biden in 2019 ($6.3 million). The $8.2 million figure is a hard-dollar, direct-to-campaign figure.

""Governor DeSantis has built the strongest, most sophisticated organization in the history of American politics, and the tremendous support we've experienced in the last 24 hours will be critical as we hit the ground running in the early nominating states to share Governor DeSantis' plan to revitalize the American Spirit.""
This record hard-dollar haul will be critical in supporting Governor DeSantis' nationwide movement to lead the Republican Party into the future.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Exclusive: Nikki Haley Unveils Five-Point Plan to Assist America's Veterans,2023-05-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-exclusive-nikki-haley-unveils-five-point-plan-assist-americas,"
Breitbart by Nick Gilbertson
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has a five-point policy plan to assist United States veterans, including a vision to require members of Congress to obtain their healthcare through the Department of Veterans of Affairs (VA), Breitbart News has learned.
Haley's campaign exclusively shared her policy plan with Breitbart News ahead of a busy day on the New Hampshire campaign trail on Tuesday, where she will unveil her Veterans for Nikki Coalition.
""Hold the VA Accountable""Haley's vision for a mandate requiring members of Congress aims to bolster Congressional Oversight of the Veterans Health Administration and incentivize Congress to optimize it for the nation's veterans.
Currently, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management notes that House and Senate offices offer group health insurance plans to members and staff through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP).
Members of Congress and their staffers were eligible for Federal Employee Health Benefits until 2014 when an Affordable Care Act amendment established a requirement that members obtain coverage through employer-sponsored insurance or the exchange.
""Increase Access to Healthcare""Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also aims to ""increase access to healthcare"" for veterans, including allowing them to choose what hospital and which doctor they go to and tackling wait times.
Last year a JAMA study found that veterans waited an average of 29 days for primary care appointments at VHA medical centers, the Patient Engagement Hit reported. Wait times also averaged ""38.9 days for a primary appointment"" at community-based clinics.
Moreover, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation last year obtained documents that reportedly show the VA created an additional layer of review for veterans who are already eligible for community care, potentially prolonging wait times or denial of community care. This ""could lead to longer wait times or denial of community care,"" per the organization.
Additionally, Haley plans to increase access to Telehealth, which upwards of 2.2 million veterans used in the fiscal year 2022 under expanded access during the pandemic. Haley would make it so the expanded access is permanent if elected.
""Tackle Mental Healthcare""The third facet of her plan is to ""tackle mental healthcare."" The Wounded Warrior Project notes one in three veterans suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Thirty percent of veterans also have suicidal thoughts, according to a 2019 WWP survey reported by the Military Times.
Haley envisions having healthcare providers screen for mental health in the same way that physical health symptoms are looked for while giving them the freedom to choose their own providers. She also plans to speed up treatment for substance abuse, which advocates have testified takes months in some cases to access, as the Military Times reported in April.
""Support Veterans from Start to Finish""Another aspect of Haley's vision includes helping veterans with transitions into civilian life ""long after they leave the military."" This entails making veterans' benefits, such as tax credits, ""available to veterans' spouses"" and providing them options for using GI bill funds beyond education.
""Make Our Veterans Proud of Their Service""Finally, Haley seeks to make ""veterans proud of their service"" by eradicating ""wokeness"" and eliminating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives from the military. She also would continue investing in the military, ""so it is the strongest in the world.""
Haley has multiple immediate family members who have served. Her husband, Michael Haley, is a member of the South Carolina National Guard and a full-time federal military technician. In 2013, he deployed a combat zone in Afghanistan while she served as Palmetto's State executive.
Mitti Randhawa, Haley's brother, is also a veteran, having served as an army major with a deployment to Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.
As governor, she signed a law cutting taxes for veteran retirees, as the Associated Press noted at the time. Additionally, Haley signed an order that established a veterans policy advisory committee to understand veterans' needs an improve policy.

DeSantis Was Everywhere
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis officially announced his campaign for president tonight, and he did so in historic fashion. Governor DeSantis was everywhere.
The governor kicked off the evening by becoming the first-ever candidate to announce his campaign live on Twitter Spaces and broke the Internet in the process.
Governor DeSantis said during the Twitter Spaces conversation: ""If you nominate me, you can set your clock to January 20, 2025, at high noon, because on the west side of the US Capitol, I will be taking the oath of office as the 47th President of the United States, no excuses, I will get the job done.""
Listen to the full Twitter Spaces Discussion HERE.
In addition to the unprecedented virtual presidential announcement, the governor shared a video on Twitter in which he took aim at Joe Biden's failures and stressed how our Great American Comeback is attainable, but will take courageous leadership and a bold vision.
Watch the announcement video HERE.
Governor DeSantis then participated in his first interview of the campaign with Fox News Channel's Trey Gowdy.
Governor DeSantis said during the interview: ""You can call me whatever you want, just make sure you call me a winner because that's what we've done in the state of Florida --- and that's exactly what we would do nationally, not only in the election, but actually bringing all these great policies to bear.""
Watch a highlight from the interview HERE.
Next, Governor DeSantis called into the Mark Levin Show and highlighted his philosophy on leadership.
Governor DeSantis said during the interview: ""What I'm doing comes from a matter of principle and conviction. These are things that I believe. It's just part of who I am.""
Listen to the full interview HERE.
After that, the governor was joined by grassroots leaders from across the nation for a telephone town hall in which he answered questions about his vision for the country on key issues like reviving the economy, securing the border, and stopping the Left's woke agenda.
""We should choose a new direction, a path that will lead to American revitalization. We need to restore sanity to our nation, normalcy to our communities, and integrity to our institutions,"" **the governor said to listeners on the telephone town hall. **
**DeSantis capped off the night with a briefing call and Q&A with over 45 media outlets to speak about his priorities for the campaign and what to expect next. **
DeSantis told reporters on the call: ""When we work, we work very hard, we're not just going to show up once in a blue moon. We're going to paint every corner of these early states... We've got an incredible amount of enthusiasm.""

Tim Scott: I believe Sean, that the truth of my life, my experience coming from the wrong side of the tracks and seeing that opportunities available for every single one of us that is hard for them to swallow.
The truth of the matter is that their comments are offensive, they are dangerous and they're disgusting. Let me explain why, why are they dangerous? When you tell young African American kids that there's no chance to make it to the top unless you're the exception that is a lie from the pit of hell.
It's dangerous because kids today, they actually live down to the lowest level of expectations of their leaders. We need to tell kids the truth, that in America you can go as high as your character, your talent, and your grit will take you. If you want to live the American dream, work hard, put in the time, and all things are possible.
We are Americans, anything other than that is a lie. And here's why it is offensive to look around that new show. Two African American females, sitting on that stage, multi-millionaires, telling the rest of us that you can't make it in America unless you're the exception. I'm sorry. Yesterday's exception is today's rule. All things are possible. In today's America.

"Hutchinson Campaign Press Release - Presidential Candidate Asa Hutchinson Talks Economy, Security, Unity During South Carolina Stop",2023-05-23T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/hutchinson-campaign-press-release-presidential-candidate-asa-hutchinson-talks-economy,"
by: Skylar Laird, The Post and Courier
May 23, 2023
This article originally appeared on PostandCourier.com.
COLUMBIA, SC - Asa Hutchinson, the Republican former governor of Arkansas who's running for president in 2024, knows he has some stiff competition in South Carolina.
Hutchinson announced his run for the presidency April 26, joining a field that includes former South Carolina governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and, as of May 22, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.
""If I come in third to them, I know I'm in good hands,"" Hutchinson said during a lunch with the Richland County GOP on May 23.
Also in the mix is former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in early South Carolina polls.
Hutchinson's speech in Columbia focused on balancing the national budget, securing the border between the U.S. and Mexico, and bringing together a politically divided country.
As a potential default on the country's national debt creeps closer amid partisan discussions, Hutchinson called for Congress to once again balance the national budget — something he said hasn't happened in decades.
In one major change, Hutchinson wants to reduce the number of federal employees, excluding those working in defense, by 10 percent, streamlining services and cutting the amount spent on personnel. The plan is similar to one he implemented in Arkansas, in which he cut staff by 14 percent.
Hutchinson said he also wants to give states more control over who is eligible for Medicaid, allowing provisions like one Hutchinson suggested that would require recipients to work in some capacity to receive benefits.
""We need to loosen that up, give the states more flexibility,"" Hutchinson said. ""That will help control spending.""
Not on the chopping block were funds for federal law enforcement, particularly when it comes to the U.S. border with Mexico, as pandemic-era rules lapsed that had allowed many migrants to be turned away.
Once third-in-command in border security for the Department of Homeland Security, Hutchinson said the federal government needs to put more money into securing its border with Mexico, including erecting a wall and speeding up the process of deciding who gets to stay in the U.S.
""You've got to change the whole system,"" he said.
Hutchinson called on the federal government to generally strengthen its foreign security policies and up its involvement in Ukraine during Russia's invasion. On top of that, he said he would narrow the scope of work done by the Federal Bureau of Investigation — both stances that differ starkly from Trump's.
""Those who say we ought to defund the FBI or abolish the FBI, they're just demagoguing the issue,"" Hutchinson said.
To get these changes done, Hutchinson said, he would need to first unify political parties that have become increasingly polarized — a change he attributed at least in part to the popularity of social media.
That doesn't mean compromising his values, he said; instead, it involves building relationships across party lines.
For example, when protesters came out in Little Rock in force following the murder of George Floyd, Hutchinson said he mobilized state and federal troops to make arrests but also formed a task force of activists and police officers to propose policy changes.
""Today, we have leaders that capitalize on our division, and they push the division and they further divide us, and I don't believe that is presidential leadership,"" Hutchinson said.
The former governor, who served from 2015 to early 2023, pointed to his track record to underscore his points. When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, he kept businesses open despite the health risks, spearheaded tax cuts and signed a law making veterans' retirement pay exempt from income taxes, he said.
Hutchinson said his edge lies in his experience both as governor and in national government, where he worked in Congress and administration under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
The former governor also has a South Carolina connection: He got his bachelor's degree in accounting from Bob Jones University, an evangelical private college in Greenville, where he met his wife.
""All the candidates get to decide about South Carolina, but I think I have a home here, I think I can be competitive here, and we don't know what the future holds,"" Hutchinson said.
Members of the Richland County GOP, which represents a political minority in the state's second-largest county, said they were keeping an open mind.
""I'm holding out,"" said Deb Dollarhide, president of the Capital City Republican Women group. ""I'm listening to all of them and seeing how they respond to a lot of important issues, and then I'll make my decision.""

I rose from a child of poverty to a candidate for President of the United States because we chose patriotism over pity, and to be victors, not victims.  
Made in America – that's MY story.
That's why it pains my soul to see the Biden liberals attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. Indoctrination in our schools, Inflation in our economy, crime in our neighborhoods, victimhood in our culture. 
To the radical left that says we're an evil, declining country, I say the truth of MY life disproves YOUR lies. 
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because I have faith in America, and our president should too.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Bets on Retail Politics in Iowa,2023-05-23T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-bets-retail-politics-iowa,"
The Hill by Niall Stanage
It's Thursday lunchtime in Iowa and, upstairs in a boathouse on the banks of the Cedar River, Nikki Haley is making her case to be president.
The modestly sized venue is packed. The crowd is polite and receptive, and also notably upscale.
These aren't country club Republicans as such but they are clearly more prosperous than the MAGA battalions who make up former President Trump's base. At least two people in the question-and-answer session will talk about the tough challenges facing veterans.
Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, is fond of reminding skeptics that she has never lost an election. Watching her at close quarters, it's easy to see why.
The positions she enunciates are firmly conservative. She shows no reluctance to plunge into culture war issues, including immigration, ""wokeness"" in education, and support for law enforcement.
But Haley leavens the seriousness of her conservatism with a mix of charm and self-deprecation.
Her stump speech includes a memory of celebrating a victory over recalcitrant colleagues in South Carolina by ""blasting through the statehouse Pat Benatar's 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot.'""
Her remarks end with an instruction that, if the audience likes what they have heard, they should each tell 10 people. And if they don't, Haley adds with a theatrical flourish — ""Shhhhh!""
Afterwards, Haley waits to shake every hand, dispensing smiles and pleasantries all the way down the line.
One line in her remarks might be more politically important than any other, however.
""The polls you see today are not the polls you are going to see a year from now,"" Haley says.
She badly needs this prediction to be right. And she is betting that old-school campaigning here will make it so.
The boathouse event, held in Waterloo, brought her count of campaign events in the Hawkeye State to 20 since she announced her candidacy in mid-February. By the end of the following day — last Friday — the tally stood at 22.
When Haley tells Iowans that nobody will outwork her in the search for their vote, she seems like she means it.
Will it work?
A crowded 2024 GOP field
Haley faces major challenges — the most immediate being the possibility that she will get squeezed out by the two biggest names, former President Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).
In national polls, the contest right now is a two-horse race — even though DeSantis is only expected to make his official entrance into the race later this week.
In the weighted polling average maintained by FiveThirtyEight, Trump stood at about 54 percent support as of Monday afternoon, with DeSantis at about 21 percent. Haley registered just 4 percent support nationally.
Complicating the calculus for her even more, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) entered the presidential race on Monday.
It's a rarity to have two South Carolinians running for president and, if both stay in the race, they could make fundraising more arduous and, ultimately, damage each other's chances of a strong showing in the crucial Palmetto State primary next year.
But, despite those downsides, there are some reasons for optimism in the Haley camp.
Polling in Iowa is sparse at this stage of the race, but one of the few recent surveys showed Haley making progress. The poll, from Victory Insights, showed the former South Carolina governor in double figures, just 10 points behind DeSantis. They were both well behind Trump, but also well clear of the rest of the field.
The poll was also taken more than a month ago. At least as Team Haley sees it, there is plenty of time for her skill at retail politics to move the needle even more.
""We said we weren't going to do any shortcuts,"" Haley told The Hill in an exclusive interview before another campaign stop, in Dubuque. ""This is about touching as many hands as you can. This is about getting your message out. This is about getting people to trust you, and to earn their support. And so we will do town hall after town hall after town hall. We will stay until the last person is done.""
She insisted that, even in an age where candidates have innumerable options for connecting with voters, from cable news to Twitter and TikTok, putting in the miles from town to town can still break through.
""Even now, nothing takes the place of that eye-to-eye contact,"" she says. ""The shaking hands, the really getting to know people and them getting to know you — I just think that's more meaningful. It's easy to come in and do a rally and leave.""
Haley and Trump
The last remark could be seen as a jab at Trump, who can draw crowds but who generally feels no need to adopt the campaigning cadence that Haley has thrown herself into.
Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the early part of Trump's term, is trying to thread a fine needle when it comes to the former president.
At times, she seeks to make an asset of her service to him.
Her stump speech includes an anecdote about presenting the then-president with a briefing book showing the amount of foreign aid being given to nations that often voted against the U.S. at the United Nations. In Haley's telling, this produced a characteristically volcanic reaction from Trump.
But she also puts some clear water between herself and the former president.
At one campaign stop last week, in Ankeny, a woman in the audience asked Haley about the length of time some defendants are having to wait before their trials on alleged offenses related to Jan. 6, 2021.
Haley began her answer with language offering a break with Trump:
""I will continue to say it was a terrible day. It was not a beautiful day. It was a terrible day,"" she says.
In her interview with The Hill, asked why she believes voters want a ""new generation"" of leadership, as she often claims, she replies that Americans are ""tired of the drama. They're tired of the noise.""
As for DeSantis's likely entrance into the race?
""Welcome to the race. We've been waiting,"" a smiling Haley replied.
But the battlefield is getting more crowded now. The question of whether Haley can carve out her own territory is becoming more acute.
Will Haley's approach in Iowa benefit her?Iowa has produced plenty of upsets over the years, in both major parties.
The caucuses first became significant a generation ago when Jimmy Carter won the 1976 Democratic contest, a victory that ultimately catapulted him toward the nomination.
In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama won in Iowa on a night when Hillary Clinton was relegated to third place, changing that year's Democratic contest at a stroke.
On the Republican side, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee scored a startling victory in 2008 and, four years later, former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.) pulled off a broadly similar feat.
On the other hand, there are plenty of candidates of both parties who have virtually set up home in Iowa before the caucuses — and gone nowhere.
Which fate awaits Haley?
""The odds are against her — but lightning is going to strike somebody,"" said David Yepsen, who covered numerous caucuses during a 34-year stretch writing about politics for the Des Moines Register.
""Sure, it's possible that she does a Jimmy Carter, wins Iowa and goes the distance,"" Yepsen adds. ""But it is more likely that she carves a niche for herself in a post-Trump era…She will run well enough that by the time this is over, her position will be much enhanced in the national Republican Party.
""She is certainly young enough to fight another day if she doesn't make it — and she may make it.""
So far, there is at least some evidence that Haley's bid to turn Iowa in her favor, one potential caucus-goer at time, can't be wholly ruled out.
After the event in Ankeny, Des Moines resident James Hart tells The Hill that he is impressed:
""Very articulate, well spoken, I think she's got a good head on her shoulders,"" he says. ""In Iowa we like to look somebody in the eye and see what kind of character they have. That's real value.""
In Waterloo, retired educator Beth McCrindle and her attorney husband Kevin McCrindle also seem close to being won over.
""I was in tears about five different times…I think I maybe have found my candidate here,"" Beth tells The Hill. ""But I will continue to go and hear the others as they come through too.""
No-one is speaking of Haley as a winner yet. For all the warm words, she still runs the risk of being unable to escape the long shadows of Trump and DeSantis.
But ask her about the charge, too often leveled at female candidates, that she's really running to be vice president, and an emphatic reply comes back.
""I don't play for second; I've never played for second. I'm doing this to win it,"" she says.

"Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in North Charleston, South Carolina",2023-05-22T00:00:00+00:00,Tim Scott,/documents/remarks-announcing-candidacy-for-president-north-charleston-south-carolina,"
[As prepared for delivery.]
I am so happy to be back home in North Charleston.
I am so proud to be an American, aren't you?
We live in the land where it is possible… for a kid raised in poverty by a single mother in a small apartment… to one day serve in the People's House… and maybe even the White House.
This is the greatest country on God's green Earth.
***
Today, I think back to my grandfather. A man born in 1921 in Salley, South Carolina; in the Deep South.
By the time he was in the third grade, his education was over. He was forced out of school and had to start picking cotton.
But he lived long enough to watch his grandson pick out a seat in Congress. That's the evolution of the country we live in!
My family went from cotton to Congress in his lifetime. And it was possible because my grandfather had stubborn faith.
He had faith in God… faith in himself… and faith in what America would be.
He looked beyond the pain of his present and saw the promise of the future.
This Black man who struggled through the Jim Crow South believed then what some doubt now: In the goodness of America.
I was seven years old when my parents divorced. We moved in with my grandparents. My mother, my brother and I shared one bedroom in a 700-square-foot rental house.
But my grandfather said: 'Son — you can be bitter, or you can be better. But you can't be both.'
He chose patriotism over pity. He focused on the windshield of life, not the rear-view mirror.
And today, I am living proof that America is the land of opportunity, not a land of oppression.
This isn't just my story. It's all of our stories.
The circumstances may be different, the details may change, but every one of us is here because of an American journey where there were obstacles… that became opportunities.
Pain… that revealed purpose.
If you believe it, say 'Amen'!
But under President Biden, our nation is retreating away from patriotism and faith.
The fewest people in 30 years believe kids today will have better lives than their parents.
And the radical left is pushing us into a culture of grievance instead of a culture of greatness.
***
My momma worked 16-hour days as a nurse's aide — changing bedpans and rolling patients.
It was hard work. It was not glamorous.
But those 16-hour days put food on our table. And kept our lights on. They empowered her to move her boys out of a place filled with anger into a home full of love.
My mom's work ethic taught me there is dignity in all work.
It's why I know if you are able-bodied, you work! Period.
My momma said we could be victims or victors — and she chose victorious.
But under President Biden, our nation is retreating away from work and dignity.
Millions and millions of people have dropped out of the workforce entirely.
And the share of working-age men choosing to work is the lowest it has ever been.
***
Now, while my mom was working 16-hour days, I was busy feeling sorry for myself.
My mom was too busy. My father was absent. We didn't have money for little treats.
I felt disillusioned and angry. I was a challenged young man who felt the weight of life accumulating on my shoulders.
But when I was about 15, I met John Moniz, a Chick-Fil-A operator.
John came into my life when I really needed a mentor. He started teaching me important life principles.
John showed me that having a job was good, but creating jobs would be even better.
He explained that having an income would determine my lifestyle, but creating a profit could change my community.
John taught me that anyone, from anywhere, at any time can succeed beyond their wildest imagination.
But first, I had to take responsibility for myself. He told me in the most loving way possible to look in the mirror and blame myself.
Don't blame my mom who was working long hours. Don't blame my dad who wasn't there.
Because if I saw the problem in the mirror, then I could also see the promise.
I chose personal responsibility over resentment. I became the master of my fate.
But today, the Biden Administration has us retreating away from earned success, aspiration, and accountability.
He wants to make waitresses and mechanics pay the student loans of doctors and lawyers who make six figures.
This Administration has taxed, borrowed, and spent trillions of dollars trying to replace a hand up with handouts. All they bought us was crushing inflation that has devastated families like mine.
***
Like many poor families, we moved around. I'd been to four different elementary schools by the fourth grade.
My freshman year of high school, I almost failed out. I failed four subjects: English, Spanish, world geography, and civics.
For anyone who doesn't know, civics is the study of politics. God has a sense of humor.
And after 10 years in the Senate, I know I'm not the only person in Washington D.C. who's failed civics!
So that's where I found my unhappy self.
My momma was a tireless encourager — still is. But when she saw those grades, she provided me a very different form of Southern encouragement!
I was thoroughly encouraged from about here, all the way to here.
I went to summer school. I caught up on classes. And I never failed another subject the rest of my life.
I started college on a small football scholarship at a Christian school.
That's where I learned that Jesus was my life and football was just a game.
I found my true hope in the words of Ephesians 3:20 — in 'Him who is able to do exceedingly, abundantly, beyond all that we ask or imagine.'
And I graduated with my degree in Poli Sci right here from Charleston Southern University. Go Bucs!
I have lived the truth that education is the closest thing to magic in America.
But today, the far left has us retreating away from excellence in our schools.
Extreme liberals are letting Big Labor bosses trap millions of kids in failing schools.
They're replacing education with indoctrination.
They spent COVID locking students out of the classroom, and now they're locking kids out of their futures.
And in Biden's America, crime is on the rise and law enforcement is in retreat. The far left is ending cash bail. They're demonizing, demoralizing, and de-funding the police.
I grew up in neighborhoods alongside people who ended up incarcerated or in a cemetery. We needed more public safety, not less!
We cannot have innocent people at risk, police officers getting attacked and ambushed, and seniors locked in their homes in fear from sundown until sunup.
***
Joe Biden and the radical left are attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb.
And that is why I am announcing today that I am running for President of the United States of America!
They're attacking our American values; our schools; our economy; our security.
But not on my watch!
I cannot stand by while this is done to America. She has done too much for me.
Our nation, our values, and our people are strong. But our President is weak.
America is not a nation in decline. But under Joe Biden, we have become a nation in retreat.
Retreating from our heritage and our history.
Retreating from personal responsibility and hard work.
Retreating from strength and security.
Even retreating from religious liberty and the worship of God himself.
They say opportunity in America is a myth and faith in America is a fraud.
But the truth of my life disproves their lies!
We are not in decline. We are in a Biden retreat.
So all we need to do is turn around.
***
On my first day as Commander-in-Chief, the strongest nation on Earth will stop retreating from our own southern border.
If you don't control your back door, it's not your house. And if our southern border is unsafe and insecure, it's not our country.
Hundreds of people on the terrorist watch list are crossing our borders.
Chinese nationals are flooding into Mexico to break in.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are doing nothing while 70,000-plus Americans lose their lives to fentanyl. Every county in this nation is a border county.
The Left shut down your schools and churches in the name of slowing down a virus. But they won't secure the border to protect your family from fentanyl.
When I am President, the drug cartels using Chinese labs and Mexican factories to kill Americans will cease to exist.
I will freeze their assets. I'll build the wall. And I will let the world's greatest military fight these terrorists — because that's exactly what they are.
***
Security needs to start on our borders. But it doesn't end there.
We have spent decades getting deeper and deeper in debt to the Chinese Communist Party.
Their goal is not just to surpass us. It is to beat us.
Proverbs 22:7 says 'the borrower is slave to the lender.'
It goes beyond just finances, though.
It's about our supply chains. It's about medicines, microchips, and critical minerals.
It's about China buying American farmland, infiltrating our airspace, and tracking our kids.
It's about President Xi siding with Putin and Iran.
America can win this competition. But Joe Biden can't.
As President, I will rebuild a military so lethal and powerful that our adversaries will fear us and our allies will respect us.
My father — who is here with us today — and my brothers have 85 years of combined military service between them. When I am President, our servicemembers will have every tool they need, and our veterans will have every resource they deserve.
We will not try to be the world's police force. But we will always defend our vital national interests and our people.
And we will win the next century by the strength of our economy. China started this new economic Cold War, but America will finish it.
I was a lead author of the Republican tax reform that slashed taxes for families, brought jobs and investment back from overseas, and created Opportunity Zones to inject private dollars into communities that have been left behind. We created high employment, low inflation, and fast wage growth for the working class.
That was one bill. Imagine what we'll do with an entire agenda.
I will be the President who ramps up research and development, reclaims supply chains, and re-energizes our manufacturing base with Opportunity Zones 2.0 and an entire Made In America agenda.
I see an era of exponential innovation, where America leads the world with new breakthroughs.
Where new medical cures and cheaper drugs are lowering healthcare costs and lengthening our lives.
Where law enforcement has advanced equipment that makes them safer.
Where we have huge, new American factories, creating high-paying American jobs, running on plentiful and cheap American energy.
***
But America cannot be safe or secure if we sink into cultural quicksand here at home.
As President, I will rebuild and restore every rung of the ladder that helped me climb.
Because I want my American story to pale in comparison to yours.
As President I will motivate, inspire, and require every able-bodied citizen to take responsibility and go to work.
We will back the blue, secure our streets, and finally make it a federal crime to kill, ambush, or assault a cop in this country.
I will lead a revolution for excellence in our schools. Less C.R.T. and more A-B-Cs. I will not rest until every family has a choice, and every parent has a voice, and every child has a chance. And no child is forced to attend a failing school simply because they live in the wrong ZIP code.
And I will be the President who destroys the liberal lie that our country is evil.
Two years ago I spoke to the nation and said America is not a racist country.
We need to stop canceling our Founding Fathers and start celebrating them.
Finally — my grandfather's stubborn faith was not just faith in the goodness of our nation. It was faith in the goodness of our God Himself.
I will be the President who stops the far left's assault on our religious liberty. I will preserve one nation, Under God, indivisible — where we honor our Creator and respect every innocent life.
***
This is who we are! This is what our nation can be!
This is the freest and fairest land. Where you and I can go as high as our character, our grit, and our talent will take us.
I bear witness to that. I testify to that.
That's why I'm the candidate the far left fears the most.
When I cut your taxes, they called me a prop.
When I re-funded the police, they called me a token.
When I pushed back on President Biden, they even called me the N-word.
I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control. The truth of my life disproves their lies!
I will proclaim these truths from the highest mountaintop and I will do so from the deepest valley.
I will take our message to the boardroom and I will take it to the classroom.
I will take it to a gymnasium filled with friends and the inner-city church surrounded by skeptics.
I have lived the American dream. I have held the truth, the inalienable truth, that all men and women are created equal! And endowed by our Creator with the right to be free!
Our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing.
Victimhood or victory?
Grievance or greatness?
I choose freedom and hope and opportunity.
Will you choose it with me? Will you join me as a messenger of hope, a missionary that the power of our ideas can change our nation again?
I will! God bless these United States of America.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - First on Fox: Haley to Launch Veterans for Nikki Coalition During NH Stop Next Week,2023-05-18T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-first-fox-haley-launch-veterans-for-nikki-coalition-during-nh,"
Fox News by Paul Steinhauser
EXCLUSIVE: Republican presidential candidate and former governor and ambassador Nikki Haley will unveil her Veterans for Nikki coalition next week during a two-day swing through New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary and second overall contest in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.
And Haley, the only female candidate among the major contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, will also launch a Women for Nikki New Hampshire coalition. The announcements, shared first with Fox News on Thursday, will come as the former two-term South Carolina governor who later served as ambassador to the United Nations makes her fourth swing through the Granite State since declaring her candidacy for the White House in February.
Serving as the honorary chair of Veterans for Nikki is someone that Haley knows quite well – her husband Michael – who's a member of the South Carolina National Guard and a full-time federal military technician. He joined the National Guard following 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, and in 2013, he became the first spouse of a sitting governor to serve in a combat zone when he deployed to Afghanistan.
""When my National Guard unit deployed to Afghanistan while Nikki was governor, I had no doubt that our family and our state would be in strong, capable hands,"" Michael Haley said in a statement. ""Nikki is fearless and has always had the backs of our veterans and armed forces. As commander-in-chief, she will lead with grit and resolve.""
Jason Church, a retired U.S. Army captain who lost both of his legs in an IED explosion during his first deployment to Afghanistan, will also serve as part of the veterans coalition leadership team. ""A President Nikki Haley will face America's national security threats with backbone and courage,"" he emphasized.
Haley will announce her veterans coalition next Wednesday, May 24, during a campaign event at VFW Post 1631 in Concord, New Hampshire. Headlining the event will be retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc, a New Hampshire native who spent four decades in the military and served ten tours of duty in Afghanistan. Haley made multiple trips to New Hampshire last autumn to support Bolduc as he made his second straight bid for the Senate. Bolduc endorsed Haley after she launched her 2024 presidential campaign and has introduced her at numerous New Hampshire events.
Bolduc noted that as South Carolina governor, Haley ""signed multiple bills to help our veterans and make the transition to civilian life easier. The bottom line is, Nikki Haley will be a commander-in-chief we can be proud of.""
Ahead of her veterans coalition launch next Wednesday, Haley will unveil her Women for Nikki New Hampshire coalition. She announced a similar coalition earlier this year in Iowa, the state whose caucuses lead off the GOP nominating calendar.
While in New Hampshire next week, Haley will also headline the latest installment of the politics and eggs speaking series at Saint Anselm College's New Hampshire Institute of Politics, which has been a must stop for White House hopefuls for over two decades. And she'll headline a No BS Backyard BBQ in Rye, New Hampshire that's hosted by former Sen. Scott Brown and his wife, former congressional candidate Gail Huff Brown.

"Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - The Jerusalem Embassy, Five Years Later",2023-05-15T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-the-jerusalem-embassy-five-years-later,"
Jewish News Syndicate by Nikki Haley
On May 14, 2018, something incredible happened.
The United States finally opened our embassy in Jerusalem, 23 years after we first promised to do so.
This was an important moment for Israel. But it was just as important for America. It showed that we keep our word, stand with our allies and put our own interests and principles ahead of the world's demands.
The day was a long time coming. In 1995, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which pledged to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This should not have been a controversial move. Jerusalem is Israel's capital. America had located its embassy in the capital city of every other country, just not Israel.
But Republicans and Democrats alike ignored the Act. Even though it was passed by an overwhelming margin, three straight presidents declined to implement it. They were warned that the sky would fall if we moved our embassy. So, the leaders of the free world gave into fear and cowardice.
Even in 2017, it was not a foregone conclusion that America would fulfill its decades-old promise. Many of my colleagues in the Trump administration were strongly opposed to the idea. They warned that our allies would turn against us, Americans would be killed and war in the Middle East would quickly ignite.
Some of us knew better. Twenty-two years of the status quo hadn't curbed Palestinian terrorism or brought the two sides closer to a peace agreement. Our unwillingness to act only made America look weak. A country that can't fulfill a simple decades-old promise to an ally is a country no one respects. Everyone walks all over it.
Moving our embassy was ultimately about standing up for ourselves. No one—not the U.N., not our friends and certainly not our enemies—has the right to tell the United States where to put our embassy. After Donald Trump finally made the decision to implement the Act, I proudly vetoed a U.N. resolution criticizing the U.S. for doing so. I was the lone veto out of the 15-member Security Council. It was the first U.S. veto at the U.N. in nearly seven years.
In my speech following the veto, I explained, ""Jerusalem has been the political, cultural and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people for thousands of years"" and that America was acknowledging the obvious.
Just as importantly, I stood up to the critics, defended American sovereignty, and took the names of those who attacked us. As I warned, ""The United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation. … This vote will be remembered.""
For too long, America acted like an international doormat. We worried more about upsetting enemies than defending friends. We looked the other way when evil regimes committed unspeakable crimes. We convinced ourselves that playing nice would make the worst countries in the world play nice too.
They did not. All we did was embarrass ourselves.
Five years later, the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem is a proud symbol of American strength and the strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship. It is also a reminder of how America can and must ignore the bullies and do what's right—not least because it puts the bullies in their place.
How things have changed. Under President Joe Biden, America has gone into retreat. From the surrender in Afghanistan to the failure to deter Russia from invading Ukraine to putting partisan politics ahead of allies like Israel, Biden is listening to the same foolish ideas—often from the same foolish people—that I heard over and over before we moved the embassy to Jerusalem. They say that weakness is really strength, that inaction is really leadership.
It wasn't then. It isn't now. More than ever before, the United States needs to send the message that our friends can trust us, our enemies should fear us and we'll do what's right no matter who stands in the way. That is the lesson of moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. It's a lesson we need to remember, and then remind the world of it.

"Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Blames Biden for Creating Migrant Crisis as Title 42 to Expire, Pushes Plan to Secure Border",2023-05-12T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-blames-biden-for-creating-migrant-crisis-title-42,"
Fox News by Adam Shaw
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is blaming President Biden for the ongoing migrant crisis at the southern border as border officials prepare for the ending of the Title 42 public health order this week — with Haley promoting her plan to secure the border if she were to become president.
""Never forget that Joe Biden created this crisis. He urged migrants to 'surge' the border,"" she said, referring to remarks Biden made as a presidential primary candidate.
Haley then noted Biden's reversal of Trump-era policies such as the Remain-in-Mexico policy and border wall construction — which Republicans have argued were working to bring down apprehensions.
""He caved to the radical wing of his party and reversed polices that were working. Now, Biden has turned every state in America into a border state,"" she said. ""The first step to securing the border is to vote Joe Biden out. My plan calls for implementing a national E-Verify program, defunding sanctuary cities, stopping handouts to illegal immigrants, and firing Biden's new IRS agents and hiring 25,000 new Border Patrol and ICE agents.""
Haley became the first announced 2024 candidate to visit the border last month, where she made a number of stops in Texas. She also used that trip to roll out her plan for the border, which includes the mandate for E-Verify. Haley had previously backed the program when she signed legislation as governor of South Carolina to require all businesses to use the immigration status verification tool.
""We did a mandatory E-Verify program that said none of our businesses could hire anyone that was in this country illegally,"" she said on ""One Nation with Brian Kilmeade."" ""That is what got them out of South Carolina because there were no jobs for them to come to, that's what will get them out of this country, we've got to make sure none of our businesses hire anyone that is here in the country illegally, and we've got to start taking this seriously. Every state is a border state.""
Her plan would also restore the ""Remain-in-Mexico"" policy — which kept migrants in Mexico while their immigration hearings proceeded, instead of releasing them into the U.S. Republicans have credited that policy with reducing the pull factors which drew migrants north.
Additionally, she has said she would cut funding to states that have been used to give money to illegal immigrants — such as the billions used by New York to cut checks to illegal immigrant workers who lost their jobs during the pandemic.
Haley's remarks come as Title 42 — which has allowed for the rapid expulsion of migrants at the southern border due to the COVID-19 pandemic — is set to expire on Thursday along with the COVID-19 national emergency.
Migrants are already flooding to the border, and numbers are expected only to surge in the coming days when the order ends as migrants believe they are more likely to be released into the U.S.
The Biden administration has been warning people not to make the journey, and has taken a number of actions, including cooperation with Mexico on deportations and an increase of penalties for illegal entry — but so far it does not seem to be dissuading migrants.

CHARLESTON, S.C. – Presidential candidate Nikki Haley released the following statement on the allegations against President Biden and his family's financial ties to China and Romania:
""If true, the allegations about the Biden family's financial ties to China and other countries raise serious questions about corruption and why the Department of Justice never acted on this information. Joe Biden must be transparent with the American people about what he knew, when he knew it, and every penny his family received from foreign countries.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Backs Congressional Term Limits Plan,2023-05-09T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-backs-congressional-term-limits-plan,"
Washington Examiner by Ryan King
Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley endorsed a congressional term limit plan.
Under the plan, politicians would be limited to three House terms and two Senate terms. She is the first 2024 candidate to sign a pledge to back the plan and support a constitutional amendment for it, according to U.S. Term Limits, a group that advocates that policy.
""Our Founding Fathers did not want people to make careers out of government. Yet our current D.C. politicians have made a lucrative career of long-term service with some members of Congress serving most of their life in Congress. The result of this dysfunction speaks for itself,"" Haley said in a statement.
Many conservatives have come out in favor of term limits, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who introduced a U.S. Term Limits-backed constitutional amendment in the Senate. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has also committed to holding a vote on it in the House, per the group.
""We are pleased that Ambassador Haley has signed the U.S. Term Limits presidential pledge,"" Philip Blumel, the president of U.S. Term Limits, said in a statement. ""These advocates have rejected the career politician model and want to replace it with citizen leadership. The way to achieve this goal is through congressional term limits.""
In order to go into effect, the proposal would need to attain a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress and get ratified by at least 38 states.
Haley previously garnered attention after she pitched mental competency tests for politicians older than 75. In backing her proposal, she took direct aim at President Joe Biden, 80, and has raised doubts about his ability to finish a second term in office.

"Commencement Address at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia",2023-05-06T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/commencement-address-regent-university-virginia-beach-virginia,"
[As prepared for delivery.]
It's an honor to address the Regent University Class of 2023.
Congratulations on the end of this journey – and the start of one that's even better!
This is an important day in your life. We're all so proud of you. And you should be proud to get this far. It's a great achievement.
The classes are done. The tests are over. The grades are in – and you cleared the bar.
Now all you have to do is sit through one… last… lecture.
Well, I have some good news.
They gave me 45 minutes for my address…
But I'm going to take 12 minutes – tops. It's my graduation gift to you!
I know what's going through your head right now. I've been where you are – waiting to get your degree and get started with the rest of your life.
I also know you're barely paying attention.
I get it. TikTok is much more interesting.
But I think you should be aware of something…
As President, I'm going to ban TikTok.
Oh, now I have your attention.
It's okay that you're distracted. You should be. At least a little.
You're probably thinking about God's goodness in getting you this far. You're thinking about His call in your life, and where He takes you from here.
Maybe you're daydreaming about the job you're about to start. Or maybe your mind's on where you're about to move.
The future is on your mind. But before you get going, I want to bring you back into the present, and even remind you of your past.
That starts with your time in this special place.
You've received an extraordinary education.
Where other schools just fill your heads with facts, at best, this school devoted just as much time to filling your heart with faith.
In these halls, you didn't just prepare for your career; you prepared to answer your calling, in every facet of your life.
You've trained to be leaders in the truest sense – people who will summon our society to follow the truth.
And so, before I continue, please join me in thanking the faculty and staff who formed you to be Christian leaders who will change the world!
And I want to give a special thank you to the man who's at the heart of Regent University.
None of us would be here without Dr. Pat Robertson. That includes me. I'm thankful for his invitation to address you today.
The truth is, few leaders have done more to enact the Biblical commandment to train up the next generations in the way they should go. Even fewer have done so much to keep America on the straight and narrow.
Dr. Robertson, I speak for everyone here when I say… thank you for your faithful service to this institution and our nation!
Finally, I want all of you to think of the people who shaped you before you got here – the ones who shared everything they had to get you this far.
I'm talking, of course, about your parents and loved ones.
You may think this day is meaningful for you, and it is. But believe me when I say it's even more meaningful for them.
My husband Michael and I are blessed to be the parents of two beautiful children. Our daughter, Rena, graduated from college in 2021, and our son, Nalin, is in college right now.
I know from experience that your families' hearts are bursting with pride. There won't be very many dry eyes in this crowd before the day is out. That emotion is beautiful. It springs from the deepest kind of love.
Your families are looking at you right now, so I want you to look back at them. Please get on your feet, turn around, and show your families how thankful you are for their sacrifice and selfless love every step of the way!
From the moment you were born to the moment you arrived at this ceremony, you've learned the things that matter most.
I'm not talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic. I'm talking family, freedom, and most of all, faith. They are the building blocks of a life well lived.
They're also the essential foundation of America. We need these values to survive if we want our country to thrive. And we're counting on you to stand for what's right.
A commencement speech is supposed to leave you with life lessons. I believe this is the most important lesson I can convey.
Your generation is the most important in American history. What you do will decide whether our country slides downward, toward division and loss of purpose, or moves upward, together, in pursuit of our timeless promise.
Graduates of Regent University, I am asking you to believe in America. It's the only way to make America better. And I am confident that, together, we can bring out the best of America.
Now, I'm an optimistic person – always have been, always will be. My faith and my life have taught me there's no barrier we can't break and no wrong we can't right.
That's as true today as it ever was. In many respects, the challenges we face as a society have never been greater. But our capacity to overcome them is greater still.
Remember that as you leave Regent University and enter the real world. You're going to find that things are, well, crazy out there. The challenges facing our country are even bigger than you know.
We've reached a point in American history when common sense has gone out the window.
Think about it. We live in a time when men are playing women's sports. We're told it's progress. Believe me – it's not.
We live in a time when unborn babies are denied the most basic right there is – the right to life. We're told it's wrong to save them. We're told it's wrong to support their moms. But that's exactly what we should do.
Worst of all, as America prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the very core of our country is being whittled away. Today, in the greatest nation in human history, we're told that America is actually evil – that our history is racist and our principles rotten.
Now, when I was at the U.N., I heard plenty of countries attack America. It's their favorite pastime, and it usually comes from dictators, murderers, and thugs.
They found out quick that I wear heels, but not as a fashion statement… I wear 'em for kicking.
I expected to hear criticism of America at the U.N. But I never imagined I would hear it from so many of my fellow Americans.
Patriotism and pride are disappearing. A self-destructive self-loathing is spreading fast.
Now, you won't find this crisis at Regent University. Thank God for that.
But you do see it in lots of places. Your friends at other schools have been hit over the head with lies about America. A lot of them held to the truth, but too many probably didn't.
My son is a junior in college. He's having to write papers he doesn't agree with – just to get an A.
That's wrong. But what's so much worse is what our youngest children are hearing in the classroom.
Think of a five-year-old, at the start of kindergarten. If she's white, she's told she's bad, and she always will be. If she's brown or black, she's told she'll never be good enough – that she'll always be a victim.
I can't imagine what would have happened if I'd been told I was a victim when I was five. It might have put me on a different path. A path of anger and resentment, not optimism and faith.
That's what we're doing to a whole generation. Ninety percent of students today are being taught to hate America. They should be taught the truth about America – that this is the greatest nation in the history of the world. And they should be set on a path to help America achieve our full promise.
Our country deserves our love and hard work. It always has, and it always will.
Which brings me back to you, the Class of 2023.
These are far from the only challenges facing our country. There are many more. Some are close to home. Some are on the other side of the world. But all of them affect you. And they can all be overcome.
Your faith should give you that hope. Your belief in God should always inspire your belief in America. It does for me. And it's kept me going all these years.
I don't know where you'll find yourself this time next month, much less 5 or 10 years down the road. But I do know that wherever you go, and whatever you do, you can use your voice for good.
Some of you will be in graduate school. It will likely be different than your experience here. It might be less friendly to your values. But stand strong. Don't give in or give up on what you know is true.
Some of you will start your first post-college job. That'll be different from Regent, too. You might feel pressure to abandon your beliefs. But stand up for yourself. Stand up for what's right.
If each of you does this, you'll be amazed at what happens – and where God takes you.
You'll rise to the top of your field, giving you an incredible opportunity to change minds, win hearts, and move our country in the right direction.
You'll build strong, vibrant families, passing on the truth to the next generation.
You'll find yourself doing things you never expected – and having more impact than you ever imagined.
And who knows? You may even find yourself… running for president.
God has destined each of you for great things.
And I firmly believe that with His help, and your hard work, America's greatest days are still ahead.
My optimism for the future is grounded in my past.
I'm the proud daughter of Indian immigrants.
Fifty years ago, my parents came to America in search of a better life.
They found it in Bamberg, South Carolina – population 2,500.
Nobody knew who we were, what we were, or why we were there.
But my parents knew.
And every day, they reminded me, my brothers, and my sister that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America.
I've seen that blessing in countless ways, every day of my life.
As a brown girl, growing up in a black-and-white world, I saw the promise of America unfold before me.
As the proud wife of a combat veteran, I saw our people's incredible courage and love of freedom.
As Governor, I saw our state move beyond hate and violence, and lift up everyone in peace.
And as Ambassador, I saw that America is still the standard.
Where we lead, the world follows. When we speak, the world listens. Who we are, the world wants to be.
I'll never forget the day, as ambassador, when I stood on the Simon Bolivar bridge between Colombia and Venezuela.
I watched thousands of Venezuelans walk by, holding their babies, in the hot sun for hours, to get the one meal they might have that day. Where they came from, they'd been killing zoo animals for food.
They were fleeing socialism... and yearning for freedom.
When I left the bridge, the families started to gather around me. I didn't understand why they flocked to someone they'd never met.
And then it hit me.
They didn't care who I was. They cared where I was from.
In me, they saw America… and in America, they saw hope.
That's why my parents came to America. To this day, they're proud of that decision. I want to make sure they always are.
And I want you to be proud of America, too. You deserve to live in a country that respects your faith, protects your freedom, and gives you every opportunity to achieve your dreams.
If that's the America you want to live in, then live out your values in all you do.
I'm sure you will. After all, you've spent the last few years preparing.
As graduates of Regent University, you are uniquely ready to fulfill your calling. And I have faith you will help renew our country.
Let's do it together.
Congratulations, once again, to the Class of 2023. God bless you. God bless Regent University. And may God always bless the United States of America.

"Hutchinson Campaign Press Release - ICYMI: Gov. Asa Hutchinson is ""the 2024 Candidate Dems Should Fear""",2023-05-05T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/hutchinson-campaign-press-release-icymi-gov-asa-hutchinson-the-2024-candidate-dems-should,"
Gov. Hutchinson's conservative record and willingness to contrast himself with frontrunners sets him apart from the rest of the field
BENTONVILLE, Ark. — Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President as well as a former governor of Arkansas and official in President George W. Bush's administration, was recently featured in POLITICO's ""Deep Dive"" Podcast with Ryan Lizza which was the lead in this morning's POLITICO Playbook. Referred to as ""the 2024 candidate Dems should fear,"" this in-depth interview highlighted Governor Hutchinson's conservative bonafides as well as his willingness to contrast himself with the current frontrunners for the Republican nomination. In case you missed it, here are some key takeaways from today's coverage:


""Asa Hutchinson -- Not so long ago, if a former U.S. attorney, congressman, successful two-term governor ran for president in the GOP primary, they would be considered a top-tier presidential candidate.""


""If you talk to Democratic strategists about what kind of candidate they fear in 2024, there are a few things on their checklist:


Someone who knows how to speak in the language of inclusion


Someone who can discuss abortion and guns in a way that doesn't alienate suburban voters in states such as Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia


Someone who has a record of standing up to his own party on certain issues dominating the culture wars


Someone who can argue that he or she has almost as much governing experience as JOE BIDEN himself, but is still younger


Someone who handled the pandemic in their state in a way that avoided some of the most unpopular decisions of both Democrats and Republicans


And someone who spends a lot of their time explaining to Republicans why the GOP should leave Trump in the past.""


""But Asa Hutchinson sounds an awful lot like that imaginary candidate that Democrats fear.""


""I believe America is looking for a leader that is forward-looking and willing to bring out the best of America rather than someone who is focused on the past and appeals to our worst instincts,"" said Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican candidate for President and the former governor of Arkansas. ""I will continue to share my vision for America's future including how to repair our broken economy, slash government spending, reduce the size of the federal government, reinforce the rule of law, and foster the American Dream for generations to come.""

This article originally appeared on POLITICO.com.
If you talk to Democratic strategists about the 2024 presidential election, there is a certain type of Republican nominee who they fear: Someone who knows how to speak in the language of inclusion; who can discuss abortion and guns without alienating suburban voters; who stands up to the GOP on some of the most fraught issues of the culture wars; who can argue that he or she has almost as much government experience as Joe Biden himself, but is still younger; who handled the pandemic in their state in a way that avoided some of the most unpopular decisions of both Democrats and Republicans; and who spends a lot of their time explaining to Republicans why they should leave Donald Trump in the past.
Asa Hutchinson — who sounds an awful lot like that imaginary candidate that Democrats fear — is here on Playbook Deep Dive this week to tell us why you shouldn't count him out.
Hutchinson got his start in politics as a U.S. attorney during the Reagan Revolution, when his home state of Arkansas was still run by Democrats. He served two terms as governor and shortly after stepping down this year, he announced he's running for president.
If there's one thing that makes him stand out so far, it's that he's willing to say things about Trump that other Republicans aren't. Hutchinson recently wrote that the former President ""has led us astray,"" ""undermined the fabric of our democracy,"" and is emblematic of bad leaders who are, ""focused only on themselves or on settling scores with political opponents.""
In this episode of Playbook Deep Dive, host Ryan Lizza speaks with the former Arkansas governor after his first official trip to Iowa. He opens up about why he's running, how he thinks he can take down Trump, and why his record — which is among the most conservative in America — is full of surprises.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - It's Time for a Competency Test for Politicians. Here's Why.,2023-05-01T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-its-time-for-competency-test-for-politicians-heres-why,"
Fox News by Nikki Haley
America needs a new generation of leaders to renew our national strength and pride. It's why I support term limits for members of Congress, and why I've called for mental competency tests for politicians over the age of 75. To most Americans, this is common sense. But many political and media elites scoff at these ideas.
When I first called for competency tests, recently fired CNN host Don Lemon said I was the one ""past my prime."" Why? Because, in his mind, that describes all women over 50. He was widely and deservedly criticized for his backward views. But what's incredible is how the Washington establishment continues to cover for those who likely lack the mental acuity to do their job.
Take Sen. Dianne Feinstein. She's a trailblazer who's made an indelible mark in public service. But it's been obvious for quite some time that she's in significant mental and physical decline. She's missed months of votes and clearly can no longer do her job. I agree with several congressional Democrats who say Feinstein should resign immediately and let someone else who is able to do the job take over. At 89 years old, she is a prime example of why we need mental competency tests for politicians.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defends Feinstein, claiming that calls for her resignation are sexist. Pelosi said, ""I've never seen them go after a man who was sick in the Senate."" As I said after Mr. Lemon's comments, ""Madam Speaker, hold my beer."" This is not about whether someone is a woman. It's about whether they are up to the job.
The best case for such tests is in fact a man. He's a former senator and the sitting president.
Joe Biden announced his bid for re-election last week. If he wins next November, he will be 82 years old when he takes the oath of office, and 86 at the end of a second term. That would surpass the oldest president in American history by nine years.
That's not a problem in itself, but millions of Americans watch President Biden and believe he exhibits cognitive decline. He rarely takes press questions. He spends most weekends at his vacation home in Delaware. Sadly, he often seems disoriented and confused. Yet the public can't know for sure without a cognitive test, which Biden has either not taken or declines to publish as part of his medical records.
This uncertainty about Biden's mental competence means Americans must consider the actual competency of the vice president. Kamala Harris is one of the most incompetent elected officials in the country. Her failures in foreign policy and managing the border are too numerous to mention – to say nothing of the word salad that defines her unscripted remarks.
I wish Joe Biden the best of health, but it's only sensible to consider the reality of an already slipping president serving through his mid-80s. If Biden is re-elected, Harris would have the highest likelihood of becoming president in the middle of a term of any vice president ever. The question before voters in 2024 is, to an unprecedented degree, whether they want Kamala Harris to be president, not vice president.
The test I'm proposing for Sen. Feinstein, President Biden and others is not complicated or difficult. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test is a widely used tool for detecting cognitive decline. It involves rather simple things like naming animals, memorizing and recalling a few words, and listing words that begin with the same letter. They should both take the test, along with every other politician over the age of 75 – Republican or Democrat, man or woman – and publish the results.
This is not a qualification for office. Failing a mental competency test would not result in removal. It is about transparency. Voters deserve to know whether those who are making major decisions about war and peace, taxation and budgets, schools and safety, can pass a very basic mental exam.
Career politicians and elites oppose competency tests not because they are aimed at women like Sen. Feinstein, as Nancy Pelosi suggests. They dislike them because they don't want to hold the present leadership of our country accountable. They don't want a new generation to turn our country around. But that's what the American people deserve.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Courage of Conviction,2023-04-28T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-courage-conviction,"
Bedford Gazette
The more you love your decisions, the less you need others to love them."" — unknown
I'm usually content to be good old neutral Switzerland. I remain more of a mediator than an activist and will most likely always be an independent thinker. I've been a happy politically middling Independent, for years.
My dad was a staunch trade union, spendthrift Democrat and my mom was a socially and fiscally conservative Republican. We were a two-party family in a sad but realistic, two-party system. I naturally gravitated to the Independent middle, ideologically and socially.
Someone has changed my mind and I'm reluctantly surrendering my firm position as a registered Independent so that I can vote for Nikki Haley in the next presidential primary. This public confession is so not me, but I'm stepping off the cliff with the courage of conviction, something familiar to Ms. Haley.
In case you're unaware, Independents cannot vote in primary elections. Theoretically and logically, we should all be able to vote for our candidate of choice, no matter the party. But given the best system our nation could muster; logic does not always reign.
I'm encouraged that Nikki Haley is a minority, who isn't a victim. I'm not mad that she's conservative.
When she makes it easy to be envious of her accomplishments, I'm not jealous that this woman has won every race that she's entered, when I have clearly lost a few non-political ones. She's been bullied by the best of them, but powered through by the courage of her convictions and her desire to make a difference.
I'm inspired by tenacity. I'm motivated by an underdog who gets through the race, win or lose. I'm empowered by people who try their best, never give up, keep their heads up, and doggedly persist.
I grew up with a work ethic and I like hard work and hard workers. There is no way on this earth that I will ever believe that hard work is racist or wrong. So don't even attempt with such absurd thinking to convince me otherwise. It won't happen, and of this, I am sure.
Part of the work ethic is stick-to-it-iveness or persistence. The ethical factor in hard work is that you won't, even can't, quit until the job is done, the work is completed, and the goal is reached.
It isn't racist nor is it elitist to win. To strive to be better isn't unfair or out of balance. Competition isn't dominance as much as it's encouragement to try harder. If you're trying to be the best you won't consider settling for the least.
When you try, when you've done your best, when you've engaged and run the race, you've inspired someone, somewhere. That's the courage of conviction.
Having the stamina to struggle, to work, is a worthwhile goal as we age. So is getting smarter through education and critical thinking, and wiser through the experience of lessons learned. ""Work smarter, not harder,"" should be the mantra of the aging. It's easier on the joints. But work, we must.
Nikki Haley was an Accountant, first. She understands a balance sheet, cost-benefit ratio, and small business.
She never has belonged in the traditional kind of politics of double-speak, and constant talk but no action. Surely she's an introvert who thrives on meaningful conversation and has little time for small talk just to pass the time. I don't know her, but I'm offering an educated guess.
Nikki Haley is not confusing nor confused about anything. She says what she means and means what she says. That's the courage of conviction.
She has been a first before but that's not why she's running for President. She's running because she can do the job and this nation needs her, for such a time as this.
Some time ago, Haley said that South Carolina had enough politicians in their legislature but needed a good accountant. Don't we have enough self-serving politicians in Washington, but need a good, smart, governor, leader, ambassador, accountant, and loyal servant representing us in Washington? We need a leader with the courage of conviction.
""Courage is so rare nowadays, that one gets cornered for having courage of conviction and living by one's ideals. However, it is great to be cornered, since the corner with courage is never too crowded."" – Jeroninio Almeida

[As Prepared for Delivery.]
Thank you for joining Susan and me on this special day.
This is a day in which our nation's future . . . and my personal story comes together. Susan has been on this journey with me each step of the way. And Arkansas never had a better first lady.
Bentonville is a big part of my life story. But, so is Gravette where I grew up on a farm and learned the importance of family, faith, and community. I also learned hard work from my dad by cleaning out chicken houses and building fences. And my life story also includes Springdale, where I was inspired by teachers who pushed me to learn and it was in Springdale that my political awareness began with the nation's divide over the Vietnam War and the struggle for civil rights.
But, let's come back to Bentonville.
I was born in the old Bentonville Hospital; my first law office was across the square from where we stand today; I tried jury trials in this courthouse; I built Bentonville's first FM radio station; I served as Bentonville's City Attorney; and this is where Susan and I started our family and spent some of our happiest years living on 15 acres of rocks and hills west of town in a double-wide mobile home.
It was here on these steps, over 30 years ago, that I announced my run for the United States Senate. At that time Arkansas was a blue state and the Republican Party was pretty much non-existent. I stepped up to take on runaway federal spending; to fight for a strong national defense; to support the life of unborn children; and to unleash the private sector of our economy.
In other words, I ran as a conservative Republican when being a Republican was like having a career-ending handicap.
I continued to fight the establishment and over time . . . we won.
That was the beginning and since then I have been a consistent conservative through my time as leader of the party; in the U.S. Congress and as Governor.
And now, I bring that same vigor to fight another battle and that battle is for the future of our country and the soul of our party.
Today, I am announcing that I am a candidate for President of the United States.
In this campaign for President, I stand alone in terms of my experience, record, and leadership.
From Congress to DEA to Homeland Security, I have served our country in times of crisis.
As Governor of Arkansas, we cut taxes and created record surpluses.
We increased pay for teachers.
We reduced regulations; recruited industry, and the private sector grew by over 100,000 jobs.
My mettle has been tested.
It was tested when I put on a flak jacket and assisted the FBI Hostage Rescue Team in negotiating the surrender of an armed terrorist group.
My mettle was tested after the 9-11 attack when I was responsible for protecting the United States from another act of terrorism on U.S. soil.
And my mettle was tested once more as governor when I demonstrated how we can lead through a pandemic without closing down every business and shutting down schools.
When I had pressure from Washington and the national media to shelter in place, I said ""no"".
And the result was that our businesses survived and we had more days of in-classroom instruction during the pandemic than almost any other state. Yes, that's right . . . we beat Florida!
This campaign is about courage.
It is about making the tough decisions to rebuild our economy; to give peace a chance through America's strength, and to renew the American spirit of freedom . . .
Opportunity . . .
and the rule of law.
And we've got our work cut out for us. Let me offer some solutions.
First, we need to get our economy back on track.
The Biden Administration has turned its back on the American worker. To turn our economy around we have to stop the ""break-the-bank"" federal spending that has led to high inflation and rising interest rates.
Every hardworking American family gets a double hit from the Biden economy. Their paycheck doesn't go as far, and they are paying more on car loans and credit card debt because of the high-interest rates.
That is not acceptable.
I have been Chief Executive of our state for 8 years and that means I know how to balance a budget. I did it every single year.
And while I was in Congress, we balanced the federal budget and it is high time we did it again.
And that's just the beginning of what we must do together to bring out the best of America.
We must secure our Southern border. We need a pro-growth energy policy that is not focused on limits but on production. We should not limit American growth but rather we should unleash our energy producers.
And if America is to be the best; then we cannot yield to China in terms of global leadership.
When the Biden Administration conducted its disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, we left our friends abandoned and our allies confused.
America looked weak and that weakness was seen as an opportunity for Russia to invade Ukraine and then for China to threaten and be aggressive toward Taiwan.
Let me assure you that as President, I will bring out the best of America . . . we will stand with our allies and friends. We will not abandon our friends in times of need.
There are some who want the U.S. to disengage from the world and to isolate ourselves.
Isolationism only leads to weakness and weakness leads to war. Americans want peace and the best way to secure and preserve peace is to have the most prepared military in the world.
Today's threat is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I join with those who say we do not want an unending war in Ukraine, and the best way to avoid a long war is to help Ukraine win today.
As a nation, we have proven resilient in our democracy and we have endured through times of war and hardship. And I am confident we will even survive through the destructive policies of the Biden administration but the time for change is now. It is time to bring out the best of America.
As a nation, our democracy's resilience comes from our shared values and it comes from our willingness to sacrifice for the cause of freedom. We need leaders who understand the importance of democracy to our own freedoms and that with God's blessing, we set an example of liberty throughout the world.
America is democracy's lighthouse. We must not let the light be dimmed.
If freedom's light goes out in the United States then other countries will have their freedom shipwrecked on rocky shoals. Our democracy demands America's best and I will bring out America's best.
We will do this through leadership, economic growth, and respect for the rule of law.
The Biden Administration has stood on the sidelines and passively watched as rampant crime destroys our cities with smash-and-grab robberies and a flagrant disrespect for human dignity and the rule of law.
This must change.
What separates the United States from the rest of the world is our commitment to justice.
The rule of law is the foundation for peace in our communities. I am the only candidate running for President with a breadth of experience in law enforcement.
I will enforce the law and demand that local prosecutors do the same. Lawbreakers must be held accountable. Restoring respect for the law will not only reduce crime in our country; it will also bring out the best of America.
These are solutions that work for America.
The rule of law also applies to our southern border. I have three words that will work to protect our country from the human suffering that results from an open border. That is ""enforce the law"".
I know how to do this because President George W. Bush tapped me to help lead the Department of Homeland Security. Our nation is a land of immigrants who make up the fabric of our democracy. In order to respect those who follow the legal path to come to this country, we must reform our asylum laws; devote more resources to support our border patrol; quickly remove those who come into our country illegally; and go after the cartels who are killing Americans with the deadly drug fentanyl. When fentanyl is the leading cause of death for those 18 to 49 then we are losing our sons and daughters way too soon.
There are a few misguided leaders who say we should defund the FBI. I am here today in support of our law enforcement heroes. The argument to defund police is designed to undermine our rule of law.
We should not defund the FBI, but we do need serious reform to refocus the core functions of our federal law enforcement.
As someone who has worked with all the federal law enforcement agencies, I know what needs to be done. We must make them more focused, more accountable, and successful in protecting our citizens.
The FBI needs to be trimmed down and focused on its number one duty . . . leading our counter-terrorism mission. And when we support our law enforcement and enforce the rule of law we bring out the best of America.
Growing up in these hills, I learned the value of work. I hauled hay; worked in four different factories; sacked groceries; and through college, I was a janitor cleaning campus buildings.
All to pay the bills and to get an education.
In law school, I benefitted from the federal student loan program. And, yes, I paid my loan off!
In order to bring out the best of America, we must once again embrace the dignity of work! Our federal government should not reward those who sit at home when they have the ability to work and provide for themselves.
As Governor, I turned down federal assistance that discouraged a return to work. But the Biden Administration paid people more benefits to stay home than they could make working.
This is wrong.
As President, I will open doors for more worker training and better pay and we will require work for able-bodied welfare recipients.
This will grow our manufacturing workforce and we will prove that we can still make things in the United States.
An important solution to this challenge is lifting the penalties for those who want to stay in the workforce after the age of 62.
Right now, if you retire on Social Security, you are penalized for continuing to work. You should be able to both claim social security and work. Remove the penalties and let those who want to work continue to do so without government penalties.
Right now we have nearly 10 million job openings in the U.S. and by making this change we will add millions to the labor pool and increase the income of retirees at the same time. Yes, this will help bring out the best of America!
And when it comes to those who depend upon Social Security and Medicare, I will assure its strength and reliability into the future.
Right now, Social Security is financially stable until 2033. Medicare is stable until 2028. As we have successfully done in the past, I will immediately convene an independent Commission to Assure the Future of Social Security and Medicare.
This Commission will be modeled after the 1983 Commission that was chaired by Alan Greenspan. It led to legislation that successfully extended the life of these vital retirement programs for Americans.
Americans need to have confidence in their future and this action will stabilize and assure the future of a supplemental retirement program Americans depend upon.
As Governor of Arkansas, I expanded access to computer science education. It was a priority of mine and the result was going from 1,100 students who took computer science to over 23,000. We went from 20 certified teachers to over 650 who are certified to teach computer science. We made it required to be offered in our rural schools as well as our urban schools. The result is that Arkansas led the nation in computer science education and made a real difference in the opportunities for young people.
It is critical that we follow this model as a nation if we are going to compete with Communist China. The fact is that U.S. test scores in math and science are falling behind other countries. The top 5 math scoring countries are in Asia and the United States places 11th as a nation in terms of math education. We must do better for our students.
As President, I will expand computer science education into every grade school and high school.
I will focus our higher education to produce more engineers and scientists. And when we do, we can not only compete with China but we will bring out the best of America!
We can once again define America's future with the genius and creativity of our people.
Too often, our businesses and families are held back by a federal bureaucracy that is out of control, heavy-handed and wasteful. As President, I will reduce the federal civilian workforce by 10%!
You can believe me when I say I will do this because I have done it. In Arkansas, I reduced the state executive workforce by 14%. And there is a lot more room for improvement in Washington.
We will reduce the burden of government; we will lower the federal deficit, and we will unleash the power of the private sector. Our families will have more to spend and save for their children's future.
Both Democratic and Republican Administrations bear responsibility for our current $31 Trillion national debt. I would like to say we will be ""Debt Free in 33"". Well, it might take longer; but we must start.
I am from the heartland of America.
I am the son of Malcolm and Coral Hutchinson who were married during the Great Depression, who served our country during World War II, and who sacrificed to make sure their six children had a chance to live their dreams and to be all that God required of them.
They taught me that we are all equal and we all struggle in life. And because we struggle we need grace and compassion toward others. It is my hope that those farmland values will once again guide our nation and bring us closer together.
And if you look at our history, the United States of America has been challenged in every generation from threats abroad to civil unrest at home. And when we are tested we grow stronger.
We have learned that in times of turmoil, uncertainty, and division, America has always benefited from leaders who challenge us and give us hope. I am confident that America is ready to seek new frontiers; and that we are ready to channel the restless waves of our democracy into more freedom and more prosperity for those who follow after us.
I am running for President because I know that the best of America is ahead of us.
There is behind me, on the Courthouse wall, a statement that is the foundation of our nation: ""Sovereignty rests with the people.""
This means that you will decide the direction of our nation.
The fate of the world's greatest democracy is in your hands.
Thank you and May God Bless the United States of America!

Hutchinson Campaign Press Release - Former Arkansas Gov. Hutchinson Formally Announces 2024 Presidential Campaign,2023-04-26T00:00:00+00:00,Asa Hutchinson,/documents/hutchinson-campaign-press-release-former-arkansas-gov-hutchinson-formally-announces-2024,"
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson formally kicked off his presidential campaign on Wednesday with a speech in Bentonville, Arkansas, seeking to distinguish himself from the GOP field with his long career in government and as a ""consistent conservative.""
""Today, I am announcing that I am a candidate for president of the United States,"" Hutchinson said. ""In this campaign for president, I stand alone in terms of my experience, record and leadership.""
In his speech, Hutchinson touched upon plans to address the economy, crime, and border security – issues that fit with his public service record. But the former governor, who's working to build national name recognition, also highlighted his personal story of growing up on a farm in a small town.
Bentonville is where Hutchinson announced his first run for public office and part of the district he used to represent when he was in the US House of Representatives. He was joined by family, friends and supporters, who traveled across the state to support the former governor on Wednesday.
Hutchinson announced his bid for the GOP presidential nomination during an interview with ABC News earlier this month. But he's been polling in the single digits, while former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to jump into the race, are well ahead of him and the rest of the competition.
Core to Hutchinson's argument for election is he has the credentials and temperament to win a general election and that if Trump is the Republican nominee, the former president can't appeal to enough voters to beat President Joe Biden.
Without mentioning Trump by name in Wednesday's speech, Hutchinson attacked the former president's ""America First"" agenda.
""There are some who want the US to disengage from the world and to isolate ourselves,"" he said, adding, ""isolationism only leads to weakness and weakness leads to war.""
Later, he hit squarely on Trump's recent calls to defund the FBI.
Surrounded by local businesses and restaurants in Bentonville's town square, Hutchinson, whose time as governor ended in January, touted his efforts to keep Arkansas strong during the Covid-19 pandemic. He said his ""mettle was tested"" when he faced pressure from Washington to enact Covid restrictions.
""I demonstrated how we can lead through a pandemic without closing down every business and shutting down schools,"" he said.
With a thinly veiled swipe at DeSantis, Hutchinson said, ""The result was that our businesses survived, and we had more days of in-classroom instruction during the pandemic than almost any other state. Yes, that's right. We beat Florida and Texas.""
He promised, if elected president, that he would set up a commission to ensure the future of Social Security and Medicare, expand computer science education in every K-12 school to compete with China, and cut the federal civilian workforce by 10%.
Hutchinson has spent much of his career in public service. The former Arkansas governor served as federal prosecutor, in the House of Representatives, and as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration and as a Department of Homeland Security undersecretary during the Bush administration.
Wilma Donley, who drove to the event from Little Rock, told CNN she that she's supporting Hutchinson because ""we need some civility back in our country.""
""We are in bad shape right now. And I feel he's the one that can put the civility back into campaigning,"" said Donley, who's voted for both parties in the past and told CNN she supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The former governor acknowledged on CNN earlier this month that ""perhaps I'm not as exciting as some candidates that are out there. I don't throw bombs and torches all the time.""
""But I am consistent, I have a track record that's important. And I have a vision for America, for border security, for the fentanyl crisis – and so things that we can bring people together, I think that's a great characteristic and history that I bring,"" he added.

"Remarks Delivering a Policy Speech on Abortion in Arlington, Virginia",2023-04-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/remarks-delivering-policy-speech-abortion-arlington-virginia,"
Thank you, Marjorie. And thank you to the Susan B. Anthony List for its tireless work on behalf of innocent children and moms.
My subject today is the conversation around abortion. It's a sensitive topic that deserves our attention. It's one that too many politicians either demagogue or hide from. I won't demagogue or hide from it.
I'm here to speak about it directly and openly. I won't address every possible question or angle. Rather, I aim to start a constructive conversation about where we go from here in our divided country.
Abortion is a deeply personal topic for both women and men. I understand why. Someone's body and someone else's life are not things to be taken lightly, and they should not be politicized. The issue should be addressed with sensitivity and respect, not judgment and hate.
Most people have a story that has brought them to their views about abortion. It could be a personal experience. It could be a trauma that a family member or friend endured. It could be a moral conviction. It could be our concerns for our daughters and their future.
This is my story.
I am pro-life. I am unapologetic and unhesitant about it. Not because the Republican Party tells me to be. But for very personal reasons.
My husband was adopted, and I am reminded of that blessing every day.
Michael's birth parents lived in poverty. His father was an alcoholic and in and out of prison. His mother suffered a traumatic brain injury.
When he was just a few years old, Michael and his siblings were taken from their home. Later, they were put in foster care. It was a rough experience for him.
Thankfully, when he was four, a loving family adopted Michael and his younger sister. It changed their lives. Adoption literally saved them.
Every day is a blessing because someone gave him life. Every day is a blessing because a family loved and raised him under difficult circumstances. The world is better because of Michael Haley. He's an amazing father and husband. He's a combat veteran who served our country in war. He continues to help adoption and at-risk youth causes because he wants to help others who were born in his situation.
I often think about what would have happened if Michael hadn't been so blessed … if his biological mother had chosen a different path.
My husband is reason number one that I stand for life. Every day I get to spend with the love of my life reminds me that I am blessed that someone saved his life.
The second reason is that Michael and I struggled to have children of our own.
I had many challenges as a teenager into my college years. I went through numerous surgeries. When Michael and I were married, I couldn't wait to be a mom. But what happened so easily for many of my friends was not my path. We went through countless sessions of fertility treatments.
Every day I wake up and see or speak to my two children I feel blessed. The greatest job I will ever have is being their mom.
Our eldest got married just ten days ago. I will never forget the day she was born and then seeing her walk down the wedding aisle with her dad. I felt what countless parents feel. Love. Pride. Overpowering joy.
I believe every life is a blessing from God. My heart hurts when someone decides not to go through with a pregnancy.
My record on abortion is long and clear.
As a state legislator, I voted for every pro-life bill that came before me.
We made it easier for women to get ultrasounds.
We required a 24-hour wait before abortions.
As Governor, we passed the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, protecting babies born during botched abortions.
I signed a law protecting unborn babies from the moment they can feel pain.
We also launched initiatives that paired thousands of vulnerable first-time moms with nurses who had specialized training in maternal and child health.
I kept up the fight as ambassador to the United Nations.
And I'm not done yet.
My goal as president will be the same as when I was Governor and Ambassador.
I want to save as many lives and help as many moms as possible.
This mission has become more urgent in the past year.
With the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, we entered a new era. It's really a return to the way this issue was decided in our country for nearly two centuries.
Until 1973, abortion was not a federal issue. Each state decided where it stood. Many had restrictive laws. Some had more permissive laws.
Yes, the issue was controversial, but the citizens of each state reached a consensus that reflected their values.
Then, in 1973, the Supreme Court changed that. It declared the entire nation must follow one standard. A standard determined not by the American people, but by unelected judges. And that standard was among the most liberal in the world.
Overnight, 46 states saw their abortion laws thrown out. State-level consensus was replaced with a national mandate that much of the country found deeply offensive.
Last year, the Court returned power to the American people. We are now free to forge consensus once again.
In the past year, we've started to see what that looks like.
Some states have passed laws protecting life. I commend them for it.
Other states have doubled down on abortion. I wish that weren't the case, but it is.
Different people in different places are taking different paths. That's what the founders of our country envisioned. It's the reality of living in a democracy.
But it's equally true that in a democracy, things can change. Tomorrow can be better than today. And I believe we will make even more progress in the cause of life.
That is the challenge we face as pro-life advocates – to move America toward life.
I said I want to save as many lives and help as many moms as possible. That is my goal. To do that at the federal level, the next president must find national consensus.
That might sound strange to many people.
Under Roe, consensus was replaced by demonization. And let's be honest: most in the media promote demonization. They stoke division pitting Americans against each other.
No one talks about finding consensus. Everyone goes to the barricades and attacks the other side.
They've turned a sensitive issue that has long divided people into a kind of gotcha bidding war.
How many weeks are you for? How many exceptions are you for? And so on. But these questions miss the point if the goal is saving as many lives as possible.
You don't save any lives if you can't enact your position into law. And you can't do that unless you find consensus.
Reaching consensus starts with humanizing, not demonizing. Just like I have my story, I respect everyone who has their story. I don't judge someone who is pro-choice any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life.
Today, each state is finding its own consensus, as they should.
Nationally, however, the task is much harder. As a practical matter, you only achieve consensus when you have a House majority, a 60-vote Senate majority, and a president who are all in alignment.
We are nowhere close to reaching that point. Today, there are around 45 pro-life senators, depending on how you count them. There haven't been 60 Republican senators since 1910. It could happen one day. But it hasn't happened in over a hundred years, and it's unlikely to happen soon.
We have to face this reality. The pro-life laws that have passed in strongly Republican states will not be approved at the federal level.
That's just a fact, notwithstanding what the Democrat fearmongers say. They say Republicans are about to ban all abortions nationwide and send women to prison. These wildly false claims, amplified by a sympathetic media, are not designed to do anything other than score political points.
They know as well as anyone that no Republican president will have the ability to ban abortion nationwide, just as no Democratic president can override the laws of all fifty states. It's just not going to happen.
But that does not mean we can't save as many lives as possible.
I do believe there is a federal role on abortion. Whether we can save more lives nationally depends entirely on doing what no one has done to date – finding consensus. That's what I will strive to do.
In fact, I believe common ground already exists.
There is broad public agreement that babies born during a failed abortion deserve to live. They need medical care and the full protection of the law, just like every other baby.
There is broad public agreement that we should never pressure moms into having an abortion. They should get support to carry their baby to term. They should be able to get information from pregnancy resource centers – and especially about adoption.
We must do better when it comes to adoption, to make it easier for adoptive parents, and to avoid children growing up in a government system with too little love.
We can broadly agree that pro-life doctors and nurses should never be forced to violate their beliefs. The right of conscience matters just as much as the right to life.
Surely, we can all agree that abortion up until the time of birth is a bridge too far. Only seven countries on earth allow elective late-term abortions. We're talking brutal regimes like Communist China and North Korea.
We should be able to agree that contraception should be more available, not less.
And we can all agree that women who get abortions should not be jailed. A few have even called for the death penalty. That's the least pro-life position I can possibly imagine.
Those are just some areas where national consensus is already within reach. There are others too, and we should do the hard work to find them through heartfelt dialogue.
Sadly, finding consensus is the last thing on the mind of many of today's political and media class.
Conflict makes for good fundraising copy and scary TV ads. Consensus doesn't get a lot of ratings or clicks.
Hating and judging each other has become the norm instead of respecting one's personal story.
I would remind those on the Left who demonize anyone who is pro-life, that it was not too long ago when President Bill Clinton said he wanted abortion to be ""safe, legal, and rare.""
Few Democrats say ""rare"" anymore.
Just the opposite. Many want legal abortion anytime, for any reason, at any stage of pregnancy, in every state and town in America.
Some radical activists are even lighting pregnancy resource centers on fire. These are not the voices of consensus. They are acts of division and hatred.
President Biden has done nothing to discourage it. In fact, he promotes it. That's not leadership. It's more partisanship of the worst kind.
Pro-life political leaders and candidates must not put up with being demonized. We should call out the extremism of the Left.
We don't need a president who endangers lives while dividing our country even more. We need a president who unites Americans and brings out the best in them, even on the toughest of subjects.
That will be my approach as president. I believe in conversation.
I believe in compassion.
I believe in empathy, not anger.
We're not just talking about policy here. We're talking about people.
That's often lost in this debate, on the left and the right. But it's front of mind for me.
I acknowledge the humanity of both the unborn baby and the pregnant mom.
I know how hard pregnancy can be.
Some days, you're so sick you can't get out of bed. You worry if you're really up for raising a baby. And you know you're going to need a lot of help.
That's what I felt during my pregnancies. Many women have it much harder. I desperately wanted a child. I had a loving family eager to help out. But some moms never wanted to be pregnant at all. Some are single with no one to help – with no idea how to raise a baby while keeping a job.
I had a friend who was raped. I know the anguish she went through worrying that she would have an unwanted pregnancy. It was an anguish I wouldn't wish on anyone.
We can't ignore the fears those women face.
I will never downplay these difficulties as I fight for life. And I won't demonize those who disagree with me.
We can't give into outrage culture and accuse our opponents of being evil. That's self- defeating.
If we want to protect more moms and save more babies, we need more Americans to join with us. We must persuade people and find consensus, not push them further away.
I know we can do it.
I've done it before.
Eight years ago, when I was governor, I encountered the most difficult challenge of my life.
A sick and twisted young man walked into Mother Emanuel Church, in Charleston. He joined a bible study of African Americans, sat and prayed with them for over an hour, then opened fire. He murdered nine amazing souls. He openly said he did it because of the color of their skin.
In the awful days that followed, photos emerged of the killer posing with the Confederate Flag. Amid our grief, a massive debate broke out. It centered on the Confederate Flag that flew on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse.
Our state had been bitterly divided on the flag for decades. On one side were those who wanted to tear it down. On the other side were those who wanted to keep the flag. Both were united in sadness over the Mother Emanuel murders. But they were divided about what the flag meant, and what taking it down would mean.
The debate was intense. People wondered if South Carolina would break out in violence and destruction like what we had recently seen in Ferguson, Missouri and other places.
But we didn't.
In that fraught moment, I gave a speech. I said, quote:
""For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history, of heritage and of ancestry… At the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive, as we have done, while still being home to both of those viewpoints. We do not need to declare a winner and loser.""
And so, I said, it was time to remove the Confederate Flag from the statehouse grounds.
This was no easy task. It was a highly emotional issue in our state. And removal required a two-thirds vote in both our State House and Senate.
But several days later, large, diverse, and bipartisan majorities in our state legislature voted to bring down the flag.
We found consensus on a very tough issue. Republicans and Democrats worked together and made progress by talking to each other like human beings. We saw past our differences, and united to move forward, as one state and one people.
What was true then, with the flag, can be true now, with abortion.
This shouldn't be about one movement winning, and another one losing.
This shouldn't be about picking sides, scoring points, or stoking outrage.
It's about saving babies and supporting moms.
I am fighting for all of them, and I will work with anyone to do that.
I have faith we can make progress. I have faith we can save more lives, and give every baby, mother, and family the best shot at the best life.
Our national history should give us hope.
Time and again, the American people have confronted great wrongs, and worked hard to convince their fellow citizens to make them right.
Think back to the abolitionists. They spent the better part of a century striving to end our original sin of slavery.
Think back to the suffragettes. It took them even longer to secure the support of their fellow citizens for women's right to vote.
Think back to the leaders of the civil rights movement. Their tireless work showed America that segregation was wrong, and equality was right.
Think about the progress we're already making in the restoration of the right to life. Fifty years ago, a court forced unlimited abortion on an unwilling nation.
Millions of Americans responded – not with rage, but with resolve.
They reminded our fellow citizens about the humanity of the unborn child and the needs of pregnant mothers.
Now that power has been restored to the people. Let us treat it as the important and deeply personal issue it is. Let's discuss it in ways that allow Americans to show love for one another, not judgment or contempt. And let's find a consensus that allows us to save as many babies as we can while supporting women in difficult situations.
I am ready for the hard work that lies ahead. And I'm confident we can move together, toward our founding promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Blasts Biden as 'Weakest President in Modern History' After Re-election Announcement,2023-04-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-blasts-biden-weakest-president-modern-history,"
Fox News by Houston Keene
Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley blasted President Biden as the ""weakest president in modern history"" after his presidential re-election campaign announcement.
Haley, the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, torched Biden in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital after his campaign video announcement.
""Biden has been the weakest president in modern history,"" Haley said. ""Under his administration, we've had a disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, an unprecedented border crisis, the worst inflation in 40 years, and an emboldened enemy in China.""
""It's time to retire Joe Biden and make America strong and proud again,"" Haley added.
Haley's campaign also dropped a new video blasting Biden and his presidency as failures while citing high inflation, the ""wide-open southern border,"" and the ""botched Afghanistan withdrawal.""
The GOP presidential contender's comments came after Biden announced he and Vice President Kamala Harris would be on the same ticket again for 2024.
Biden and Harris released their official presidential announcement video on Tuesday, vowing to ""finish the job"" they started, to mixed reviews online and with the president's potential 2024 Republican challengers.
Americans online weren't fully convinced, however, with many expressing their trepidation on what finishing ""the job"" actually means.
""Finish what job, destroying America?"" Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson tweeted.
""After seeing the damage Joe Biden has done to America in the last two years, I am terrified to learn what 'finishing the job' looks like,"" journalist Jason Robinson wrote.
Democrats online were more thrilled about the second Biden-Harris ticket, with progressive super political action committee (PAC) Priorities USA executive director Danielle Butterfield celebrating the news in a Tuesday press release.
""Over the past two years, President Biden and Vice President Harris have boldly led our country through a devastating pandemic and an unprecedented economic recovery,"" Butterfield said. ""From expanding affordable healthcare and fighting climate change to passing the largest gun safety law in 30 years, and even more, it's abundantly clear that President Biden is a dynamic force for change.""
""Still, the work isn't over,"" Butterfield continued, claiming that every ""day, extremist MAGA Republicans are plotting to further unravel the fabric of our democracy whether it be through constant attacks on the right to an abortion, the right to marry or the right to vote.""
""President Biden has consistently proven his ability to fend off these insidious threats while navigating extreme polarization,"" she continued. ""Now it's time to finish the job.""

Video Remarks Announcing Candidacy for Re-election,2023-04-25T00:00:00+00:00,Joseph R. Biden,/documents/video-remarks-announcing-candidacy-for-re-election,"
Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.
That's been the work of my first term: To fight for our Democracy. This shouldn't be a red or blue issue. To protect our rights. To make sure that everyone in this country is treated equally. And that everyone is given a fair shot at making it.
But, you know, around the country, MAGA extremists are lining up to take those bedrock freedoms away. Cutting social security that you've paid for your entire life while cutting taxes for the very wealthy. Dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. All while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.
When I ran for President four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are. The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.
I know what I want the answer to be and I think you do too. This is not a time to be complacent.
That's why I'm running for re-election.
Because I know America. I know we are good and decent people. I know we are still a country that believes in honesty and respect, and treating each other with dignity. That we're a nation where we give hate no safe harbor. We believe that everyone is equal, and that everyone should be given a fair shot to succeed in this country.
Every generation of Americans has faced a moment when they have to defend democracy. Stand up for our personal freedom. Stand up for the right to vote and our civil rights.
And this is our moment.
So if you're with me, go to JoeBiden.com and sign up. Let's finish this job, I know we can.
Because this is the United States of America. And there's nothing, simply nothing, we cannot do if we do it together.

Haley Campaign Press Release - What People Are Saying About Haley's Abortion Speech,2023-04-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-what-people-are-saying-about-haleys-abortion-speech,"
CHARLESTON, S.C. – This morning, presidential candidate Nikki Haley delivered a major policy speech on abortion at the Susan B. Anthony List headquarters in Virginia. Her speech is being widely praised for standing for principle, while showing respect and understanding for the deeply personal nature of this issue. 
CBN's David Brody: ""Just finished attending @NikkiHaley pro-life speech at @sbaprolife. She says, 'I do believe there is a federal role on abortion...the next president must find national consensus.' She's STRONG on this because it's heartfelt. It's not just a checkmark for her. PITCH PERFECT today."" (Twitter, 04/25/23)

Wall Street Journal's Kimberley Strassel: ""I thought it was very brave of her. And by the way she carved out a position that you may see other candidates follow on the Republican side. She said, I'm very pro-life, but this needs to be something that, at least at the federal level, we need to be working harder to find consensus between both sides."" (Fox News, 04/25/23)
Former Republican Congresswoman Nan Hayworth: ""I thought it was a superb speech for a national audience as well. She approached her Republican audience with respect. She staked out a position that certainly the majority of Republicans hold, which is protective of life. But she also spoke movingly and cogently about the need to work towards a consensus. It was a nuanced reference, but you can hear her saying, look, if we can't work cooperatively with the other side of the aisle and with Americans who feel differently, that's a losing position for us. And I agree with her on that. I thought it was a superb speech, and she now sets the bar for her fellow Republicans in this primary race."" (NewsMax, 04/25/23)
Reuters: ""Haley and her staff have often portrayed her as uniquely positioned to talk about abortion and other issues that affect women, given that all other candidates in the Republican field are men. During the speech, Haley spoke of personal experiences, including her own difficulty conceiving."" (Reuters, 04/25/23)
The State: ""Haley's speech was at times deeply personal, relating her husband's adoption, her own struggles to conceive, and the 'anguish' a friend felt after being raped and worrying that she would have an unwanted pregnancy. The former South Carolina governor also cited her own experience removing the Confederate Flag from the statehouse in Columbia as proof that she is able to find compromise on emotionally difficult issues."" (The State, 04/25/23)
CNN's Kylie Atwood: ""She called for a constructive conversation to try and find consensus on this sensitive issue. Essentially making the case, John, that there is more of a middle ground on the issue of abortion than most folks give credit to when they have discussions on this topic. And one of the things that she really honed in on is why she is pro-life. She spoke about her personal experience, her husband being adopted. She also talked about having challenges conceiving her own children, and those are two of the main central reasons that she said she's pro-life….She did say that generally speaking the conversation on this topic, from her viewpoint, is just too divisive."" (CNN, 04/25/23)
Bloomberg: ""Presidential contender Nikki Haley called for a 'national consensus' on abortion and urged her party to acknowledge the limits of federal action on the issue, which has vexed fellow Republicans eager to win over women and swing-state voters."" (Bloomberg, 04/25/23)
Washington Examiner's Tiana Lowe: "".@NikkiHaley is correct. Only focusing limiting on the supply side of abortion (restrictions) is not truly pro-life. Republicans like Haley and Sen. Ernst have excelled at focusing on reducing demand (contraception deregulation)"" (Twitter, 04/25/23)

NewsNation: ""Nikki Haley came out today in her speech talking about how, yes she does have a certain stance on abortion. But when it comes to voters and how they actually feel about the issue it is way more nuanced. It should not be the polarizing issue that it's made out to be by the democrats."" (NewsNation, 04/25/23)
MSNBC's Ali Vitali: ""You've got the only woman in this field taking the issue head on as opposed to some of her other rivals who are being more reactive in their stances on the abortion issue. But for Haley, being here was not as much about specifics, as it is in her way, of just trying to lay the groundwork that she wants to set, not necessarily a week mark, not even necessarily what she plans to do specifically on this issue, but instead trying to build, in her words, consensus, on one of the thorniest issues of our time….We're watching Haley work from the most extreme positions on both sides back towards some sort of middle."" (MSNBC, 04/25/23)
NBC News' Allan Smith: ""Nikki Haley getting out ahead of her GOP presidential rivals in delivering a speech to outline her abortion position"" (Twitter, 04/25/23)

Haley Campaign Press Release - Don Bolduc: Nikki Haley Will Secure Our Border,2023-04-18T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-don-bolduc-nikki-haley-will-secure-our-border,"
New Hampshire Union Leader by Don Bolduc
At a recent town hall in Dover, presidential candidate Nikki Haley put a marker down on one of the biggest security issues facing America: ""We will stop catch-and-release and start catch-and-deport.""
She's right.
It's no secret that America has a crisis at its southern border — an economic, national security, and health crisis that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. New Hampshire is no stranger to this crisis. Opioid overdose deaths are spiking in our cities and towns and Joe Biden doesn't seem to care.
Over the two-plus years of his administration, Biden did everything to make the problem worse. He reversed Title 42, which kept the border closed during the COVID pandemic. He threw open the floodgates to drug cartels and laid down a welcome mat with ""catch-and-release."" His administration is more concerned with climate change and gender pronouns than the thousands of young Americans being taken too soon by fentanyl overdoses.
Biden's Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas refused to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" when asked if there is a ""crisis"" at our southern border during a Senate hearing.
To quote Nikki Haley, Joe Biden ""is asleep at the wheel.""
Here's the good news. Nikki Haley has the experience and determination to secure the border and stop the flow of illegal immigrants and deadly drugs. As governor of South Carolina, Nikki didn't wait for the Obama administration to do something about illegal immigration. She tackled the issue head on. Only six months into her administration, Haley signed one of the toughest bills on illegal immigration in the country.
The bill expanded law enforcement's ability to check a person's immigration status and required South Carolina employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the citizenship status of employees and job applicants. It also banned illegal immigrants from receiving state or local benefits and increased penalties for violating immigration law.
The Left went crazy, but Nikki didn't back down. When the Obama administration tried to stymie the state's E-Verify mandate, Nikki went to battle and denounced Obama's obstinacy.
""We are not going to be quiet about it,"" she said. ""This is something we take seriously in South Carolina. I'm going to be loud about it… I'm the daughter of immigrant parents. They came here legally. They paid their time; they paid their price. They are offended by those that come here illegally. We are a country of laws. When we give up being a country of laws we are giving up everything this country is founded on.""
Nikki knows what's at stake. Her parents came to America from India with nothing because of the promise of a better life. As she likes to say, she was able to live the American Dream because of their sacrifice. But that dream won't be available to future generations if we weaken the rule of law. And it won't be available if we don't stop the flow of deadly opioids from China and Mexico.
Nikki laid out her plan for securing the border at her New Hampshire town halls. She committed to enacting a national E-Verify program, hiring 25,000 new Border Patrol and ICE agents, and stopping handouts to illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities. Just one month into her candidacy, she visited the border to see Biden's border crisis firsthand. For those who are keeping count, it took Joe Biden two years to do that.
It's clear Biden doesn't care about or isn't capable of safeguarding American security. It's also clear that we need a leader who knows what we stand to lose. Nikki Haley has always been a problem solver. That's what she did as South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. And that's what she will do as president of the United States.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Hauls in Over $11 Million in First Six Weeks of Her 2024 GOP Presidential Campaign,2023-04-07T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-hauls-over-11-million-first-six-weeks-her-2024,"
Fox News by Paul Steinhauser
EXCLUSIVE – Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley brought in more than $11 million in fundraising during the first six weeks of her campaign, according to figures shared first with Fox News on Wednesday.
Haley's campaign highlighted her grassroots support, noting that the former two-term South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during former President Trump's administration received 70,000 donations from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with 67,000 of those contributions under $200.
Haley declared her candidacy in mid-February, and her report includes money raised through the end of the first quarter of 2023 fundraising, which concluded on March 31.
""In just six weeks, Nikki Haley's massive fundraising and active retail campaigning in early voting states makes her a force to be reckoned with,"" said Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney. ""Voters and donors are clearly responding to Nikki's conservative message and her call for a new generation of leadership to make America strong and proud.""
Haley's $11 million outpaces the $9.5 million Trump raised during the first six weeks of his 2024 campaign, from his launch in mid-November through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 fundraising at the end of the year. Trump has yet to report his first quarter of 2023 fundraising figures, but his campaign highlighted that he brought in $8 million in the first four days following his indictment in New York City last Thursday. Roughly half of Trump's haul came after the end of the first quarter.
Haley's campaign spotlighted that their candidate's fundraising also outpaced nearly all the GOP presidential contenders running in the crowded 2016 nomination race during their first quarters as official candidates.
According to the campaign, Haley headed into April with $7.8 million cash on hand in her coffers, with South Carolina, Florida and Texas as her top three fundraising states. Fundraising, along with public opinion polling, is a key metric in determining a candidate's strength and grassroots appeal. Additionally, fundraising dollars can be used to build up candidate's campaign structure and to pay for travel and ads.
Haley's team pointed out that during the first six weeks of her campaign, she also held 19 events in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.
While Haley and the rest of the field of actual and potential Republican White House contenders remain far behind Trump in the latest 2024 GOP nomination polls, Haley told Fox News following a town hall in New Hampshire last week that her emphasis on candidate-to-voter, retail style politics can help her capture her party's presidential nomination.
Apparently taking aim at Trump without naming him, Haley said that she is ""not going to focus on doing big rallies… You have to go and answer the hard questions. You have to go face-to-face. You can't fly in and fly out. I believe the American people want you to earn their vote.""
Annie Dickerson, one of Haley's major donors and the founder and chair of Winning for Women PAC, noted that she has seen Haley ""in action both at donor events and on the ground in Iowa, and her ability to connect with people continues to impress me. Nikki puts in the time and the hard work; she shakes every hand, takes every picture, and answers every question.""
Bill Strong, a Florida-based donor, pointing to Haley's resume and electoral track record, noted that ""Nikki is the only one with executive and foreign policy experience and a proven track record of winning tough races.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - 2024 Hopeful Nikki Haley Says Biden Doesn't 'Deserve to be President' After Visiting Border: 'Shame on You',2023-04-06T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-2024-hopeful-nikki-haley-says-biden-doesnt-deserve-be,"
Fox News by Elizabeth Heckman
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley became the first 2024 White House hopeful to visit the southern border, Monday, highlighting President Biden's security failures and touting her own plan to address the ongoing migrant crisis.
Haley joined ""The Faulkner Focus"" from Del Rio, Texas, ahead of her planned press conference with Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, on her visit.
""What I'd say to President Biden is, shame on you. Shame on you because you are putting every single American at risk. This is a national security threat… this is your job, your job is to protect the American people. You're not doing it, you don't deserve to be president,"" Haley said, adding that what she's witnessed has been a ""dereliction of duty.""
""I don't know why the Democrats are allowing him to run,"" she continued. ""We can't allow this to continue to happen. Biden thinks if he doesn't talk about it, it doesn't exist. But for the people now in Hondo, Texas, for the people here now in Del Rio, it does exist every day. And now it is in every state in the country.""
Haley, who is a daughter of legal immigrants, has been rolling out her plan to secure the border and tackle illegal immigration. That plan would see the recent funding for up to 87,000 IRS staff scrapped in favor of 25,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
The plan would also mandate that businesses use E-Verify — which verifies a worker's citizenship and immigration status — in their hiring processes. As governor of South Carolina, Haley had signed a bill requiring all businesses in the state to use the tool.
""We are a country of laws. The second you stop being a country of laws, you give up everything this country was founded on,"" she told host Harris Faulkner.
Additionally, a Haley administration would cut funding to states that have been used to give money to illegal immigrants — such as the billions used by New York to cut checks to illegal immigrant workers who lost their jobs during the pandemic.
Her plan would also restore the Trump-era ""Remain-in-Mexico"" policy — which kept migrants in Mexico while their immigration hearings proceeded, instead of releasing them into the U.S. Republicans have credited that policy with reducing the pull factors which drew migrants north. Haley is also promising to end the ""catch-and-release"" practices of the Biden administration.
""This is not a campaign issue,"" she said. ""This is a national security issue. And the people of Texas and every state in the country don't deserve what's happening right now."" 
Haley's remarks came as former President Donald Trump departed Florida for New York City ahead of his Tuesday arraignment on criminal charges related to business fraud. Haley condemned Democrats for drumming up ""political drama"" and taking attention away from the border.
""We should be talking about the fact that every state is now a border state. We had 70,000 people die of fentanyl and synthetic opioid deaths in 2021. You've got the number one cause of death for 18 to 49-year-olds is now synthetic opioids. Yet we're talking about the political revenge of a former president. It doesn't make sense. And it's why the New York prosecutors are trying to waste our time. But the American people need to remember this is what counts. This is what we need to be talking about. And this is where the focus needs to be because this is a national security threat to every American family.""
There were over 1.7 million encounters at the southern border in FY 2021, and more than 2.3 million in FY 2022. FY 2023 has been on pace to eclipse those numbers, although numbers have dipped in January and February.
""This should be a top priority for anybody running for president. If it's not a top priority for our current president, it will be a top priority when I'm president,"" she concluded.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - See Biden's Big Border Mess With Your Own Eyes,2023-04-05T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-see-bidens-big-border-mess-with-your-own-eyes,"
New York Post by Nikki Haley
The Biden administration refuses to say that what's happening at the border is a crisis.
But it plainly is a crisis. I saw it with my own eyes Monday.
I traveled to the border with Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales. His district has 800 miles along the border.
Standing on the edge of the Rio Grande in Del Rio, surrounded by local law enforcement, I looked into Mexico.
The next wave of illegal immigrants was going to come over at any moment.
I saw the piles of trash from earlier crossings, including baby formula and baby shoes.
I saw the footprints, some just hours old, from people who broke the law to come here.
Some are families in search of a better life.
Others are criminals and child traffickers who get rich ruining lives.
Earlier, I saw the grief of families who live near the border.
A mom told me how her mother and daughter were killed by a car stuffed with 11 illegal immigrants.
Her daughter was 7.
Choking on consequences 
I saw anger on the faces of ranchers and farmers who live and work near the border.
Every day, they watch illegal immigrants cut their fences and run through their fields.
They're spending their hard-earned money repairing the damage that's done every day.
They don't go anywhere without their guns for their own protection.
I also saw anger on the faces of legal immigrants living in the area. They waited their turn to come to our country.
They played by the rules.
Every day, their businesses are hurt and their lives are endangered by those who break the rules.
And as people who hope to become Americans one day, they don't want their new country to be overrun with any more crime and drugs.
Next to the train tracks, where a local sheriff told me the train cars are filled with illegal immigrants waiting to jump off.
A small town, with too many high-speed chases and too few law-enforcement officers.
There's no part of the border region that doesn't deal with this crisis every day.
But I didn't just see the border crisis.
I saw that Americans have the determination to restore the rule of law, protect our families from drugs and crime, and stem the flow of illegal immigrants.
Local law enforcement told me they're doing everything they can, but they aren't getting the support they need.
And federal immigration law enforcement say morale is nonexistent and their job is basically baby-sitting.
Their hands are tied; they've had to catch-and-release when they should catch-and-deport.
When I asked Medina County Sheriff Randy Brown what the number one thing we can do is, he had a simple solution: ""Close the border.""
It's not rocket science.
The only reason we haven't solved the border crisis is because President Biden is not up to the job.
Biden thinks if he doesn't talk about the border crisis, it doesn't exist.
The crime and drugs streaming into our country barely register on his radar.
It took him nearly two years as president just to go to the border.
While he stayed in Washington, millions of people illegally came into the country.
So did millions of fentanyl pills and other deadly drugs.
Biden, like so many in DC, would rather use the border for political gain than solve these urgent and deadly problems.
Families destroyed
Biden's border failure hurts every American.
It hurts our families, who've seen loved ones die from fentanyl overdoses — as many as 70,000 in 2021 alone.
I talked with some of these families in New Hampshire just last week.
The drugs that come across the border soon find their way into every corner of America, even those furthest from the southern border.
Biden's border failure hurts our neighborhoods, which are dealing with unprecedented numbers of illegal immigrants.
It hurts our small businesses, which face unfair competition, and our taxpayers, who pay for handouts for people who shouldn't get a cent.
And yes, President Biden's border failure makes America far less safe.
Last year alone, nearly 100 suspected terrorists were arrested attempting to cross our southern border — about nine times more than during the four years of the last administration.
And less than halfway through this year, it's all but certain that record will be broken.
Securing our borders is essential to national security.
So long as Joe Biden is president, the border crisis will get worse.
Defeating him is the first step to securing our borders, stopping the fentanyl and crime wave, and finally ending illegal immigration.
What I saw at the border Monday should upset every American.
And it should spur us to end this crisis with real leadership.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Campaign Launches 'Women for Nikki' Ahead of Iowa Campaign Stops,2023-03-31T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-campaign-launches-women-for-nikki-ahead-iowa,"
Fox News by Adam Sabes and Jon Street
Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley is launching Women for Nikki ahead of several campaign stops in Iowa in April.
Haley's campaign manager Betsy Ankney told Fox News Digital that the Women for Nikki campaign will be launched in Iowa.
""Team Haley is excited to launch our Women for Nikki campaign in Iowa! There's no shortage of strong women leaders in the Hawkeye State. We're looking forward to working with women in Iowa and all across the country to make Nikki Haley the next president of the United States,"" Ankney told Fox News Digital.
Haley will be joined by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, at multiple campaign stops in Iowa on April 10 and 11, according to a campaign spokesperson.
When visiting Iowa previously, Haley has held town halls with farmers, state legislators and small businesses, the spokesperson said.
Rachel Geilenfeld, co-chair of Iowa's Women for Nikki campaign, told Fox News Digital that Haley has an ""impressive résumé.""
""Nikki is a governor, a job creator, an ambassador, and a tough-as-nails conservative who went toe-to-toe with North Korea, Russia, and China and didn't blink. She is a unifier who can bring people together to get conservative results,"" Geilenfeld said.
Emily Sukup Schmitt, another co-chair of Iowa's Women for Nikki campaign, told Fox News Digital that Haley is a ""principled, gutsy leader who will make America strong and proud.""
""As a working mom, it's high time we had a mom in the White House who will fight for our kids. As a female business leader, I am impressed by Nikki's commitment to cutting spending and tackling inflation. As governor and as U.N. ambassador, Nikki has always done what's right — even if it isn't popular,"" Schmitt said.
Haley launched her 2024 campaign during an event in Charleston, South Carolina, on Feb. 15, telling the audience and viewers across America that ""it's time for a new generation of leadership.""
""America is not past our prime, it's just that our politicians are past theirs,"" Haley said.

Haley Campaign Press Release - 'Leaders Show Up': Nikki Haley To Become First Presidential Candidate To Visit Southern Border,2023-03-31T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-leaders-show-nikki-haley-become-first-presidential-candidate,"
Daily Caller by Michael Ginsberg
Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley will visit the southern border on April 3, her campaign announced Tuesday, making her the first Republican presidential candidate to do so.
Haley will travel alongside Republican Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales to locations between San Antonio and Eagle Pass, all of which are in Gonzales' 23rd District. The 23rd covers the majority of the Texas-Mexico border and includes the heavily trafficked Del Rio sector. U.S. Border Patrol chief Raul Ortiz recently testified at a field hearing that his agency does not have ""operational control"" of the southern border.
""Joe Biden caused the crisis at our southern border with his terrible policies and then ignored it for two years. Leaders show up. That's why Nikki Haley is going to the border,"" Haley campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso told the Daily Caller.
At a Monday town hall in Dover, New Hampshire, Haley outlined her platform on immigration, including mandating E-Verify nationwide, hiring 25,000 new Border Patrol and ICE personnel, and prohibiting sanctuary states and cities from giving taxpayer funds to illegal immigrants. Her campaign previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation that she supports labeling drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.
As governor of South Carolina, Haley signed a law mandating statewide E-Verify and requiring that police officers contact federal officials after arresting illegal immigrants. The Obama administration sued over the law, claiming that it ""interfered with the federal government's enforcement of immigration."" The legislation also made selling fake IDs to illegal immigrants a felony and prohibited transporting illegal immigrants.
House Republicans released an immigration white paper ahead of the 2022 midterms that included nationwide E-Verify, completing the southern border wall, re-implementing the Migrant Protection Protocols and increasing funding for Border Patrol and ICE. Texas Rep. Chip Roy introduced legislation in January that would prohibit migrants from setting foot on U.S. soil if they do not have proper documentation.
Gonzales opposes the legislation. Roy's bill ""does nothing to fix the root causes of the problems at our border,"" Gonzales wrote, but would ""just turn asylum-seekers away."" Gonzales is already facing two primary challengers from the right who argue that he has not done enough to oppose illegal immigration.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Plans to Halt Hiring of Illegal Immigrants with E-Verify Mandate if Elected,2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-plans-halt-hiring-illegal-immigrants-with-e,"
Breitbart by Nick Gilbertson
Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration, detailed her immigration and border security platform on the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Tuesday. The candidate hosted back-to-back town hall events in Dover and Salem.
At both events, Haley highlighted her plans to mandate the E-Verify program on the federal level, hire 25,000 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees, and end ""handouts"" to illegal aliens, her campaign noted.
E-Verify is a government-run tool that allows employers to verify the employment eligibility of their workers. As governor of South Carolina, Haley enacted statewide E-Verify requirements for business on all new hires. The 2011 law, which is still on the books, mandates that employers verify new workers' employment eligibility within three days.
Haley discussed her plans to bring such a program to the national stage while speaking with Breitbart News Washington Bureau chief Matthew Boyle during an exclusive interview following her campaign launch event in February.
""What we did in South Carolina with E-Verify was you had to verify that that person was in this country legally or else you could not hire them,"" Haley said. ""That's what we put in place in South Carolina, and more importantly we enforced it. When you enforce it, one, that stops everybody from coming across the border. Two, it puts laws in place that matter. Americans need to get these jobs. We need Americans building things again. We need Americans working again. We don't need to pay them to sit on the couch. We need to get them to work, but we have to have the jobs ready for them when we get them there.""
On Tuesday, Haley also detailed her vision to reverse plans to hire 87,000 new IRS agents as laid out in the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act boondoggle, which does not actually reduce inflation. Instead, she vows to hire tens of thousands of CBP and ICE employees.
""When I'm president, we're going to stop catch-and-release, and we're going to start catch-and-deport,"" Haley told the audience in Salem, WMUR reported.
Additionally, Haley plans to stop using federal tax dollars to fund handouts for illegal immigrants, including carveouts established by liberal states for illegal migrants through federal pandemic relief funds, as well as billions in federal funds that flow into Democrat-run sanctuary cities.
""Billions of dollars have been paid to illegal immigrants. That's got to stop,"" Haley told WMUR during an interview Tuesday. ""Let's defund sanctuary cities once and for all and make sure we don't go back to that.""
In an op-ed published in the National Review ahead of her events, Haley zoned in on the fentanyl epidemic killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. She asserted that sanctuary cities perpetuate the problem and pointed specifically to Lawrence, Massachusetts, a small city of some 88,000 people just south of the New Hampshire border, as an example:
Lawrence is like a lot of towns in the region. The factories closed a long time ago. Then a new kind of business sprang up: the kind that traffics illegal drugs. In 2018, law enforcement in New Hampshire traced a drug bust to Lawrence, leading to 45 indictments and the seizure of 30 kilograms of fentanyl. It was their largest drug bust at the time. Yet the flow of dangerous and illegal drugs kept coming. No wonder: Lawrence is a sanctuary city that blocks federal immigration law enforcement from doing its job.
New Hampshire families are reeling from fentanyl. More than 400 people have died from drug overdoses in New Hampshire almost every year for the past decade. In 2022, that number was 434 people — and two-thirds died from fentanyl. It's heartbreaking, and it's far from over. Many more men, women, and children have been exposed to this deadly drug. Even now, dealers are pedaling it across the state.
…
The fentanyl that goes through towns such as Lawrence into states such as New Hampshire overwhelmingly comes from China and Mexico. Chemicals are manufactured in China, then sent to Mexico. Mexico mass-produces liquid fentanyl and fentanyl powder that's mixed into fake prescription drugs. Drug cartels push fentanyl across the border and sell their goods to drug traffickers. From there, it makes its way to our families and friends.
Haley is traveling to the Southern border next week with visits to San Antonio and Eagle Pass, Texas, with Rep. Tony Gonzalez (R-TX).

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Blasts Biden for Interfering in Israeli Politics,2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-blasts-biden-for-interfering-israeli-politics,"
Breitbart by Joel B. Pollak
Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley blasted President Joe Biden Wednesday for interfering in Israeli domestic politics, saying the U.S. would never tolerate the same.
Haley was referring to Biden's refusal to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House, as he invited both of Netanyahu's predecessors, in protest at the Israeli government's ongoing judicial reforms.
The Biden administration has backed the opposition's protests against the reforms. Critics on the Israeli right note that Biden appears to be trying to oust Netanyahu at a delicate time, as Iran is nearing a nuclear weapon.
Israel's judiciary, referred to as a ""juristocracy"" by critics, has assumed vast powers in recent decades, including not only the power to overturn legislation but also the power to control the appointment of judges to the bench.
Because most of the judges are left-wing, and from Israel's secular, European elite, many Israelis on the right and from Middle Eastern or African backgrounds have come to resent the court's interference in government.
Netanyahu ran on a promise to reform the judiciary, and some of his proposals parallel U.S. law. In some ways the U.S. has even stronger checks and balances: Congress can eliminate most federal courts, for example.
Biden himself considered sweeping judicial reforms to install a left-wing Supreme Court by ""packing"" the Court with new seats that would be filled by liberal nominees. His White House launched a commission on the topic.
Haley, widely viewed as a strong advocate for the U.S.-Israel relationship during her tenure at the U.S., is the first presidential contender to criticize Biden for his stance against Netanyahu and the Israeli judicial reforms.
Former President Donald Trump has been quiet about the issue. Though he was arguably the most pro-Israel president in U.S. history, he has criticized Netanyahu for acknowledging Biden's victory in the 2022 election.
Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, another Republican contender, has yet to respond to Biden's attacks on Israel, but is due to travel to the region next month.
Haley is therefore the first major contender to comment on the crisis.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - Ending the Fentanyl Crisis Starts by Securing the Border,2023-03-28T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-ending-the-fentanyl-crisis-starts-securing-the-border,"
National Review by Nikki Haley
Today, I will hold a town hall in Salem, N.H. But I'll start by discussing another town, just a few miles to the south. Lawrence, Mass., isn't a place most people know. But for anyone in New England who has lost a loved one to fentanyl, there's a good chance Lawrence played a painful role.
Lawrence is like a lot of towns in the region. The factories closed a long time ago. Then a new kind of business sprang up: the kind that traffics illegal drugs. In 2018, law enforcement in New Hampshire traced a drug bust to Lawrence, leading to 45 indictments and the seizure of 30 kilograms of fentanyl. It was their largest drug bust at the time. Yet the flow of dangerous and illegal drugs kept coming. No wonder: Lawrence is a sanctuary city that blocks federal immigration law enforcement from doing its job.
New Hampshire families are reeling from fentanyl. More than 400 people have died from drug overdoses in New Hampshire almost every year for the past decade. In 2022, that number was 434 people — and two-thirds died from fentanyl. It's heartbreaking, and it's far from over. Many more men, women, and children have been exposed to this deadly drug. Even now, dealers are peddling it across the state.
So many people I've talked to in New Hampshire know someone who died from a fentanyl overdose. And every single one of them knows that if we want to save more mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters from this horrible fate, we have to get the southern border under control.
The fentanyl that goes through towns such as Lawrence into states such as New Hampshire overwhelmingly comes from China and Mexico. Chemicals are manufactured in China, then sent to Mexico. Mexico mass-produces liquid fentanyl and fentanyl powder that's mixed into fake prescription drugs. Drug cartels push fentanyl across the border and sell their goods to drug traffickers. From there, it makes its way to our families and friends.
This is a massive crisis. In 2022, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized 50.6 million fentanyl pills and more than 10,500 pounds of fentanyl powder. That's enough to kill every American.
But that's just what we caught. Huge amounts of fentanyl still made it across the border. It claimed the lives of up to 70,000 Americans in 2021 — a record, and up from almost zero a decade earlier. When the numbers for 2022 come out, the death toll may be even higher. It's not just Salem: From the biggest cities to the smallest towns, dealers are killing more and more Americans with drugs from Mexico and China.
Securing the border is the first and most important step toward ending this crisis. Yet the one person who can do the most to help is actively making things so much worse. President Joe Biden has spent two-plus years in office ignoring the border and undermining proven efforts to stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants. He has abandoned his duty to protect Americans, from Salem to San Diego to everywhere in between.
The list of Biden's offenses is depressingly long. He brought back the disastrous ""catch and release"" policy that lets drug runners go free after illegally crossing the border. He's tried to end ""Title 42"" and ended ""Remain in Mexico,"" making it easier for people carrying drugs to get into America and stay here. Biden still refuses to crack down on ""sanctuary cities"" such as Lawrence.
Biden doesn't seem to know how bad things are at the border. That makes sense, considering it took him nearly two years to go there, even as tens of thousands of Americans died. As president, I will focus on securing the border — and saving Americans' lives — from Day One.
Here's how: I will recruit and hire new Border Patrol and ICE workers to stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigration. I'll restart Remain in Mexico and keep Title 42, while ending catch-and-release once and for all. I'll end sanctuary cities, so that if we don't stop drug runners at the border, we will stop them in places such as Lawrence. More broadly, I'll crack down on illegal immigration by instituting a national E-Verify program — like I did as South Carolina's governor — and end taxpayer-funded handouts to illegal immigrants. Illegal drug-running and illegal immigration go hand in hand, so I'll tackle this crisis from every angle.
While securing the border is the first step to ending the fentanyl crisis, the first step to securing the border is ending Joe Biden's presidency. I will do that, too, so our families are finally safe from the scourge of fentanyl. The good people of New Hampshire are counting on it. So is every American.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley to Visit Southern Border in Texas After Unveiling Plan to Tackle Migrant Crisis,2023-03-28T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-visit-southern-border-texas-after-unveiling-plan,"
Fox News by Adam Shaw
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley will visit the southern border in Texas next week, Fox News Digital has learned — as the former governor is unveiling her plan to handle the ongoing migrant crisis now into its third year.
Haley will become the first presidential candidate to visit the border when she travels to Texas on April 3. She will be accompanied by Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, and will make several stops between San Antonio and Eagle Pass. The area has seen some of the heaviest migrant traffic along the border in recent years as authorities have been besieged by the historic crisis.
There were over 1.7 million encounters at the southern border in FY 2021, and more than 2.3 million in FY 2022. FY 2023 has been on pace to eclipse those numbers, although numbers have dipped in January and February.
Republicans have attributed the crisis to the policies of the Biden administration — specifically the rolling back of Trump-era border protections, and an increase in ""catch-and-release"" of migrants into the U.S. The White House has attributed the crisis to a hemisphere-wide challenge and has called on Republicans to provide additional funding.
Haley, who is a daughter of legal immigrants, has been rolling out her plan to secure the border and tackle illegal immigration. That plan would see the recent funding for up to 87,000 IRS staff scrapped in favor of 25,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
The plan would also mandate that businesses use E-Verify — which verifies a worker's citizenship and immigration status — in their hiring processes. As governor of South Carolina, Haley had signed a bill requiring all businesses in the state to use the tool.
Additionally, a Haley administration would cut funding to states that have been used to give money to illegal immigrants — such as the billions used by New York to cut checks to illegal immigrant workers who lost their jobs during the pandemic.
Her plan would also restore the Trump-era ""Remain-in-Mexico"" policy — which kept migrants in Mexico while their immigration hearings proceeded, instead of releasing them into the U.S. Republicans have credited that policy with reducing the pull factors which drew migrants north. Haley is also promising to end the ""catch-and-release"" practices of the Biden administration.
""We fix [the border crisis] by going back to Remain-in-Mexico, we fix it by stopping catch and release, we fix it by putting up an actual wall and closing our border,"" she said earlier this month on ""One Nation with Brian Kilmeade.""
""But we do it by doing what I did in South Carolina as governor,"" she said. ""We did a mandatory E-Verify program that said none of our businesses could hire anyone that was in this country illegally. That is what got them out of South Carolina because there were no jobs for them to come to, that's what will get them out of this country, we've got to make sure none of our businesses hire anyone that is here in the country illegally, and we've got to start taking this seriously. Every state is a border state.""
In addition to mandating E-Verify, the legislation she signed as governor also required police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop who they suspected may be in the U.S. illegally — following similar legislation in states like Arizona.
That bill also created an illegal immigration enforcement unit, made it illegal to transport or harbor illegal immigrants, made it a felony to sell fake IDs to illegal immigrants and barred illegal immigrants from state or local benefits. The bill faced significant pushback from immigration activists.
""Illegal immigration is not welcome in South Carolina,"" Haley said in 2011 when she signed the bill.
As governor, she also declined to accept Syrian refugees over concerns about vetting, and in 2014 said that South Carolina would not be accepting illegal immigrant minors in order to focus on children already in the state. When she served as U.N. ambassador during the Trump administration, the U.S. withdrew from the global compact on migration in part due to concerns that it would have restricted U.S. policy and impinged on U.S. sovereignty.
Illegal immigration and border security are likely to remain top topics in both the Republican primary season and the 2024 general election.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - China Wins if Russia Conquers Ukraine,2023-03-21T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-china-wins-if-russia-conquers-ukraine,"
Wall Street Journal by Nikki Haley
This week's meeting in Moscow between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin is the latest proof that China is Russia's best friend and biggest backer. Everyone knows it, yet President Biden and some Republicans are failing to realize a corresponding truth: If Russia wins in Ukraine, China wins too.
Beijing has set its sights on overtaking the U.S. militarily, economically and culturally. Mr. Xi is in Moscow because supporting Mr. Putin advances his dark vision. He wants Russia to conquer Ukraine so it's easier for China to invade Taiwan. He wants Russia to threaten the rest of Europe because it draws America's attention from Asia.
Why are many American politicians blind to this? Why don't they want Ukraine to beat China's ally? Victory for Kyiv would make the U.S. safer without putting a single American soldier in harm's way.
Mr. Biden says the U.S. stands with Ukraine, but he has consistently let Russia seize the initiative. He encouraged the invasion by surrendering in Afghanistan and by saying a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine would be OK. He has failed to send Kyiv the support it needs, when it needs it. He has even given Ukraine money without accountability when he should have sent weapons and military equipment. Ukrainians clearly have the will to win. But Mr. Biden has given Ukraine only enough to slow the Russian advance, not to repel it.
Mr. Biden's hemming and hawing is consistent with his history on national security. More surprising is the weakness from some on the right. They say the U.S. shouldn't care about Ukraine because this war isn't our fight. Some call it a mere ""territorial dispute."" They say we should ignore Ukraine so we can focus on China.
This has it backward. China loses if Ukraine wins. Nobody knows that better than Mr. Xi. He wants America to shift attention from Ukraine in the short run, because it would give Russia and China an edge in the long run—in Europe, Asia and world-wide. Yet the U.S. can stifle China's ambitions now by helping Ukraine, and we can do it without sending a blank check or risking American troops.
There are many things we must do to counter China on technology, trade and intelligence. But it's naive to think we can counter China by ignoring Russia. It's a dangerous world, and backing away from support for Ukraine would embolden those looking to harm U.S. interests. Beyond China, Iran and North Korea would see a Ukrainian loss as an invitation to evil. Israel, South Korea and Japan would be at much greater risk—and so would the American people. Our enemies threaten our friends because, ultimately, they want to defeat and destroy us.
As ambassador to the United Nations, I saw that when America stands strong, our enemies step back. We need to stand strong with our friends in Kyiv, not least because their victory over Russia would have effects extending far beyond Ukraine. Messrs. Xi and Putin know it, which is why they're meeting in Moscow this week. The U.S. needs a leader who knows it too, and does what needs to be done to protect the American people and the freedom we hold dear.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Hits Biden Over Silicon Valley Bank,2023-03-16T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-hits-biden-over-silicon-valley-bank,"
Newsmax by Theodore Bunker
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley criticized President Joe Biden on Monday for what she called a ""bailout"" for Silicon Valley Bank following its recent collapse.
Biden said in a speech on Monday that taxpayers won't suffer ""losses"" due to the bank's collapse, noting that the money would be covered by the Deposit Insurance Fund which is paid into by banks.
""Joe Biden is pretending this isn't a bailout,"" Haley tweeted following Biden's speech. ""It is.""
She added, ""Now depositors at healthy banks are forced to subsidize Silicon Valley Bank's mismanagement. When the Deposit Insurance Fund runs dry, all bank customers are on the hook. That's a public bailout.""
Haley continued, ""Depositors should be paid by selling off Silicon Valley Bank's assets, not by the public. Taxpayers should not be responsible.""

Des Moines Register by Brianne Pfannenstiel and Francesca Block
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley told Iowans Friday morning that America needs to be tougher on the world stage and make national security one of the country's top priorities.
""I think America right now looks so distracted, and when America is distracted, the world is less safe,"" Haley said to a crowd of Iowans in Clive.
Haley joined U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst for a discussion on foreign policy hosted by The Bastion Institute, positioning herself as the authority on foreign policy among an increasingly crowded field of potential Republican presidential candidates.
Her trip came as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made his Iowa debut Friday ahead of the 2024 presidential caucuses and a possible campaign.
Haley flexed her experience as ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump Administration to make a case for her vision of U.S. leadership on the world stage, arguing that America needs to act as a global leader in promoting fundamental values of human rights and freedom.
That means, Haley said, strengthening the U.S. military by promoting patriotism and technological innovation, and focusing less on diversity, equity and inclusion's ""gender pronoun classes.""
She said U.S. leadership also requires being tougher on adversaries such as China, Russia and Iran, and showing support for its allies, including Ukraine, even as other Republicans have publicly questioned America's financial support to the country at war with Russia.
""I wanted to make sure that every country knew what America was for and what we were against,"" she said. ""I didn't care if they didn't like me, but I wanted them to respect America.""
She said it's imperative the U.S. join with its allies ""to make sure that they (Ukraine) have the equipment they need.""
""If we win this war, this will send a message to China, it'll send a message to Iran, it will send a message to Korea, it'll send a message to Russia. If we lose this war, we need to take dictators at their word. They said Poland and the Baltics are next and you're looking at a world war,"" she said of Hitler's invasion that presaged World War II. ""This isn't about starting a war, this is about preventing one.""
Haley also noted her track record on promoting U.S. interests abroad. As UN ambassador, Haley made headlines for leading America's withdrawal from the Human Rights Council and for her staunch support of Israel while the country faced allegations from the international community of human rights abuses.
On Friday, Haley called the U.N. ""a farce."" Haley said she intentionally went into the role keen on disrupting the status quo and making sure America's interests were front and center.
Haley makes Iowa trip as Iowa Poll says many Iowans still don't know her
The foreign policy forum came at the end of Haley's three-day trip across the first-in-the-nation caucus state, which began with a public town hall in Council Bluffs Wednesday night.
She also met privately with farmers, stopped for pastries at a Winterset Bakery, spoke to Iowa lawmakers at the Capitol in Des Moines and held a town hall in Nevada Thursday evening.
Her visit comes as a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows Haley is viewed favorably by 53% of Iowa Republicans and unfavorably by 8%. However, she is relatively unknown, with 40% saying they don't know enough about her to form an opinion.
The poll of 257 self-identified Republicans in Iowa, conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, has a margin of error of plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.
At an event in Nevada Thursday night, Haley urged Iowans not to read too much into early polling, saying she won her race for governor despite being mostly unknown.
""I don't mind being underestimated,"" she said. ""It makes me good. It makes me scrappy. It motivates me. What I want to know is that you'll have the courage too to say, 'Maybe we deserve better. Maybe we're not going to listen to the pundits and we're not going to listen to the politicos telling us what we should be thinking.'""
Even if they didn't know much about her before, attendees at Friday's foreign policy discussion were eager to hear her as they begin to weigh potential candidates for 2024.
""I've only heard Ambassador Haley speak once before, but I'm interested in hearing more about what she thinks,"" Clive resident Kim Schmett said ahead of the event.
Schmett said Haley has a track record that makes her a strong potential candidate. He voted for Trump in 2020, but said he's unlikely to vote for the former president again.
""I'm interested in seeing several candidates on the campaign trail. I certainly think she's got a lot of credibility,"" he said.
John Bandstra, 66, of Oskaloosa said Haley impressed him with her knowledge and experience promoting American interests abroad.
""She said nothing wrong,"" he said.
Bandstra said he particularly appreciated Haley's ""America first"" position. Echoing Trump, now her political opponent, Haley told Iowans Friday America needs to ""build a wall"" along the southern border.
""I think we have some good candidates. Nikki is one of them. There's others that have not announced yet that are likely and there's still some in the woodworks,"" he said.
Haley pitches for a ""new generation"" of Republican leadership
In Nevada, about 150 people braved snowy conditions to hear her speak at LongView Farms. She made her pitch for a ""new generation"" of leadership that is less divisive — a not-so-subtle critique of the former president, though she did not mention Trump by name.
""(Republicans) have lost the last seven out of eight popular votes for president,"" Haley said. ""That means we are doing something wrong. We should not be proud of that.""
She said Republican policies are the right ones because they ""lift up everybody, not just a select few.""
""But the way we communicate matters,"" she said, arguing that Republicans need to be better about bringing women, racial minorities and others into the party.
Tammy Wicks, a Hubbard resident who attended the event in Nevada, said afterward that Haley had won her over with her speech.
""I've been a Trump follower. I voted for Trump. We met Trump when he first started his campaign up in Mason City,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, lately, I just — my faith has faltered. He has so much drama and turmoil around him, and he just doesn't know when to close his mouth.""
Wicks said she appreciated that Haley spoke about creating more competition in health care, supporting the ethanol industry, making changes to preserve the future of Social Security and putting parents in charge of their kids' education.
""I feel good putting my faith in her,"" Wicks said, sporting a Nikki Haley button and holding a yard sign.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Will Make Republicans the Party of Fiscal Sanity Again,2023-03-09T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-will-make-republicans-the-party-fiscal-sanity,"
Townhall by Cesar Conda
In 2008, a little-known state representative who was never supposed to win her race in the first place set her sights on slaying another goliath: the culture of secrecy and cronyism in South Carolina government.?
Then-State Rep. Nikki Haley was disgusted when a majority of the State House members voted to give themselves a retirement pay raise—by voice vote. Taxpayers couldn't look up how their representatives voted. No one could. Because the vast majority of votes in the South Carolina legislature were not recorded.
So Haley introduced a bill to put legislative votes on the record. Her goal was simple: Open up legislative activity to the light of day. Allow taxpayers to see how their money is being spent and hold their representatives accountable. Simple, yes—but not easy.
Her Republican colleagues tried to shut her down, even punishing her boldness by taking away plum committee assignments. Instead of backing down, Haley traveled the state, urging voters to call their representatives and tell them to sponsor her bill. She ran for governor on a transparency platform and won—beating the Republican establishment and the political odds again. The legislation putting votes on the record was one of the first bills she signed—three years after she launched her initial mission.?
Fifteen years later, now-presidential candidate Haley is targeting big-spending Washington Republicans again with a fiery promise: ""I don't care if it's Republicans or Democrats who send me pork-filled, trillion-dollar spending bills… I'll veto every single one of 'em.""
In a speech before Club for Growth donors and in a USA Today op-ed, Haley lambasted both parties for contributing to the spending crisis in this country: ""Here's the truth. Lots of Republican politicians love spending and wasting taxpayer money almost as much as Democrats.""?
She criticized Washington Republicans for growing the national debt, bringing back earmarks, growing no-strings-attached welfare programs, rubber stamping corporate bailouts and handouts, and starting the country's record-breaking Covid spending.
She has a point. Republicans got the ball rolling on the trillion-dollar pandemic blowouts, and Democrats took the ball and ran to the endzone.? And after a decade of swearing off earmarks, Republicans decided to bring back earmarks. It's disingenuous for Republicans to rail against Biden's socialist takeover when their hands are still stuck in the cookie jar.?
Haley is also right about another thing. Stopping the spending addiction has to come from the top. One fiscally conservative senator or representative can only do so much. Republicans will need a strong-minded, thick-skinned fiscal conservative in the White House if we have any hope of getting federal spending under control and reversing the Democrats' march towards socialism.?
Even so, that lucky Republican will face headwinds from her (or his) own colleagues. For all of President Trump's talk about draining the swamp, Washington D.C. is as swampy as ever. There is little short-term incentive to cut spending and many incentives to keep the spigots flowing.?
According to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to double to 200 percent in 30 years. Net spending on interest will increase substantially, from $475 billion in 2022 to $1.4 trillion in 2033, the CBO projects. America has a national spending and debt crisis, yet official Washington has ignored it for years.
Is Haley up for the job? Her early start in politics is a useful guide. From her time in the South Carolina legislature to the governor's mansion to the United Nations, Haley seems to relish the David vs. Goliath fights. The normal carrots and sticks of politics— committee assignments and access to power—don't phase her. In fact, it seems like the best way to get her to do something is to tell her it can't be done.?
Tell her she can't beat a 30-year incumbent.?
Tell her she can't put votes on the record in South Carolina or pass ethics reform.?
Tell her she can't convince China and Russia to sign onto the biggest set of sanctions on North Korea ever.?
Tell her America can't withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council.?
Tell her she can't win the race for president and reverse Washington's spending catastrophe.
Tell her she can't do any of these things, and she works ten times harder to get it done.?
Haley likes to remind her naysayers that ""she's never lost a race and she doesn't plan on starting now."" This race and this challenge will be her biggest one yet. But there's a reason people warn not to underestimate Nikki Haley.?
I, for one, am not counting her out and hope that whichever Republican wins will have the courage to make the GOP the party of fiscal sanity once again.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - Spending is Out of Control. And Democrats and Republicans Share the Blame.,2023-03-07T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-spending-out-control-and-democrats-and-republicans-share-the-blame,"
USA Today by Nikki Haley
The current push to raise the federal debt limit is depressing. Worse is the fact that this same fiasco will keep happening. Washington simply isn't serious about getting spending under control.
We must be honest: Both Democrats and Republicans are responsible for America's spending crisis. They have both supported multitrillion dollar deficits that have brought us to a $31.6 trillion national debt and counting.
The nonstop spending binge of the past three years also gave us the soaring inflation that's still squeezing families and an economy that's stumbling toward recession.
We need a president who will do what no one has done to date: Stand up to the big spenders in both parties.
Return of earmarks was bad news for taxpayersLook no further than the bipartisan and boneheaded decision to bring back earmarks in 2021. They're the gateway drug to higher spending, persuading lawmakers to vote for unaffordable trillion dollar bills because, hey, at least they got a cut. Congress has already passed $15.3 billion in earmarks and counting in fiscal year 2023, greasing the skids for ever-more-unaffordable spending blowouts.
Then there's welfare. Three years ago, Democrats and Republicans in Congress united to change Medicaid rules, adding tens of millions more people while dramatically expanding food stamps – with no strings attached. We should be saving taxpayer money by moving people from welfare to work, not the other way around.
Welfare state grew under COVID-19: Who will pay for this reckless spending? Your children will for decades.
Republicans and Democrats also love giving the American people's money to politically connected companies. They came together to hand tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to chip makers, which now have to do the Biden administration's far-left bidding on everything from child care to union pay rates.
Infrastructure bill was packed with corporate welfareTheir bipartisan ""infrastructure"" bill was chock full of corporate welfare, too, including billions on electric chargers for cars Americans can't afford.
Every special-interest bailout, handout and carve-out that Washington politicians create pads a lucky few pockets while picking everyone else's.
Give it up, Joe: From student loans to masks, why does Biden want to keep us in a perpetual 'emergency'?
Republicans deserve to be called out for getting the ball rolling on the pandemic spending binge. Democrats deserve blame for keeping it going, price tag be damned. They've taken the famous line, ""Never let a crisis go to waste,"" to a whole new level, throwing billions of dollars at everything from labor unions to government entities that don't exist.
And with President Joe Biden set to unveil his latest budget on Thursday, you can bet Democrats will continue to push for even more spending that Americans don't need and can't afford.
Chances are slim that Democrats and Republicans get serious about spending at any point between now and the election in November 2024. By then, Washington will have spent another $11 trillion while driving the national debt even higher. The American people are counting on the next president to get spending under control.
As president, I will veto spending bills that don't put America on track to reach pre-pandemic spending levels. I will claw back the $500 billion in federal pandemic funding that hasn't been spent while going after up to $100 billion or more lost to fraud.
These fights will inevitably pit me against Republicans as well as Democrats, but I'm used to it. As governor of South Carolina, I took on both parties to stop wasteful spending and to put every spending vote on the record, a fundamental measure of accountability and protecting taxpayers. I won that fight.
It's time someone in Washington stood up for taxpayers and stopped America's slide toward bankruptcy.

"Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - As President, I'll Make America More Like Iowa",2023-03-01T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-president-ill-make-america-more-like-iowa,"
Nikki Haley by The Gazette
America needs to be more like Iowa.
That's my main takeaway after spending time this week holding town halls across the state – my first visit since declaring my candidacy for President earlier this month. Iowa is strong and proud, with conservative leadership all the way. But under Joe Biden and the Democrats, strength and pride are afterthoughts at best. And based on their decision to ditch the state's first-in-the-nation caucus, this President is ignoring Iowa entirely.
Iowa deserves better. And Iowans know we can do better.
That fact was clear in my conversations with countless residents from Des Moines to Urbandale to Cedar Rapids to Marion. They look at what's happening to America, and it deeply worries them. They see family-owned farms and small businesses being destroyed by the heavy hand of government and bailouts for big businesses. They see veterans struggling to obtain the benefits they earned in the uniform of the United States. And they see their country losing faith in itself, with children learning to hate, not love, the greatest nation in human history.
This should worry them. It worries me, too. That's why I'm running for President.
My purpose is to stop America's downward spiral. I aim to move us forward toward freedom and self-confidence – toward the same strength and pride that defines the Hawkeye State.
Why is Iowa so strong and proud? To start, this is a state that values work over welfare. You can see it in the can-do spirit that defines Iowa farmers and entrepreneurs. I saw the same thing in South Carolina during my time as governor when we moved 20,000 people from welfare to work. We need to do that for tens of millions of our fellow Americans. And we need to stop the Biden administration's new land-grab water mandate, which threatens farmers across this state.
Iowa is strong and proud because of its education leadership. When Gov. Kim Reynolds signed education savings accounts into law earlier this year, she gave families the freedom to choose the school that's right for their children. I fought for that same freedom as governor, and I'll deliver it nationwide as President. And I'll make sure no politician can close our schools ever again.
Iowa's strength and pride spring from many sources. This is a state that backs the blue, putting the police and safe streets ahead of criminals and chaos. It believes in defending religious liberty and the lives of the unborn. Families here believe in military service, which matters to me, as the wife of a combat veteran. And Iowans know we have to secure our border and stop the flow of dangerous drugs like fentanyl. The lives of our children, and the survival of our nation, depend on it.
The values that sustain Iowa are the bedrock of America. Yet President Biden is hard at work undermining them. He's weakening our country – economically, culturally, and spiritually – at the exact moment we need to be strong. And he's destroying the pride that inspires each generation to defend our freedom, which is an urgent necessity in the face of Communist China. President Biden and his party have even spread the lie that America is racist. Take it from me, the first minority female governor in history: America is not a racist country.
As President, I will bring back our country's strength and pride, building on the success that I see in Iowa and that I saw as governor of South Carolina. I'll be back again soon, and I look forward to talking with even more Iowans about your lives and your worries. But I also look forward to hearing your hopes. Iowa is proof that America's best days are ahead of us, and I look forward to proving it together with you.
Nikki Haley is running for president. She was Governor of South Carolina and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

Op-Ed by Nikki Haley - I'll Cut the Billions in Foreign Aid We Send Our Enemies,2023-02-25T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/op-ed-nikki-haley-ill-cut-the-billions-foreign-aid-we-send-our-enemies,"
New York Post by Nikki Haley
America spent $46 billion on foreign aid last year. That's more than any other country by far. Taxpayers deserve to know where that money is going and what it's doing. They will be shocked to find that much of it goes to fund anti-American countries and causes. As president, I'll put a stop to this fiasco.
Here are just a few examples.
We've given Iraq more than $1 billion over the last few years, even though its government is getting closer to the murderous thugs in Iran who shout ""Death to America!"" and launch attacks on our troops.
The Biden administration resumed military aid to Pakistan, though it's home to at least a dozen terrorist organizations and its government is deeply in hock to China.
Team Biden restored half a billion dollars to a corrupt United Nations agency that's supposed to help the Palestinian people but in fact covers for deeply anti-Semitic propaganda against our ally Israel.
We give hundreds of millions of dollars to Zimbabwe, a country with one of the most anti-American voting records in the UN.
If those examples aren't bad enough, it gets worse — almost comical if it weren't true.
American taxpayers still give money to Communist China for ridiculous environment programs, despite the obvious threat China poses to Americans. We give money to Belarus, which is Russian dictator Vladimir Putin's closest ally. We even give money to Communist Cuba — a country our own government has designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.
This is not just Joe Biden. It's been happening for decades under presidents of both parties. Our foreign-aid policies are stuck in the past. They typically operate on autopilot, with no consideration for the conduct of the countries that receive our aid. The Washington bureaucracy and its defenders in Congress inevitably dig in to save these global giveaways. It will take a determined president to root out these taxpayer rip-offs.
I am running for president to restore our nation's strength, our national pride and our people's trust. Backing American allies and friends like Israel and Ukraine is smart. Sending our tax dollars to enemies isn't.
That's why I will cut every cent in foreign aid for countries that hate us. A strong America doesn't pay off the bad guys. A proud America doesn't waste our people's hard-earned money. And the only leaders who deserve our trust are those who stand up to our enemies and stand beside our friends.
I will be that president, just as I was that ambassador.
As US ambassador to the United Nations, I saw how often anti-American countries bashed us in public then privately begged us for money. And I lost confidence in our leaders, who know what's happening but keep letting our enemies pig out at the taxpayer trough. Year after year, Congress throws billions of dollars at our enemies and their allies, instead of focusing on America's allies and our interests.
As ambassador, I strongly supported President Donald Trump's decision to cut nearly $2 billion of military aid to Pakistan because that country supports terrorists who kill American troops. It was a major victory for our troops, our taxpayers and our vital interests, but it didn't go nearly far enough. We've still given them way too much in other aid. As president, I will block every penny.

The Hill by Niall Stanage
Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley this week became the second major Republican candidate for president in 2024, joining former President Trump in a field that is sure to grow.
Other potential candidates, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, are hinting that they could also declare soon.
Enormous speculation is swirling around Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as Trump's most serious rival within the GOP and is reportedly beginning to staff up for a presidential bid.
With the race heating up, where do the contenders stand?
Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley this week became the second major Republican candidate for president in 2024, joining former President Trump in a field that is sure to grow.
Other potential candidates, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, are hinting that they could also declare soon.
Enormous speculation is swirling around Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as Trump's most serious rival within the GOP and is reportedly beginning to staff up for a presidential bid.
With the race heating up, where do the contenders stand?
1. Former President Trump
In The Hill's most recent previous rankings, in early January, Trump had dropped to second place behind DeSantis.
Back then, he was suffering through an especially bad period that had begun with poor performances by his endorsees in November's midterms and was followed by a lackluster campaign launch.
Trump's position has stabilized since then. In the polls, he is still the candidate to beat.
In addition, Haley's entry underscores the possibility of a large field of contenders — something that would help Trump enormously. Trump reacted to Haley's announcement by telling Fox Digital ""the more the merrier"" — which is certainly true, as a political reality, for him.
Trump does face significant challenges, including the lingering fear among some Republicans that he is an electoral drag on the party.
Then there are the numerous legal threats, including special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into events around Jan. 6., 2021, and Trump's possession of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.
Trump got an unexpected assist on the classified documents when President Biden and Pence both got caught in possession of broadly similar information — though they cooperated far more promptly with authorities in returning those documents than Trump did.
Still, the facts remain stark. Trump leads in virtually every poll, he can raise money with ease and his base is as fervent as ever.
2. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis
If DeSantis were able to get Trump in a one-on-one electoral battle, he could very plausibly beat the former president.
Even in a multicandidate field, he is by far the biggest threat to Trump — a reality backhandedly revealed by Team Trump's growing attacks on him.
DeSantis has enormous appeal to the GOP base. Many Republican voters are enthused about his combative approach to liberals and the media, his eager embrace of ""culture war"" issues and his perceived ability to move his political agenda forward with none of Trump's self-defeating chaos.
Critics say DeSantis has not yet proven he can take a punch.
But if he enters the race, it will be the start of an epic battle.
3. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley
Haley had a near-flawless rollout to her campaign this week, announcing her candidacy with a slick video, holding her first event at a well-attended rally in her native South Carolina the next day and bathing in media attention.
Haley even got an unintentional assist from CNN, where 56-year-old anchor Don Lemon made comments that sparked outage about the 51-year-old former South Carolina governor being past her ""prime."" Lemon later expressed regret about his ""inartful"" language.
Haley, unlike many other potential rivals to Trump and DeSantis, has a distinctive appeal.
The daughter of Indian immigrants and a candidate who would become the first female presidential nominee in her party's history if she won, she hopes to expand the GOP's appeal.
In her launch video, she noted that Republicans had lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections.
But Haley is also distrusted by the Trump wing of the party — and it's far from clear that the primary electorate of today's GOP would prefer her more modulated political approach over his.
4. Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas)
Whether he will do so is much more doubtful, however. One key complication is that Cruz is up for reelection to the Senate in 2024.
Cruz could choose to try to secure another six-year term in the Senate, while keeping his powder dry for a future presidential race.
Cruz, at 52, is almost a quarter-century younger than Trump, so he has time on his side.
Still, the presidential bug doesn't easily leave ambitious figures like Cruz alone.
If he gets in the race, he will hope his deep conservatism and taste for political combat will power him past both Trump and DeSantis.
5. Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.)
Scott is one of the most intriguing potential candidates for the GOP in 2024.
His low-key, affable demeanor has led Beltway pundits to underplay the chances of him even launching a White House run.
But he is certainly making a lot of moves that follow the template for any would-be candidate. Just this week, he added a second stop to a scheduled trip to Iowa later in the month.
The Wall Street Journal, citing ""people familiar with his plans,"" reported on Feb. 13 that Scott was ""taking steps to run for president."" And he has recently bolstered the leadership of his super PAC.
Scott, the sole Black Republican senator, has at times been critical of Trump, especially on racial matters, without ever definitively breaking with the former president.
Scott has a conservative voting record, a compelling personal story and at least some history of trying to work across the aisle — he and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) devoted many months to a search for bipartisan police reform, though it was unsuccessful in the end.
6. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin
A presidential run would be an enormous undertaking for Youngkin, who only began his political career in 2021.
But his victory in Virginia's gubernatorial race that year laid down a roadmap for Republican politicians in competitive states.
Youngkin placed enormous emphasis on education — specifically, the right of parents to be more involved in decisionmaking, including around the academic curriculum.
The issue has become a rallying cry for the GOP.
Youngkin was also politically nimble, neither entirely embracing nor disavowing Trump.
In the end, he beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a state Biden had carried by 10 points just 12 months previously.
There are real doubts that Youngkin will jump into the race, however. He has made few moves to suggest a bid is imminent.
7. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott
Abbott, beginning his third term as governor of a huge state, should be a serious contender.
Abbott is perhaps best known nationally for his tough stances on migration, though critics to his left accuse him of ""stunts"" for his deployment of the Texas National Guard to the border and his tactic of transporting migrants to other states.
Abbott is often underrated politically. His reelection victory in November saw him dispatching one-time Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke with ease.
The problem for Abbott, if he runs, is DeSantis.
The Florida governor has a very similar approach and agenda — and he has drawn far more support to his side.
8. Former Vice President Mike Pence
Pence has been very public about the fact that he is mulling a run. Just this week, he traveled to Iowa, where he held a rally focused on parents' rights in Cedar Rapids.
Pence has deep roots among Christian conservatives, and the Iowa caucuses would be critical for him.
He has a clear vulnerability, however. In opinion polls, he has notably higher disapproval ratings among Republican voters than most other potential GOP contenders.
Those numbers are surely a legacy of Pence's refusal to back Trump's illegal plan to overturn the 2020 election, and his subsequent criticism of the former president.
But, as a fact of political life, that history makes it hard to see a realistic path for him to become the GOP's 2024 nominee.
9. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
Pompeo told The Hill in a video interview earlier this week that he was not yet leaning one way or another as he and his family mull a presidential bid.
""There's no lean,"" he said. ""It's kind of binary. It's a zero or one.""
In the same interview, Pompeo promised a substantive campaign in which, he said, ""We'll go make arguments. It's not about tweets, it's not about noise, it's not about 'owning the libs.' It's about presenting a rational argument about how to get our government to function.""
Pompeo has a hard-hitter's resume. Prior to being Trump's secretary of State, he was director of the CIA. Before that, he served three full terms representing Kansas's 4th Congressional District in the House.
The problem for Pompeo, if he goes ahead with a campaign, will be how to distinguish himself from other candidates.
It's simply not clear what his unique selling point is.
10. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem
Many campaign cycles throw up a dark-horse candidate who unexpectedly gathers momentum.
Noem could end up filling that role in 2024.
She is closely in sync with the MAGA wing of the party, in part due to her early and vigorous opposition to coronavirus-related mandates. This week, she told the libertarian Cato Institute that states that pursued more restrictive polices had been engaged in a ""power grab that frankly in this country should be alarming to us.""
Noem is an accomplished media performer. And, for Republican voters who find the idea of a female nominee particularly appealing, she is more of a firebrand than Haley.
She suffers somewhat because her home state is so far removed from major media markets — and from the cities where most big GOP donors are based.
But she is adept at gaining national attention. In recent months, she became one of the first and most prominent GOP critics of TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app that is the focus of numerous fears regarding data privacy and national security.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Trump Backs Nikki Haley's Call for Pols Over 75 to Face Fitness Tests,2023-02-23T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-trump-backs-nikki-haleys-call-for-pols-over-75-face-fitness,"
New York Post by Mark Moore
?Former President Donald Trump came out Tuesday in support of Republican rival Nikki Haley's proposal for mental competency tests for politicians 75 and older, adding that presidential candidates should also be tested on their physical abilities.
""ANYBODY running for the Office of President of the United States should agree to take a full & complete Mental Competency Test simultaneously (or before!) with the announcement that he or she is running, & likewise, but to a somewhat lesser extent, agree to a test which would prove that you are physically capable of doing the job?,"" Trump, 76, said on his Truth Social messaging platform.?
""?Being an outstanding President requires great mental acuity & physical stamina. If you don't have these qualities or traits, it is likely you won't succeed. MAGA!?"" he continued.
Trump famously touted acing a cognitive test when he was president, telling Fox News in a 2020 interview that he stunned the doctors with his memory.
The exam consisted of repeating five words in precise order — person, woman, man, camera, TV — after a short delay.
""And you go: 'Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.' If you get it in order, you get extra points,"" Trump said at the time. ""They said nobody gets it in order. It's actually not that easy, but for me, it was easy.""
He also suggested that then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden should take the same test.
""Joe should take that test because something is going on, and I say this with respect,"" Trump said. ""I mean, [it's] going to probably happen to all of us, right? You know, it's going to happen. But we can't take a chance of it happening.""
Haley, 51, the former US ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, called for a new generation of leaders when she announced her presidential bid last week in South Carolina, saying lawmakers should be subject to term limits and those 75 and older should have to prove their mental fitness.
""We're ready,"" ?said Haley, also the former governor of South Carolina. ""Ready to move past the stale ideas and faded names of the past. And we are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into the future.""
So far, she is the only Republican who has formally announced that they will challenge Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.
Trump launched his third bid for the White House Nov. 15, a week after the midterm elections.
Haley's call for mental competency tests was widely seen as a jab at Trump and Biden, who at 80 is the country's oldest-ever president.
""When America is distracted, the world is less safe? ?—? ?and today, our enemies think the American era has passed. They're wrong. America is not past our prime. It's just that our politicians are past theirs?,"" Haley said at her campaign kickoff.
Republicans have long criticized Biden for his many verbal gaffes and have called on him to take a cognitive test. ?
Biden got a clean bill of health last week after his annual physical, but his doctor didn't say whether he examined the president's mental acuity.

Fox News by Kelly Laco
EXCLUSIVE: Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has secured the endorsement of a top Trump ally, House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Ralph Norman, for her first South Carolina delegation show of support as she launches her 2024 run for president.
Ralph Norman is the first South Carolina lawmaker to publicly back Haley's bid for presidency. His support comes despite former President Donald Trump's endorsement of his re-election the 2022 midterm elections and also after Norman did not vote to certify the 2020 election, in a nod to his loyalty to Trump.
Norman addressed the elephant in the room, saying that the Republican Party is looking for a ""new vision"" at the top of the ticket.
""In 2016, President Trump was exactly who the Republican Party needed at the time. For too long, Republicans had been marginalized. Then Trump came along and reminded us how to fight what we believe. We are better off now for what President Trump accomplished while he was president,"" Norman told Fox News Digital.
""However, the Republican Party has entered a season of change. We're at a pivotal juncture, and most of the Republicans I know are now looking for new leadership with a new vision at the top of the ticket. Nikki Haley has that vision, and she's going to be an outstanding President,"" Norman continued.
Norman's endorsement comes as another top South Carolina Republican, Sen. Tim Scott, is expected to also join the 2024 presidential race.
Haley and Norman were elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 2004 and Norman was the first public official to endorse her 2010 run for governor.
""You always know exactly where Nikki stands. From her time in the statehouse and as governor, there was never a shred of doubt she would do what she believed was right for the people she served,"" Norman added.
""Even as governor, everyone knew she was destined for bigger things,"" he told Fox News Digital.
Haley announced Tuesday that she is running for president, seeking the Republican nomination for the 2024 election.
In a video message posted on Twitter, Haley touted her record as South Carolina's governor, while looking to the future and the needs of the country.
Her official announcement is expected Wednesday in Charleston, South Carolina.

Still, the presidential bug doesn't easily leave ambitious figures like Cruz alone.
If he gets in the race, he will hope his deep conservatism and taste for political combat will power him past both Trump and DeSantis.
5. Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.)
Scott is one of the most intriguing potential candidates for the GOP in 2024.
His low-key, affable demeanor has led Beltway pundits to underplay the chances of him even launching a White House run.
But he is certainly making a lot of moves that follow the template for any would-be candidate. Just this week, he added a second stop to a scheduled trip to Iowa later in the month.
The Wall Street Journal, citing ""people familiar with his plans,"" reported on Feb. 13 that Scott was ""taking steps to run for president."" And he has recently bolstered the leadership of his super PAC.
Scott, the sole Black Republican senator, has at times been critical of Trump, especially on racial matters, without ever definitively breaking with the former president.
Scott has a conservative voting record, a compelling personal story and at least some history of trying to work across the aisle — he and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) devoted many months to a search for bipartisan police reform, though it was unsuccessful in the end.
6. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin
A presidential run would be an enormous undertaking for Youngkin, who only began his political career in 2021.
But his victory in Virginia's gubernatorial race that year laid down a roadmap for Republican politicians in competitive states.
Youngkin placed enormous emphasis on education — specifically, the right of parents to be more involved in decisionmaking, including around the academic curriculum.
The issue has become a rallying cry for the GOP.
Youngkin was also politically nimble, neither entirely embracing nor disavowing Trump.
In the end, he beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a state Biden had carried by 10 points just 12 months previously.
There are real doubts that Youngkin will jump into the race, however. He has made few moves to suggest a bid is imminent.
7. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott
Abbott, beginning his third term as governor of a huge state, should be a serious contender.
Abbott is perhaps best known nationally for his tough stances on migration, though critics to his left accuse him of ""stunts"" for his deployment of the Texas National Guard to the border and his tactic of transporting migrants to other states.
Abbott is often underrated politically. His reelection victory in November saw him dispatching one-time Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke with ease.
The problem for Abbott, if he runs, is DeSantis.
The Florida governor has a very similar approach and agenda — and he has drawn far more support to his side.
8. Former Vice President Mike Pence
Pence has been very public about the fact that he is mulling a run. Just this week, he traveled to Iowa, where he held a rally focused on parents' rights in Cedar Rapids.
Pence has deep roots among Christian conservatives, and the Iowa caucuses would be critical for him.
He has a clear vulnerability, however. In opinion polls, he has notably higher disapproval ratings among Republican voters than most other potential GOP contenders.
Those numbers are surely a legacy of Pence's refusal to back Trump's illegal plan to overturn the 2020 election, and his subsequent criticism of the former president.
But, as a fact of political life, that history makes it hard to see a realistic path for him to become the GOP's 2024 nominee.
9. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
Pompeo told The Hill in a video interview earlier this week that he was not yet leaning one way or another as he and his family mull a presidential bid.
""There's no lean,"" he said. ""It's kind of binary. It's a zero or one.""
In the same interview, Pompeo promised a substantive campaign in which, he said, ""We'll go make arguments. It's not about tweets, it's not about noise, it's not about 'owning the libs.' It's about presenting a rational argument about how to get our government to function.""
Pompeo has a hard-hitter's resume. Prior to being Trump's secretary of State, he was director of the CIA. Before that, he served three full terms representing Kansas's 4th Congressional District in the House.
The problem for Pompeo, if he goes ahead with a campaign, will be how to distinguish himself from other candidates.
It's simply not clear what his unique selling point is.
10. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem
Many campaign cycles throw up a dark-horse candidate who unexpectedly gathers momentum.
Noem could end up filling that role in 2024.
She is closely in sync with the MAGA wing of the party, in part due to her early and vigorous opposition to coronavirus-related mandates. This week, she told the libertarian Cato Institute that states that pursued more restrictive polices had been engaged in a ""power grab that frankly in this country should be alarming to us.""
Noem is an accomplished media performer. And, for Republican voters who find the idea of a female nominee particularly appealing, she is more of a firebrand than Haley.
She suffers somewhat because her home state is so far removed from major media markets — and from the cities where most big GOP donors are based.
But she is adept at gaining national attention. In recent months, she became one of the first and most prominent GOP critics of TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app that is the focus of numerous fears regarding data privacy and national security.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Trump Backs Nikki Haley's Call for Pols Over 75 to Face Fitness Tests,2023-02-23T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-trump-backs-nikki-haleys-call-for-pols-over-75-face-fitness,"
New York Post by Mark Moore
?Former President Donald Trump came out Tuesday in support of Republican rival Nikki Haley's proposal for mental competency tests for politicians 75 and older, adding that presidential candidates should also be tested on their physical abilities.
""ANYBODY running for the Office of President of the United States should agree to take a full & complete Mental Competency Test simultaneously (or before!) with the announcement that he or she is running, & likewise, but to a somewhat lesser extent, agree to a test which would prove that you are physically capable of doing the job?,"" Trump, 76, said on his Truth Social messaging platform.?
""?Being an outstanding President requires great mental acuity & physical stamina. If you don't have these qualities or traits, it is likely you won't succeed. MAGA!?"" he continued.
Trump famously touted acing a cognitive test when he was president, telling Fox News in a 2020 interview that he stunned the doctors with his memory.
The exam consisted of repeating five words in precise order — person, woman, man, camera, TV — after a short delay.
""And you go: 'Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.' If you get it in order, you get extra points,"" Trump said at the time. ""They said nobody gets it in order. It's actually not that easy, but for me, it was easy.""
He also suggested that then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden should take the same test.
""Joe should take that test because something is going on, and I say this with respect,"" Trump said. ""I mean, [it's] going to probably happen to all of us, right? You know, it's going to happen. But we can't take a chance of it happening.""
Haley, 51, the former US ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, called for a new generation of leaders when she announced her presidential bid last week in South Carolina, saying lawmakers should be subject to term limits and those 75 and older should have to prove their mental fitness.
""We're ready,"" ?said Haley, also the former governor of South Carolina. ""Ready to move past the stale ideas and faded names of the past. And we are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into the future.""
So far, she is the only Republican who has formally announced that they will challenge Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.
Trump launched his third bid for the White House Nov. 15, a week after the midterm elections.
Haley's call for mental competency tests was widely seen as a jab at Trump and Biden, who at 80 is the country's oldest-ever president.
""When America is distracted, the world is less safe? ?—? ?and today, our enemies think the American era has passed. They're wrong. America is not past our prime. It's just that our politicians are past theirs?,"" Haley said at her campaign kickoff.
Republicans have long criticized Biden for his many verbal gaffes and have called on him to take a cognitive test. ?
Biden got a clean bill of health last week after his annual physical, but his doctor didn't say whether he examined the president's mental acuity.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Nikki Haley Endorsed by Top Trump Ally Ralph Norman Who Says GOP Needs 'New Leadership',2023-02-23T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-nikki-haley-endorsed-top-trump-ally-ralph-norman-who-says-gop,"
Fox News by Kelly Laco
EXCLUSIVE: Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has secured the endorsement of a top Trump ally, House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Ralph Norman, for her first South Carolina delegation show of support as she launches her 2024 run for president.
Ralph Norman is the first South Carolina lawmaker to publicly back Haley's bid for presidency. His support comes despite former President Donald Trump's endorsement of his re-election the 2022 midterm elections and also after Norman did not vote to certify the 2020 election, in a nod to his loyalty to Trump.
Norman addressed the elephant in the room, saying that the Republican Party is looking for a ""new vision"" at the top of the ticket.
""In 2016, President Trump was exactly who the Republican Party needed at the time. For too long, Republicans had been marginalized. Then Trump came along and reminded us how to fight what we believe. We are better off now for what President Trump accomplished while he was president,"" Norman told Fox News Digital.
""However, the Republican Party has entered a season of change. We're at a pivotal juncture, and most of the Republicans I know are now looking for new leadership with a new vision at the top of the ticket. Nikki Haley has that vision, and she's going to be an outstanding President,"" Norman continued.
Norman's endorsement comes as another top South Carolina Republican, Sen. Tim Scott, is expected to also join the 2024 presidential race.
Haley and Norman were elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 2004 and Norman was the first public official to endorse her 2010 run for governor.
""You always know exactly where Nikki stands. From her time in the statehouse and as governor, there was never a shred of doubt she would do what she believed was right for the people she served,"" Norman added.
""Even as governor, everyone knew she was destined for bigger things,"" he told Fox News Digital.
Haley announced Tuesday that she is running for president, seeking the Republican nomination for the 2024 election.
In a video message posted on Twitter, Haley touted her record as South Carolina's governor, while looking to the future and the needs of the country.
Her official announcement is expected Wednesday in Charleston, South Carolina.

Breitbart by Matthew Boyle
CHARLESTON, South Carolina — 2024 Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley told Breitbart News exclusively that if she were president that China would never have sent up a spy balloon in the first place.
Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and later U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under then-President Donald Trump, launched her presidential campaign last week and then sat for an exclusive interview with Breitbart News before heading to New Hampshire and Iowa to campaign.
""Let's be clear: If I was president, China never would have sent a balloon in the first place,"" Haley told Breitbart News. ""The reason that China sent a balloon is that they saw us fall in Afghanistan and then saw us let Russia into Crimea and then watched Russia invade Ukraine. America really hasn't done anything. They watched Biden fall over himself to get into the Iran deal. So they are saying 'let's get away with it.' How weak do we look that China felt comfortable to send a balloon across our border? What took Biden so long? They should have captured it before it even entered. We need to go to NORAD and say 'what are you doing? You guys are supposed to be seeing this?' We need to hold China accountable. They don't get a pass on this.""
When asked what specifically she would do as president to hold China accountable, Haley told Breitbart News that it is time for leaders in both parties to start treating China differently across the board. She said the U.S. needs to secure supply chains and stop China from stealing intellectual property and building influence operations in U.S. universities.
""We have to start treating China differently. Republicans and Democrats, for too long, thought if we were nice to China they would want to be like us,"" Haley said. ""They don't want to be like us. They are Communists. They look at the west as devils. They look at the west as great evil. They want to make their way our way. What we have to do is we have to stop the funding in universities, we have to stop the stealing of intellectual property, we have to build up our military so they know we're serious, and we have to make sure that they know when you pass a balloon across our borders that there is hell to pay. We have to start making sure our supply chain is focused on America and focused on our allies. We don't need to be having trade with China, especially when it comes to national security items.""
In her launch speech, Haley compared the Chinese Communist Party to the old Soviet Union which fell after a decades-long Cold War. ""In the America I see, Communist China won't just lose,"" Haley said in the speech. ""Like the Soviet Union before it, Communist China will end up on the ash-heap of history.""
Asked during the interview with Breitbart News if she views the conflict between the United States and China as a second Cold War, Haley said it depends on what China does.
""It's up to China. What we have to do is let China know what we expect of them,"" Haley said. ""If we let them know what we expect of them, they won't mess with us. The problem is they can tell Biden's not even paying attention. To allow Americans to look at the sky and see a Chinese spy balloon is the biggest embarrassment our country has faced in a long time. It's very telling to the international world. We have to fix it.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Exclusive – Nikki Haley on E-Verify: 'Americans Need to Get These Jobs',2023-02-22T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-exclusive-nikki-haley-e-verify-americans-need-get-these-jobs,"
Breitbart by Matthew Boyle
CHARLESTON, South Carolina — Newly-announced 2024 Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley told Breitbart News exclusively that if elected president she hopes to steer jobs to Americans, and not allow illegal aliens to get work in the United States.
Haley, who was governor of South Carolina and later served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under then-President Donald Trump, announced her campaign for president on Wednesday. After her announcement speech, Haley sat for an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on stage on a number of issues including immigration and China.
During her speech, she touted one of the toughest immigration laws in the country which she signed as governor of South Carolina called Senate Bill 20. That law, among other things, implemented statewide E-Verify requirements — and provided the governor the resources and ability to enforce it and penalize companies that hired illegal aliens over Americans.
""We are a country of laws,"" Haley told Breitbart News when asked about the E-Verify measure. ""The second you stop being a country of laws you give up everything this country was founded on. We have got to secure our borders. The fabric of America is legal immigration but those processes have to be in place. We are not going to give people a pass to get into this country. My parents came here legally. They put in the time, they put in the price. They're offended by what's happening on the border.""
When asked to expand on the issue, including specifically how she is looking at immigration as an economic issue by talking about E-Verify, Haley told Breitbart News that Americans need to get job opportunities that become available — not illegal aliens.
""What we did in South Carolina with E-Verify was you had to verify that that person was in this country legally or else you could not hire them,"" Haley said. ""That's what we put in place in South Carolina, and more importantly we enforced it. When you enforce it, one, that stops everybody from coming across the border. Two, it puts laws in place that matter. Americans need to get these jobs. We need Americans building things again. We need Americans working again. We don't need to pay them to sit on the couch. We need to get them to work, but we have to have the jobs ready for them when we get them there.""
Haley said that as president she would visit the border — something Democrat President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have consistently refused to do — and that she would listen to Border Patrol agents about their needs and priorities.
""Absolutely, I would go to the border — and not only that, I would listen to Border Patrol families and listen to what Border Patrol agents say they need,"" Haley said. ""Don't sit there and listen to what people in D.C. say they need. Listen to those Border Patrol agents because they're having to deal with it every single day.""
Haley also said she thinks Biden, by giving Harris the border crisis as an issue assignment, may have been trying to throw her under the bus.
""I don't know if Biden was trying to throw Kamala under the bus, but naming her the border czar and then looking at what she's done because of it has been a total joke. It cannot continue,"" Haley said. ""She's not talking about it. He's not talking about it. She's not going to the border. He's not going to the border. At some point, someone has to go to the border.""
Haley also touted her time working in the Trump administration and pointed to the successful policies under Trump, such as his deals with northern triangle countries including Guatemala and his Remain in Mexico deal with the Mexican government, as policies that were working. She ripped Biden for eliminating those policies and said as president she would reimplement the Trump immigration successes.
""I worked with President Trump as he was dealing with that immigration situation,"" Haley said. ""I was in Honduras and Guatemala and we were talking to those leaders about how they needed to keep their people there. What the last administration did worked. Biden broke it. The idea that they had Remain in Mexico, the idea that they were building the wall, the idea that we had secure borders — all of that matters. And, Joe Biden went and broke every bit of it and we've seen the largest outbreak across the border we've ever seen and a number of terrorists crossing the border. He broke something that really worked and now we're having to go back and do that all over again.""

Haley Campaign Press Release - Three Reasons Nikki Haley's Candidacy is a Race to Watch,2023-02-22T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-three-reasons-nikki-haleys-candidacy-race-watch,"
The Hill by Geoff Duncan
Here's a prediction: If the 2024 general election is between Nikki Haley and Joe Biden, America will have its first woman president. It won't be a Democrat focused on the glass ceiling, but a conservative daughter of immigrants from South Carolina who dismissed identity politics in her kickoff speech.
Of course, that is a tall order for an untested candidate polling at 1 percent in a Monmouth University survey. It is contingent on navigating the choppy waters of a growing GOP primary field likely awash with others arguing for generational change. It requires a compelling and clear rationale for her candidacy and addressing lingering questions about former President Donald Trump, the person whose administration she served and once vowed not to compete against.
But Haley's strengths should not be underestimated, especially these three.
First, she has foreign policy chops. After four items were shot out of the skies in eight days without explanation, Americans are unsettled. Speculation is running so rampant that the White House press secretary declared ""no indication of aliens."" Meanwhile, the war between Ukraine and Russia is escalating at its one-year mark, and the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan remains a blemish.
From her tenure as United Nations ambassador, Haley has experience on the international stage. On her watch, the United States recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, approved new sanctions against North Korea and spoke out against the world's worst human rights abusers.
Second, the state Haley was elected twice to govern and the broader southeast region is flourishing. From Georgia to Florida to South Carolina, it's no accident that some of the most prominent names in the GOP hail from the region. It's also more than just a warm climate. Thriving economies and the COVID-19 pandemic are fueling these migration patterns.
Under Haley's tenure, South Carolina's unemployment rate hit a 15-year low. Last year its population grew at the third fastest rate in the nation.
Third, as a former governor, Haley can fall back on her executive experience. From mass shootings to hurricanes to negotiating a bipartisan compromise removing the Confederate flag from the Statehouse, her tenure in Columbia was eventful. Unlike senators, governors have more responsibilities than delivering floor speeches or attending hearings. This is a useful contrast point not only in a primary but also with President Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate and arrived at the White House with no executive experience beyond his time in the Obama administration.
Of course, Haley faces challenges from her left and right, especially around Trump. Following her 2018 resignation from his administration, even the New York Times editorial page praised her as ""that rarest of Trump appointees: one who can exit the administration with her dignity largely intact."" Yet Haley famously pledged not to run against Trump in 2024, a promise she is now breaking. It was not the political death knell for a first-term senator named Barack Obama who ruled out a presidential run in 2006 only to reverse course two years later.
In the days after the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol, Haley predicted Trump would not, ""run for federal office again."" Queried on his conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, she would only say, ""he believes it.""
These issues alone may not sink Haley in a GOP primary but expect her rivals to highlight the inconsistencies to raise questions about her character. Some of her colleagues in the Trump administration, including her old boss, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have grumbled about her decision to leave early. The Wall Street Journal editorial board raised questions about her, ""speaking in the absence of knowledge.""
Above all, electability has never been a persuasive argument for Republican voters. The ability to defeat Biden will not cut it. Even with all his baggage, in some polls, Trump is still polling ahead of the sitting president. If they are being honest, many Democrats will admit that Biden's best chance of reelection hinges on Trump as the GOP standard bearer, the rematch of 2020 that 6 in 10 Americans do not want.
In fact, any Republican not named Trump would likely start as the proverbial frontrunner versus Biden. Many contemporaries of the 50-year-old Haley will be calling for generational change against the 80-year-old Biden. Haley could well be the alternative candidate, but so could any of the others preparing to make the plunge.
No doubt Nikki Haley has her work cut out for her, but it would be a mistake to write her off. Now that she is an official candidate, the true test begins.

New York Post by Post Editorial Board
Welcome to the 2024 Republican presidential race, Nikki Haley. So far, you're saying all the right things.
Haley's Tuesday announcement makes her the second declared candidate, after former President Donald Trump — under whom she served as UN ambassador. And the former South Carolina gov gently took him on by declaring that it's ""time for a new generation of leadership"" in the party in order ""to rediscover fiscal responsibility, secure our border and strengthen our country, our pride and our purpose.""
That deftly echoed Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R-Ark.), who pointedly noted in the GOP response to President Biden's State of the Union speech that a ""new generation"" of Republican leaders is ""stepping up"" to be ""changemakers for the American people.""
Others in that generation are likely to toss their hats into the '24 scrum (with many eyes on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis). Good: This far out, let all the flowers bloom. One of them should emerge as the best, far younger, alternative to Biden.
Some fear the race will grow too crowded, and so let Trump dominate. But the field has plenty of time to winnow, and the party needs some serious debate first: Battles in Washington aren't enough to settle a forward-looking, coherent GOP agenda.
We've discussed time and time again why the ex-prez is the wrong guy for '24. We look forward to the competition we have every reason to expect will produce the man or woman who can beat first Trump, now 76, and then Biden, 80.
America is so ready to move on.

Haley Campaign Press Release - 'Badass Woman' Haley Draws Big Crowd in Exeter for NH Kick-Off,2023-02-22T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-badass-woman-haley-draws-big-crowd-exeter-for-nh-kick-off,"
NH Journal by Michael Graham
Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley's message to a standing-room-only crowd at Exeter Town Hall Thursday Night was simple: If Republicans want to start winning again, they need to ""focus on new generational leadership.""
""And the best way to do that,"" Haley added, ""is to put a badass woman in the White House.""
The crowd loved it. And Haley's campaign team must have been pretty happy, too.
Before the event, some NHGOP insiders wondered if it was smart for the campaign to launch in a relatively large venue in a blue town like Exeter. But the building was packed, as curious Republicans from as far away as Maine turned out to hear Haley speak.
Ryan Terrell, the new state party vice chair, was delighted to see it. ""In the middle of Exeter to have this kind of turnout, to have standing room only, I think it's impressive. I hope it's a sign of a successful Republican campaign season.""
A packed crowd at Exeter N.H. Town Hall waiting to hear from 2024 POTUS candidate Nikki Haley.
It's even more impressive given Haley has no paid full-time staff on the ground in the state to organize turnout. And reports from the New Hampshire Institute of Politics are that her Friday night town hall is already a sellout.
""She's a very impressive Republican woman and I think she's going to find a lot of fans here,"" Terrell said.
And having retired Gen. Don Bolduc, who won last year's U.S. Senate GOP primary, on hand to introduce her likely helped, too. While he lost to incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan, Bolduc remains a popular figure in the GOP base.
""The fact that she started her campaign here in New Hampshire in a town hall is indicative of how she feels about the American people and New Hampshire,"" Bolduc said. ""This is quintessential New Hampshire — 'coffee-breath' close with your elected officials and the people who want to serve you.""
""If you supported me — and even if you didn't— I'm asking you to support her,"" Bolduc added.
Haley spoke for about 40 minutes, telling her life story and tying her experiences as South Carolina governor and U.N. Ambassador to the challenges facing the nation today. She also reminded the crowd several times that she's not a lawyer, she's an accountant.
""I've never been in D.C., but I think they need a really good accountant,"" Haley said.
Her overall theme: She's a strong, battle-tested woman who's ready for a fight.
Haley had tough talk for President Biden, in particular, his foreign policy (""What foreign policy,"" a member of the audience shouted, inspiring laughter. ""Exactly right,"" Haley responded). She decried what she described as weakness from the administration.
""You've got Biden falling all over himself to get back into an Iran deal where they say 'Death to America.' You've got North Korea shooting more missiles this year than they ever have before. And you've got China on the march — China is eating our lunch right now.
""The idea that Americans would look to the sky and see a Chinese spy balloon flying over us is nothing more than a massive national embarrassment,"" Haley said.
Haley had plenty of tough talk for China, too, arguing the U.S. needs to get real about the threat they pose.
""Biden was very quick to talk about Covid and he was really quick to say 'put your mask on.' But when you turned it over, the mask was made in China. Biden was very quick to say 'make sure you take your Covid test. If you turn it over, it was made in China.
""And guess what: if we ever have a national emergency, most of our medications will go through China. Are we crazy?""
Haley called for a ban on U.S. land sales to Chinese government entities and either on-shoring manufacturing or ""friend-shoring"" to reliable allies like Australia, India and Japan.
But perhaps most politically interesting was Haley's tough talk for Republican primary voters: If you want to win, we've got to make a change.
""I will say this to our Republicans in the room: we've lost the last seven out of eight popular votes for president. That means Republicans are doing something wrong,"" Haley said. ""We should not be okay with that. We should want to win the majority of Americans because our solutions are the right ones.
""But if we're going to do it, we have to stop leaning on the status quo of the past. We've got to stop talking about old issues and we need to start looking forward.""
Among her ideas for this forward-looking focus: term limits, and ""a mental competency test for any [politician] over the age of 75. Many Republicans saw that as a not-so-veiled reference to former President Donald Trump. As was this:
""Our road forward is no more complaining about it. We're going to do something about it. We've done enough complaining. This country's been through a lot. Aren't you tired?""
There were many heads in the crowd nodding in response.
One area where Haley's event fell flat was in the ""town hall"" aspect. Only three people asked questions, and one of them was former NHGOP vice chair Matt Mayberry, who was on hand as a volunteer helping with the event. (A fourth person took the mic to pledge his support to Haley.) The questions were about Iran, the Second Amendment and Ukraine.
The latter generated the most interest, with Haley endorsing U.S. support for Ukraine as part of the national interest to defend freedom. It's a divisive issue inside the party, and several members of the crowd told NHJournal afterward they disagreed with her position.
And several issues were notable by their absence. Very free direct references to former President Trump or the rest of the likely GOP field, and not a single mention of abortion.
Still, the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.
""I was impressed, she was able to speak without a teleprompter, she spoke off the cuff. — I completely disagree with her on Ukraine,"" said Mike McLaughlin, who said he ""bounces between Texas and New Hampshire."" And he added, ""I liked how she played the accountant card.""
Several attendees mentioned the fact Haley spoke without notes and yet never seemed to stumble.
""She gave a terrific speech, she showed power,"" said Bruce Allen of East Kingston. I give the speech a nine [on a one to ten scale]. The question is whether she can pull a team together — that means raising money and getting an organization. The speech was great. Now can she make it happen?""
""I didn't agree with everything she said but it was a good speech,"" said Charlotte Wallace of Durham. ""What impresses me most is her courage, her energy and her grace.""
Carol Dunkerly of Portland, Maine wanted a bit more on some key issues.
""I wish she had addressed the abortion issue, and I wish she had talked a little more about gun control, but I think she's charming, articulate and personable,"" Dunkerly said.
""Common sense. She reminds me of Reagan,"" added her husband, Al. ""And I think the whole thing about generational change is right on. We're tired of the old folks.""
""And we are the old folks,"" Carol chimed in.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Give Nikki Haley a Chance,2023-02-22T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-give-nikki-haley-chance,"
National Review by Jim Geraghty
On the menu today: Former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will make her presidential campaign official with an appearance in her home state this morning, and then tomorrow, she's off to New Hampshire. A lot of the early coverage of Haley is pointing out what a long shot she is; over at The Bulwark, Sarah Longwell snickers that Haley's ""the perfect Republican presidential candidate for 2015."" But as both a potential nominee and president, Haley would bring a wide range of strengths and a serious accomplishment record to the table. A lot of race-watchers seem convinced that Republican primary voters don't want that. Do they?
Nikki Haley's Record
The next president is going to face a dangerous world and sooner or later is likely to deploy U.S. troops into harm's way. It might be nice to have a president whose husband is a captain in the U.S. Army National Guard, who served for a year in Afghanistan, and whose convoys were hit with improvised explosive devices twice, thankfully with no injuries.
Upon Michael Haley's return from his deployment in 2013, then-governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley later said, ""Seeing him, I felt like I took my first breath in a year."" It might be nice to have a president for whom military deployments and the effect on military families is not an abstract issue.
The next president is going to face a complicated state of foreign relations. It might be nice to have an indisputably conservative Republican who somehow managed to convince the New York Times editorial board that she was an effective U.S. representative to the United Nations, who ""could talk as bluntly as the president himself about the failings of the United Nations system, and yet, more quietly, she proved a practitioner of multilateral diplomacy."" The Times raved, ""many United Nations diplomats valued Ms. Haley as a pragmatic envoy who could explain the president to a world confused by the chaos in Washington,"" and it praised her efforts to reform the U.N. bureaucracy and building consensus for ""tough new sanctions on North Korea.""
Haley received similar expression of surprised praise from Politico, BuzzFeed, Foreign Policy, and multiple columnists at the Washington Post. Many foreign-policy wonks thought Haley was unprepared and in over her head when she started the U.N. ambassador job. Apparently, she's a fast learner, a persuasive communicator, and has good instincts. It might be nice to have a president with traits like these.
The next president is going to face a national debt beyond $31 trillion. It might be nice to have a Republican nominee who not only balanced a budget, as required by state law, but who was willing to fight her own party on spending she deemed excessive and pushed for a simpler tax code. It might be nice if the Republican nominee could point to reducing ineffective spending in, say, the United Nations peacekeeping program, reducing the U.S. contribution by 7.5 percent and overall spending by $600 million.
The next president is going to be the head of state for a country that has lost a lot of faith in its institutions, particularly in the federal government, and a sense that few if any powerful figures are held accountable anymore. Way back in the day, as a state legislator, Haley took on her own party over the importance of having recorded votes (instead of voice votes, in which no record is made of which lawmakers approved and which opposed a particular bill or amendment). At one point, less than 10 percent of all votes in either chamber of the South Carolina state legislature were on the record. After a long, long fight, Haley signed two bills into law — in 2011 and 2016, respectively — that require the legislature to take more recorded votes,
Despite its heavily Republican voting record, the South Carolina of the late 2000s and early 2010s was not a conservative's paradise. State politics were often dominated by a powerful political establishment that liked to take care of its own and dish out favors to its friends. The state's governorship was relatively weak and its legislature was strong; Michael Barone's Almanac of American Politics cites the anecdote of former governor Mark Sanford, an indisputable fiscal conservative, issuing 106 vetoes on spending he deemed excessive and the legislature overriding 105 of them.
(At one point, it was considered controversial or scandalous that Haley's then-14-year-old daughter was working in the gift shop of the South Carolina state house, making $8 per hour, and working 20 to 25 hours per week cleaning and stocking shelves. Remember when that was considered a controversial way for the child of an elected official to earn money, in the pre-Hunter Biden or Jared Kushner Saudi deal days?)
The next president is likely to face a widespread public perception that large corporations benefit from unfair laws and rules that hold back small businesses. It might be nice to have a president who stepped down from Boeing's board of directors after less than a year because she opposed a request for $60 billion in government aid to the company during the Covid-19 pandemic, declaring that she ""cannot support a move to lean on the federal government for a stimulus or bailout that prioritizes our company over others and relies on taxpayers to guarantee our financial position. I have long held strong convictions that this is not the role of government."" As a member of the board of directors at Boeing, Haley made $256,322 in 2019 and $83,750 in 2020.
The next president is likely to face widespread public doubt that institutions of higher education are effectively preparing America's young people for the world, and instead incubating a generation of ideologically extreme, hypersensitive, fragile layabouts who are addicted to social media and incapable of overcoming adversity. Haley serves on the board of trustees of Clemson University, and often tells audiences of young people that ""they need to have three war stories they can tell, stories that involve something that made them uncomfortable but stronger in the end.""
Haley often tells audiences a version of this story:
Haley ran against Larry Koon, the longest-serving legislator in the state, and who was, she says, ""related to half the district."" During the campaign, she and her husband, sporting their ""Haley for Legislature"" badges, attended a Ducks Unlimited event. A crowd of 1,500 people was there, with a long line waiting to shake hands with the incumbent. As she tells the story, Koon's cousin got on stage and said, ""I want you to know that I'm voting for Larry Koon, and I want everyone else in this room to vote for Larry Koon."" He was greeted with massive applause.
Haley and her husband stood in line. ""I shook Mr. Koon's hand, and he said, 'See, little lady, they love me.' And I said, 'Yes sir, they do.'"" Haley spent the rest of the evening, shaking every hand she could, to make sure, she says, ""that they knew I wasn't leaving.""
On Monday, she visited Mr. Koon's cousin in his office. ""Hey, I'm Nikki Haley, and I'm running for State House. I wanted to talk to you,"" she said. ""I just wanted you to know why I'm running.""
He responded, ""I just told over a thousand people I'm voting for him, and they should, too.""
She acknowledged that but asked him to hear her out. ""I told him why I was running,"" she says. ""It was no disrespect to the incumbent, but I just thought we needed something different.""
After she was done, he thanked her and said, ""But what do you want from me?""
With just a little more than chutzpah, Haley responded, ""I don't want you to put my yard sign in your front yard. But in your small circles, I want you to tell people what I had to say, and that you liked what I had to say.
""And before I leave, I need a thousand dollars.""
And he gave it.
It was a tough primary, and a runoff that got ugly, focusing on religion, on nationality, on gender. But she won it by a 10-point margin.
We know the Democrats and their allies will contend that the Republican Party is misogynistic. It might be helpful to have a nominee who is a woman. We know the Democrats and their allies will contend that the Republican Party is full of ""white nationalists,"" and is xenophobic and anti-immigrant. It might be helpful to have a nominee who is the daughter of Indian immigrants.
Much like the man she appointed to the U.S. Senate, Tim Scott, Haley tends to bring out the worst, ugliest, and most hateful sides of her critics. Figures from Ann Coulter to South Carolina Democratic chairman Dick Harpootlian have ""joked"" that Haley is not really an American and ""should go back to where she comes from."" Apparently, it doesn't matter if you're born in Bamberg, go to Clemson, live in South Carolina almost your entire life, build a business, sit on the board of your church, donate $130,000 to charity in one year, and have a husband in the Army National Guard who serves in Afghanistan for a year . . . you will still face ""You're not one of us"" crap.
That ugly, hard-fought 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary included some questioning of whether Haley was truly a Christian. (Some people may forget, David Brody, but I don't.)
Haley has her flaws and her missteps and unresolved problems from her days as governor. She will face tough questions about her past statements about President Trump, and whether, when push comes to shove, she ultimately should be seen as more of an ally or more of a critic of Trump. Back in April 2021, she said that if Trump was running, she would not run for president, and Republicans will ask fair questions about what changed and why.
But a good and serious Republican Party would give Haley real consideration as a potential nominee, noting that her depth and breadth of experience and combination of indisputable toughness and charisma on the stump represent a rare combination of strengths in a potential president who is only 51 years old.

Fox News by Anders Hagstorm
Newly announced presidential candidate Nikki Haley called for a universal rule requiring politicians over the age of 75 to take ""mental competency tests"" before running for office.
Haley pushed for the new rule while speaking at her campaign announcement event in South Carolina on Wednesday. Her proposed rule would impact at least two expected 2024 presidential candidates — former President Donald Trump, 76, who has declared his candidacy, and President Biden, 80, who has not yet made his plans official.
""In the America I see, the permanent politician will finally retire,"" Haley said. ""We'll have term limits for Congress and mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.""
Haley's proposal comes as voters on both sides of the aisle have expressed frustration with how old their candidates are. Republicans have also lambasted Biden for his age and frequent gaffes, which they attribute to a loss of competency.
The competency check was just one of many policies Haley pushed during her announcement Wednesday. The candidate received endorsements from members of Congress and from Cindy Warmbier, the mother of Otto Warmbier.
Haley's campaign kickoff event came one day after she officially declared her candidacy for president, emphasizing in a social media video that ""it's time for a new generation of leadership.""
""America is not past its prime, it's just that our politicians are past theirs,"" Haley said in her first campaign speech, as the crowd chanted ""USA!"" and ""Nikki!""
Haley is the second major Republican to officially enter the 2024 presidential race, with Trump announcing his own candidacy last year. Other likely candidates include former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

CHARLESTON, S.C. – As she formally kicked off her 2024 Republican presidential campaign, former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley had a message for the large crowd of supporters gathering to hear her speak in this historic coastal city.
""As I set out on this new journey, I will simply say this. May the best woman win,"" Haley, the first female governor in South Carolina and the nation's first female governor of Asian American heritage said to loud cheers.
That message resonated with many in the audience of Haley supporters and other Republicans packed into Charleston's visitors center.
""I love her chances. I think she would do an amazing job as president,"" Melissa from Charleston told Fox News Digital.
Haley, who joins former President Donald Trump as the only major Republicans to launch campaigns to date in the 2024 GOP presidential nomination race, repeatedly took aim at 80-year-old President Biden.
""America is not past our prime, it's just that our politicians are past theirs,"" Haley charged.

""America is not past our prime, it's just that our politicians are past theirs,"" Haley charged.
Niki, a Haley supporter who traveled to Charleston from Florence, South Carolina, was holding a copy of the former UN ambassador's latest book.
""I love Nikki,"" she stressed. ""She's a smart, strong, woman. She's got the fight and I believe she could go all the way.""
And Niki pointedly said she ""would like to see a woman nominated"" as the GOP standard-bearer.
Her husband Reed chimed in, highlighting ""we like what she's [Haley] saying. It's what we believe.""
And pointing to the first woman to jump into the White House race this cycle, Reed offered ""I think she has a good chance because of that.""
But asked about the field — which eventually may also include likely contenders such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and others — Reed acknowledged ""I'll back whoever gets nominated.""
Dave, who lives in upstate New York but owns property in South Carolina, said ""think her chances are pretty good.""
The Army veteran who raises horses emphasized that Haley ""said a lot of things that appealed to this crowd"" and added that he will ""absolutely"" volunteer on her campaign.
Looking to the burgeoning GOP presidential field, Dave predicted ""it's going to be a strong campaign this year.""

"Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Charleston, South Carolina",2023-02-15T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/remarks-announcing-candidacy-for-president-charleston-south-carolina-0,"
Thank you! It's a great day in South Carolina!
Thank you all for being here.
I'm so glad to be with the people I love, in the state I love, to talk about saving the country I love.
I have always had a deep belief in America.
But I know America is better than all the division and distractions we have today.
And I'm confident the American people agree…
We're ready… ready to move past the stale ideas and faded names of the past…
And we are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into the future!
I come here today with a vision of that future.
I see a strong America – full of opportunity, that lifts up everyone, not just a select few.
I see a proud America – confident in who we are, and what we stand for.
And I see America leading the world – in freedom and peace.
But this vision isn't just mine.
It's the core of our nation's history…and it called to my parents over fifty years ago.
I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants.
My parents left India in search of a better life.
They found it in Bamberg, South Carolina – population, 2,500.
Our little town came to love us, but it wasn't always easy. We were the only Indian family.
Nobody knew who we were, what we were, or why we were there.
But my parents knew.
And every day, they reminded me, my brothers, and my sister that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America.
They were right then – and they're right now.
My parents came to a country that was gaining strength and growing in confidence.
But that was then.
Now America is falling behind.
Our future is slipping. Our leaders are failing us.
And no one embodies that failure more than Joe Biden.
Right now, in the greatest country in human history, we have too many families paying too much for groceries; too many mothers searching frantically for baby formula; and too many children who are so far behind in the classroom, they might never get ahead.
We have too many small businesses who can't afford rent, and too many big businesses getting taxpayer bailouts.
We have too much crime on our streets – too many drugs flooding our cities – and too few police and border patrol.
And from Joe Biden on down, our leaders put too much trust in big government and too little trust in the American people.
They have us spiraling toward socialism, with a new trillion-dollar spending bill every few months, and a national debt over 30 trillion dollars.
This is not the America that called to my parents…
And make no mistake: This is not the America I will leave to my children!
We must stop socialism, before it's too late. It's weakening America from within.
But there's something else eating away at our national core.
On Biden and Harris's watch, a self-loathing has swept our country.
It's in the classroom, the boardroom, and the backrooms of government.
Every day, we're told America is flawed, rotten, and full of hate. Joe and Kamala even say America is racist.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The American people know better. My immigrant parents know better…
And take it from the first minority female Governor in history: America is not a racist country!
This self-loathing is a virus more dangerous than any pandemic.
It's a symptom of a lack of pride in our country and a lack of trust in our leaders.
And it ignores the values that have sustained America since our founding.
I have traveled around the world and back. I've seen what else is out there.
America isn't perfect. But the principles at America's core are perfect.
And the American people are not full of hate. We are full of love – and we are sustained by faith.
I always go back to the Book of Joshua:
Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged. For God will be with you wherever you go.
Strengthening America — believing once again in America — is the only way to defend ourselves from those who want to destroy us.
When America is distracted, the world is less safe…
And today, our enemies think the American era has passed.
They're wrong. America is not past our prime. It's just that our politicians are past theirs!
Joe Biden isn't even leading from behind. He's not leading at all.
On his watch, a terrorist mob conquered Afghanistan – and killed our troops.
Iran is on the brink of getting the bomb.
North Korea is launching more missiles than ever.
Russia started the biggest war in Europe in 75 years.
And in Communist China, we face the strongest and most disciplined enemy in history.
It is unthinkable that Americans would look at the sky and see a Chinese spy balloon looking back at us.
China's dictators want to cover the world in communist tyranny. And we're the only ones who can stop them.
But let me be clear. We won't win the fight for the 21st Century if we keep trusting politicians from the 20th Century.
America is on a path of doubt, division, and self-destruction. A path of fading patriotism and weakening power.
The stakes are nothing less than our survival.
And you and I and every American is being summoned to take bold action.
And so, I have an announcement to make.
I stand before you as the daughter of immigrants – as a proud wife of a combat veteran – and as the mom of two amazing children…
I've served as Governor of the great state of South Carolina – and as America's ambassador to the United Nations…
And above all else, I'm a grateful American citizen who knows our best days are yet to come, if we unite and fight to save our country.
I have devoted my life to this fight. And I'm just getting started.
For a strong America…
For a proud America…
I am running for President of the United States of America!
When I look to the future, I see America strong once more.
We'll end inflation and build an economy that works for all, just like we did here in South Carolina.
In the America I see, every child gets a world-class education – because every parent gets to pick their child's school. And no politician will be able to close those schools ever again!
In the America I see, police know we have their backs – criminals know we have their number – and our streets will be safe again!
In the America I see, we stop the surge of drugs and illegal immigration. That means having a real border and mandatory e-verify, like we got done in South Carolina. Businesses must hire Americans – not illegals!
In the America I see, everyone has full confidence in our elections. Voter ID will be the law of the land – like we did in South Carolina!
The America I see is freer and better for all – because Washington will finally serve the people instead of the political class.
We'll end corporate welfare and bailouts for big business – and we'll end the earmarks and pork that fuel big government.
And when it comes to our politicians, we'll light a fire under them…
Their job is not to say things on TV. Their job is to do things in DC – like solve problems instead of ignoring or creating them!
In the America I see, the permanent politician will finally retire…
We'll have term limits for Congress – and mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old!
Most of all, I see a strong America because I see a proud America.
Strong and proud – not weak and woke – that's the America I see!
The America I see will win the fight for the 21st Century.
We'll have the courage and confidence to defend our values and defeat our enemies.
In this America, the Armed Forces of the United States will be stronger and more capable than ever.
A strong military doesn't start wars. A strong military prevents wars!
In this America, we'll start pumping more oil and gas – and stop buying dirty oil from Venezuela.
We'll stand with our allies – from Israel to Ukraine – and stand up to our enemies – in Iran and Russia.
And in the America I see, Communist China won't just lose…
Like the Soviet Union before it, Communist China will end up on the ash-heap of history!
Realizing this vision won't be easy. It will take an unparalleled level of commitment from all of us.
It requires faith and a willingness to move past the status quo.
And it will require doing some things we've never done…
Like sending a tough-as-nails woman to the White House.
We need someone who can shake up Washington and the political class.
I've done it before – starting right here.
I will always be grateful to the people of South Carolina who took a chance on me.
When I ran against the longest-serving legislator in the state, no one said I had a shot, but together we won.
When I ran for Governor, people said, ""Nikki who?"" But together, we won.
Then we cut taxes, created thousands of jobs, and revitalized our economy.
Business journals started calling South Carolina the Beast of the Southeast – which I loved!
When President Trump nominated me for Ambassador to the United Nations, people said I didn't have the experience.
Then I went to work.
I told the world that America would have the backs of our allies, and for those who did not have our backs, we were taking names!
The dictators, murderers, and thieves at the UN didn't know what hit them.
I've been underestimated before. That's always fun!
And I've been shaking up the status quo my entire life.
As I set out on this new journey, I will simply say this…
May the best woman win.
All kidding aside, this is not about identity politics. I don't believe in that. And I don't believe in glass ceilings either.
I believe in creating a country where anyone can do anything and achieve their own American Dream.
The college student who's paying too much, and getting too little from her education…
The young adult, in his first real job, wondering how he'll ever afford a mortgage or start a family…
The single mom working two jobs and three times harder than everyone else…
The small-town dad, who saw the factory leave town and thinks his future went with it…
I am fighting for all of us – because all of us have to be in this together!
But hear this.
Unity does not come from faint hearts or watered-down compromises. That just leaves everyone wanting more.
Real national unity comes from boldly proclaiming our national purpose and persuading opponents to join us.
My purpose is to save our country from the downward spiral of socialism and defeatism.
I aim to move America upward toward freedom and strength.
I'll take this message far and wide in the days ahead.
And I have a particular message for my fellow Republicans.
We've lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections.
Our cause is right, but we have failed to win the confidence of a majority of Americans.
Well, that ends today.
If you're tired of losing, then put your trust in a new generation.
And if you want to win – not just as a party, but as a country – then stand with me!
As my family and I start this journey, we ask for your prayers. And yes, of course, we ask for your vote.
But there's something else we need even more. Something our country needs above all else…
It's your spirit and your belief in America.
Look past the failed ideas and leaders in Washington – and find the courage to be part of the solution.
Cast off the fear that our best days are behind us – and join the movement for our country's renewal.
See the same America I see… and stand for America, together with me.
I'm more confident than ever that we can make this vision real in our time – because that's what I've seen my entire life.
As a brown girl, growing up in a black-and-white world, I saw the promise of America unfold before me.
As the proud wife of a combat veteran, I saw our people's deep love of freedom, and determination to defend it.
As Governor, I saw our state move beyond hate and violence, and lift up everyone in peace.
And as Ambassador, I saw that America is still the standard.
Where we lead, the world follows. When we speak, the world listens. Who we are, the world wants to be.
I'll never forget the day, as ambassador, when I stood on the Simon Bolivar bridge between Colombia and Venezuela in South America.
I watched thousands of Venezuelans walk by, holding their babies, in the hot sun for hours, to get the one meal they might have that day. Where they came from, they'd been killing zoo animals for food.
They were fleeing socialism… and yearning for freedom.
When I left the bridge, the families started to gather around me. I didn't understand why they flocked to someone they'd never met.
And then it hit me.
They didn't care who I was. They cared where I was from.
In me, they saw America… and in America, they saw hope.
The time has come to renew that spirit and rally our people.
Our moment is now. Our mission is clear.
Let's save our country and secure our future. And let's move forward, together, toward our destiny – in a strong and proud America!
Thank you! God bless you! And God bless America!

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Calls for 'Mental Competency Tests' for Politicians Over 75,2023-02-15T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-calls-for-mental-competency-tests-for-politicians-over,"
The Hill  by Max Greenwood
Nikki Haley, the newly minted Republican presidential candidate, called on Wednesday for mandatory ""mental competency tests"" for politicians older than 75, an implied dig at President Biden and her onetime boss, former President Trump.
Speaking at a rally in Charleston, S.C., kicking off her 2024 White House bid, Haley ran through a litany of political promises, including enacting term limits for members of Congress and cracking down on illegal immigration.
But it was a vow to impose mandatory cognitive tests on older officeholders that underscored the central message of her campaign: that the United States needs a younger leader after previously electing two of the oldest men to ever occupy the White House.
""In the America I see, the permanent politician will finally retire,"" Haley said. ""We'll have term limits for Congress and mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.""
Her remarks reflect a growing sentiment within both parties that their standard-bearers — Biden in the Democrats' case, and Trump for Republicans — are simply too old to continue on in the White House. Trump would be 78 by the time he'd be hypothetically sworn in again as president, while Biden would be 82.
Republicans in particular have repeatedly questioned Biden's cognitive state, seizing on a series of gaffes to argue that he's not mentally fit to serve in the White House.
Haley announced her campaign on Tuesday in a video posted online, becoming the first major Republican to mount a challenge to Trump, who is once again seeking the GOP's presidential nod. She's expected to travel to Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to hold Republican nominating contests, later this week.
While Haley may be one of the first 2024 candidates out of the gate, she still faces a rocky path to securing her party's nomination. For the time being, Trump remains the GOP contest's ostensible front-runner, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appears to be the most viable alternative. Haley's support, meanwhile, is mired in the single digits.

Haley Campaign Press Release - Haley Criticizes US 'Self-loathing': America is Not a Racist Country,2023-02-15T00:00:00+00:00,Nikki Haley,/documents/haley-campaign-press-release-haley-criticizes-us-self-loathing-america-not-racist-country,"
The Hill by Julia Manchester
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley criticized what she said was a ""self-loathing"" taking over the U.S. and dismissed accusations that the country is racist during her campaign launch Wednesday in Charleston, S.C.
""A self-loathing has swept our country. It's in the classroom, the boardroom and the backrooms of government,"" Haley said, speaking to supporters. ""Every day, we're told America is flawed, rotten and full of hate. Joe [Biden] and Kamala [Harris] even say America is racist. Nothing could be further from the truth.""
The remarks show how Haley is wading into culture war issues as a part of her campaign. In her launch video released on Tuesday, Haley's campaign showed a montage of photos, including one from The 1619 Project and a sign reading ""Racism is a pandemic.""
""Some look at our past as evidence that America's founding principles are bad. They say the promise of freedom is just made up,"" Haley said in the video. ""Some think our ideas are not just wrong but racist and evil. Nothing could be further from the truth.""
Haley, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, also used her launch address on Wednesday to highlight her own background.
""I am a proud daughter of Indian immigrants,"" Haley said. ""My parents left India in search of a better life. They lived in South Carolina. Our town came to love us, but it wasn't always easy. We were the only Indian family.""
Haley is the second Republican to throw their hat into the 2024 primary ring, following her ex-boss former President Trump. Haley previously served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration.
On Wednesday, she also called for new blood in GOP leadership.
